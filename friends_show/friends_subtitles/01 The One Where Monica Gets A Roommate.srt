1
00:00:46,192 --> 00:00:48,690
There's nothing to tell.
It's just some guy I work with.

2
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,570
You're going out with the guy.

3
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,922
There has to be something
wrong with him.

4
00:00:54,251 --> 00:00:55,749
So does he have a hump
and a hairpiece?

5
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,407
Wait, does he eat chalk?

6
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:03,461
I don't want her to go through
what I did with Carl.

7
00:01:04,313 --> 00:01:04,809
Okay, everybody relax.

8
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:06,814
This is not even a date.

9
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:09,547
It's just two people going out
to dinner and not having sex.

10
00:01:10,142 --> 00:01:11,164
Sounds like a date to me.

11
00:01:14,647 --> 00:01:16,606
I'm in high school,
in the cafeteria..

12
00:01:17,736 --> 00:01:19,834
and I realize I'm totally naked.

13
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:21,963
I've had that dream.

14
00:01:22,815 --> 00:01:24,560
Then I look down and I realize
there is a phone...

15
00:01:25,783 --> 00:01:27,919
there.

16
00:01:29,418 --> 00:01:30,788
- Instead of
- That's right!

17
00:01:31,753 --> 00:01:32,644
Never had that one.

18
00:01:33,496 --> 00:01:35,429
All of a sudden,
the phone starts to ring.

19
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:38,586
And it turns out it's my mother.

20
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:44,229
Which is very, very weird
because she never calls me.

21
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:53,965
He says, "Hello,"
I want to kill myself.

22
00:01:55,993 --> 00:01:56,778
You okay?

23
00:01:57,435 --> 00:01:59,016
I feel like someone pulled my
intestine out of my mouth...

24
00:01:59,943 --> 00:02:03,570
and tied it around my neck.
- Cookie?

25
00:02:06,215 --> 00:02:07,270
Carol moved her stuff out today.

26
00:02:08,334 --> 00:02:09,913
- Let me get you some coffee.
- Thanks.

27
00:02:14,741 --> 00:02:18,281
No, don't!
Stop cleansing my aura.

28
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,813
- Just leave my aura alone, okay?
- Fine, be murky.

29
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,584
- I'll be fine. I hope she'll be happy.

30
00:02:27,346 --> 00:02:27,770
No, you don't.

31
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:28,839
To hell with her. She left me!

32
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,823
And you never knew she was a lesbian.

33
00:02:36,648 --> 00:02:40,975
Why does everyone
keep fixating on that?

34
00:02:43,532 --> 00:02:45,003
She didn't know.
How should I know?

35
00:02:48,025 --> 00:02:49,683
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.

36
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:53,136
Did I say that out loud?

37
00:02:55,997 --> 00:02:59,276
Look, you're feeling
a lot of pain right now.

38
00:03:00,162 --> 00:03:01,439
You're angry. You're hurting.

39
00:03:02,567 --> 00:03:03,149
Can I tell you what
the answer is?

40
00:03:05,016 --> 00:03:05,897
Strip joints!

41
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:12,334
See, but I don't want
to be single, okay?

42
00:03:13,117 --> 00:03:14,904
I just want to be married again.

43
00:03:19,364 --> 00:03:21,567
And I just want a million dollars!

44
00:03:24,098 --> 00:03:25,020
Rachel?

45
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,550
Oh, God, Monica!
Hi! Thank God!

46
00:03:29,191 --> 00:03:29,982
I went to your building and
this guy with a hammer said...

47
00:03:30,816 --> 00:03:31,714
...that you might be here and you are.

48
00:03:33,902 --> 00:03:35,331
-Can I get you some coffee?
-Decaf.

49
00:03:37,632 --> 00:03:41,040
Everybody, this is Rachel,
another Lincoln High survivor.

50
00:03:41,934 --> 00:03:44,320
This is everybody.
Chandler and Phoebe..

51
00:03:45,071 --> 00:03:46,739
...and Joey. And remember
my brother, Ross?

52
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:47,803
Sure!

53
00:03:57,057 --> 00:04:00,070
You want to tell us now, or are we
waiting for four wet bridesmaids?

54
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,798
Oh, God! Well, it started about
a half-hour before the wedding.

55
00:04:07,417 --> 00:04:09,236
I was in this room with
all the presents...

56
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:14,566
This really gorgeous
Limoges gravy boat.

57
00:04:15,194 --> 00:04:15,790
When all of a sudden I realize...

58
00:04:17,042 --> 00:04:17,317
Sweet 'N Low?

59
00:04:17,655 --> 00:04:19,982
I realized...

60
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:21,640
...I was more turned on by
this gravy boat than by Barry.

61
00:04:22,244 --> 00:04:24,385
And then I really freaked out,
when it hit me:

62
00:04:25,386 --> 00:04:27,905
How much Barry looks like
Mr. Potato Head.

63
00:04:29,371 --> 00:04:30,782
I always knew he looked
familiar, but. . . .

64
00:04:34,246 --> 00:04:37,958
I had to get out of there,
and I started wondering. . .

65
00:04:38,422 --> 00:04:39,925
. . . ''Why am I doing this?''
and ''Who am I doing this for?''

66
00:04:41,316 --> 00:04:44,943
I didn't know where to go, and I know
you and I have drifted apart. . .

67
00:04:45,971 --> 00:04:48,244
. . .but you're the only person
I know in the city.

68
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,462
Who wasn't asked to the wedding.

69
00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:52,802
I was kind of hoping that
wouldn't be an issue.

70
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,326
I guess he bought her
the pipe organ. . .

71
00:05:09,917 --> 00:05:11,066
. . .and she's really not
happy about it.

72
00:05:13,491 --> 00:05:16,842
Daddy, I just--
I can't marry him.

73
00:05:17,156 --> 00:05:17,980
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:18,587 --> 00:05:19,624
I just don't love him.

75
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:22,995
Well, it matters to me!

76
00:05:26,431 --> 00:05:28,894
She should not be
wearing those pants.

77
00:05:29,357 --> 00:05:31,597
I say push her down the stairs!

78
00:05:32,446 --> 00:05:35,784
Push her down the stairs!
Push her down the stairs!

79
00:05:38,822 --> 00:05:41,631
Come on, Daddy, listen!

80
00:05:41,881 --> 00:05:44,653
All my life, everyone's
always told me, ''You're a shoe! ''

81
00:05:45,663 --> 00:05:47,650
''You're a shoe! You're a shoe!
You're a shoe! ''

82
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:50,738
I stopped and said,
''What if I don't wanna be a shoe?

83
00:05:51,425 --> 00:05:54,023
What if I want to be a purse?

84
00:05:54,435 --> 00:05:55,555
Or a hat?''

85
00:05:57,201 --> 00:05:59,585
I don't want you to buy me a hat,
I--

86
00:05:59,914 --> 00:06:00,984
It's a metaphor, Daddy!

87
00:06:03,037 --> 00:06:04,803
You can see where he'd have trouble.

88
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,087
Look, Daddy, it's my life.

89
00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:13,646
Well, maybe I'll just stay
here with Monica.

90
00:06:16,515 --> 00:06:18,998
I guess we've established
she's staying with Monica.

91
00:06:21,043 --> 00:06:22,767
Well, maybe that's my decision.

92
00:06:24,153 --> 00:06:25,901
Well, maybe I don't need your money.

93
00:06:26,774 --> 00:06:28,137
Wait! Wait! I said maybe!

94
00:06:36,142 --> 00:06:37,313
Just breathe.
Breathe, that's it.

95
00:06:37,944 --> 00:06:39,753
Just try to think
of nice, calm things.

96
00:06:40,437 --> 00:06:42,149
Raindrops on roses
And whiskers on kittens

97
00:06:42,947 --> 00:06:44,979
Doorbells and sleigh bells
And something with mittens

98
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,101
La la la something
And noodles with string

99
00:06:53,005 --> 00:06:53,428
-These are a--
-I'm all better now.

100
00:06:55,976 --> 00:06:56,853
I helped.

101
00:06:59,645 --> 00:07:01,352
This is probably for
the best, you know?

102
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:03,923
Independence.
Taking control of your life.

103
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:08,304
If you need anything,
you can always come to Joey.

104
00:07:08,975 --> 00:07:11,986
Me and Chandler live across the hall.
And he's away a lot.

105
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:16,229
Joey, stop hitting on her!
It's her wedding day.

106
00:07:17,017 --> 00:07:18,327
What? Like there's
a rule or something?

107
00:07:21,031 --> 00:07:23,354
Please don't do that again.
It's a horrible sound.

108
00:07:24,543 --> 00:07:25,961
It's Paul.

109
00:07:26,424 --> 00:07:27,284
Buzz him in.

110
00:07:27,623 --> 00:07:28,022
-Who's Paul?
-Paul, the wine guy?

111
00:07:28,985 --> 00:07:30,328
Maybe.

112
00:07:30,749 --> 00:07:33,736
Your ''not a real date,''
is with Paul, the wine guy?

113
00:07:34,107 --> 00:07:35,155
He finally asked you out?

114
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:37,381
It's a ''Dear Diary'' moment.

115
00:07:39,273 --> 00:07:41,410
Rach, I can cancel.

116
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:42,742
Oh, God. Please, no.
Go, I'll be fine.

117
00:07:43,036 --> 00:07:44,959
Ross are you okay?
Do you want me to stay?

118
00:07:46,502 --> 00:07:47,859
That'd be good.

119
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:52,003
-Really?
-Go on! It's Paul, the wine guy!

120
00:07:56,221 --> 00:07:58,600
Hi, come in! Paul, this is. . .

121
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:02,222
. . .everybody.
Everybody, this is Paul.

122
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,285
-The wine guy.
-I didn't catch your name. Paul?

123
00:08:08,545 --> 00:08:09,760
Change. Sit down.
Two seconds.

124
00:08:13,944 --> 00:08:16,840
I just pulled out four eyelashes.
That can't be good.

125
00:08:19,784 --> 00:08:21,561
Rachel, what are you
up to tonight?

126
00:08:22,398 --> 00:08:26,213
I was supposed to be headed
for Aruba on my honeymoon. . .

127
00:08:26,556 --> 00:08:27,946
. . .so, nothing.

128
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,398
Right. You're not even
getting your honeymoon.

129
00:08:31,884 --> 00:08:36,537
Although, Aruba. This time of year?
Talk about your. . .

130
00:08:38,378 --> 00:08:39,526
. . .big lizards.

131
00:08:44,064 --> 00:08:46,085
If you don't feel
like being alone tonight. . .

132
00:08:46,812 --> 00:08:48,500
. . .Joey and Chandler are
helping me with my furniture.

133
00:08:49,723 --> 00:08:51,736
And we're very excited about it.

134
00:08:53,147 --> 00:08:56,837
Thanks. But I'm just gonna
hang out here.

135
00:08:57,387 --> 00:08:59,276
-It's been a long day.
-Okay. Sure.

136
00:08:59,562 --> 00:09:01,012
Pheebs, wanna help?

137
00:09:01,335 --> 00:09:02,061
I wish I could, but I don't want to.

138
00:09:09,897 --> 00:09:12,947
I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y
thing to the side things. . .

139
00:09:13,366 --> 00:09:16,419
. . .using a bunch of these
little worm guys.

140
00:09:17,995 --> 00:09:21,659
I have no bracket-y thing.
I see no worm guys whatsoever. . .

141
00:09:22,077 --> 00:09:25,801
. . .and I cannot feel my legs.

142
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:30,001
-Which goes where?
-I have no idea.

143
00:09:33,066 --> 00:09:34,663
-Done with the bookcase.
-All finished.

144
00:09:38,212 --> 00:09:40,409
This was Carol's favorite beer.

145
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:44,875
She always drank it out of the can.
I should have known.

146
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:48,011
Let me ask you a question.

147
00:09:48,315 --> 00:09:51,681
She got the furniture,
the stereo, the good TV.

148
00:09:52,572 --> 00:09:53,534
What did you get?

149
00:09:54,569 --> 00:09:55,392
You guys.

150
00:09:55,674 --> 00:09:56,971
-You got screwed.
-Oh, my God.

151
00:09:57,266 --> 00:10:00,550
-Oh, my God.
-I know. I'm such an idiot.

152
00:10:01,741 --> 00:10:05,630
I should've caught on when she went to
the dentist four and five times a week.

153
00:10:06,424 --> 00:10:08,017
I mean, how clean can teeth get?

154
00:10:08,526 --> 00:10:11,427
My brother's going through that.
He's a mess.

155
00:10:11,654 --> 00:10:12,411
How did you get through it?

156
00:10:12,608 --> 00:10:16,850
He might try accidentally breaking
something valuable of hers.

157
00:10:17,211 --> 00:10:18,206
-Say her--
-Leg?

158
00:10:18,403 --> 00:10:21,699
That's one way of going through it.
Me, I went for the watch.

159
00:10:22,051 --> 00:10:23,947
You actually broke her watch?

160
00:10:24,513 --> 00:10:27,482
Barry, I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.

161
00:10:28,091 --> 00:10:32,015
You probably think it's about making
love with your socks on, but it isn't.

162
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:34,730
It's about me.
And I just--

163
00:10:41,921 --> 00:10:43,830
Machine cut me off again.
Anyway. . . .

164
00:10:46,862 --> 00:10:50,868
You know what's scary? What if there
is only one woman for everybody?

165
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:53,556
I mean, what if you get one
woman, and that's it?

166
00:10:54,665 --> 00:10:58,420
Unfortunately, in my case,
there was only one woman for her.

167
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,784
What are you talking about?
One woman.

168
00:11:03,043 --> 00:11:05,802
That's like saying there's only
one flavor of ice cream for you.

169
00:11:07,104 --> 00:11:09,901
Let me tell you something.
There's lots of flavors out there.

170
00:11:10,388 --> 00:11:14,993
Rocky road, and cookie dough,
and bing cherry vanilla.

171
00:11:15,548 --> 00:11:18,537
You can get them with jimmies,
or nuts, or whipped cream.

172
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:22,109
This is the best thing that
ever happened to you!

173
00:11:22,729 --> 00:11:25,529
You got married. You were
like, what? Eight?

174
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:30,262
Welcome back to the world.
Grab a spoon!

175
00:11:31,543 --> 00:11:33,966
I honestly don't know
if I'm hungry or horny.

176
00:11:34,734 --> 00:11:35,972
Then stay out of my freezer.

177
00:11:39,146 --> 00:11:41,912
Ever since she
walked out on me, I. . . .

178
00:11:42,686 --> 00:11:46,098
What? What?

179
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:47,298
You wanna spell it out with noodles?

180
00:11:47,591 --> 00:11:50,244
It's more of a fifth date
kind of revelation.

181
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:53,706
So there's going to be a fifth date?

182
00:11:54,906 --> 00:11:56,093
Isn't there?

183
00:11:57,321 --> 00:11:58,812
Yeah, yeah. I think there is.

184
00:12:00,413 --> 00:12:01,804
What were you going to say?

185
00:12:04,255 --> 00:12:08,628
Ever since she left me. . .

186
00:12:10,561 --> 00:12:12,518
. . .I haven't been able to perform. . .

187
00:12:14,114 --> 00:12:14,936
. . .sexually.

188
00:12:17,918 --> 00:12:19,139
Oh, God! Oh, God!

189
00:12:19,487 --> 00:12:21,730
I'm so sorry.

190
00:12:21,931 --> 00:12:23,475
Being spit on is probably
not what you need right now.

191
00:12:26,945 --> 00:12:27,754
How long?

192
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:29,199
Two years.

193
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:34,253
I'm glad you smashed her watch.

194
00:12:36,143 --> 00:12:39,516
So you still think you might
want that fifth date?

195
00:12:42,038 --> 00:12:44,680
Yeah, I do.

196
00:12:52,081 --> 00:12:57,881
But Joanie loved Chachi.
That's the difference.

197
00:12:59,864 --> 00:13:01,869
''Grab a spoon. ''

198
00:13:02,317 --> 00:13:04,250
Do you know long it's been
since I grabbed a spoon?

199
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,480
Do the words, ''Billy, don't be a
hero,'' mean anything to you?

200
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:13,448
You know, here's the thing. Even if
I could get it together enough. . .

201
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,594
. . .to ask a woman out. . .

202
00:13:17,242 --> 00:13:18,390
. . .who am I going to ask?

203
00:13:39,768 --> 00:13:40,304
Isn't this amazing?

204
00:13:40,876 --> 00:13:43,088
I have never made coffee
before in my life.

205
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,858
-That is amazing.
-Congratulations.

206
00:13:46,306 --> 00:13:49,396
If you feel like you gotta make
a Western omelet or something. . . .

207
00:13:53,221 --> 00:13:55,532
Although, actually
I'm really not that hungry.

208
00:13:57,896 --> 00:13:59,024
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

209
00:14:01,512 --> 00:14:03,512
-Morning.
-Morning, Paul.

210
00:14:04,038 --> 00:14:06,042
-Hello, Paul.
-Hi. Paul, is it?

211
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,195
Last night was like. . .

212
00:14:13,242 --> 00:14:14,978
-Thank you so much.

213
00:14:16,116 --> 00:14:17,232
We'll talk later.

214
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:24,139
Thank you.

215
00:14:30,713 --> 00:14:32,045
That wasn't a real date.

216
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:35,728
What the hell do you do
on a real date?

217
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:39,092
Shut up and put my table back.

218
00:14:41,104 --> 00:14:42,749
I've got to get to work.

219
00:14:43,294 --> 00:14:46,964
If I don't input those numbers,
it doesn't make much of a difference.

220
00:14:51,321 --> 00:14:53,279
So, like, you guys all have jobs?

221
00:14:54,122 --> 00:14:55,550
Yeah, we all have jobs.

222
00:14:56,266 --> 00:14:58,109
That's how we buy stuff.

223
00:14:59,755 --> 00:15:00,775
Yeah, I'm an actor.

224
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,988
Have I seen you in anything?

225
00:15:04,309 --> 00:15:05,993
I doubt it.
Mostly regional work.

226
00:15:06,348 --> 00:15:09,504
Unless you happen to catch the
Wee One's production of Pinocchio...

227
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:12,222
''Look, Geppeto. I'm a real live boy. ''

228
00:15:15,011 --> 00:15:16,654
I will not take this abuse.

229
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,469
You're right. I'm sorry..

230
00:15:19,277 --> 00:15:21,395
Once I was a wooden boy
A little wooden boy

231
00:15:25,823 --> 00:15:28,274
How are you doing today?
You sleep okay?

232
00:15:28,712 --> 00:15:30,661
Did you talk to Barry?
I can't stop smiling.

233
00:15:31,946 --> 00:15:34,717
I see that. You look like you
slept with a hanger in your mouth.

234
00:15:40,823 --> 00:15:42,746
I know. He's just so--

235
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,789
Remember you and Tony De Marco?

236
00:15:47,088 --> 00:15:48,916
Well, it's like that.
With feelings.

237
00:15:50,769 --> 00:15:52,490
-Are you in trouble!

238
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:57,877
I'm going to get up, go to work,
and not think about him all day.

239
00:15:59,722 --> 00:16:01,058
Or else I'm just going
to get up and go to work.

240
00:16:02,359 --> 00:16:04,030
-Wish me luck!
-What for?

241
00:16:04,442 --> 00:16:07,206
I'm gonna go get one
of those job things.

242
00:16:14,814 --> 00:16:17,222
-Hey, Monica.
-Hey, Franny. Welcome back.

243
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,368
How was Florida?

244
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,778
You had sex, didn't you?

245
00:16:21,421 --> 00:16:24,620
How do you do that?

246
00:16:24,844 --> 00:16:26,366
So, who?

247
00:16:26,867 --> 00:16:28,146
You know Paul?

248
00:16:28,797 --> 00:16:30,027
Paul, the wine guy?

249
00:16:30,828 --> 00:16:31,972
Yeah, I know Paul.

250
00:16:34,073 --> 00:16:36,567
You mean, you know Paul
like I know Paul?

251
00:16:37,174 --> 00:16:39,021
Are you kidding?
I take credit for Paul.

252
00:16:39,448 --> 00:16:42,699
Before me, there was no snap in his
turtle for two years.

253
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:47,716
Of course it was a line.

254
00:16:49,546 --> 00:16:51,419
Why? Why would anybody
do something like that?

255
00:16:51,995 --> 00:16:54,627
We're looking for an answer
more sophisticated than. . .

256
00:16:55,144 --> 00:16:56,306
. . . ''To get you into bed. ''

257
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,419
Is it me?

258
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:03,329
Is it like I have some sort of
beacon that only dogs. . .

259
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,278
. . .and men with emotional
problems can hear?

260
00:17:06,184 --> 00:17:07,670
Come here.
Give me your feet.

261
00:17:14,979 --> 00:17:16,813
I just thought he was
nice, you know?

262
00:17:19,149 --> 00:17:21,998
I can't believe you
didn't know it was a line.

263
00:17:26,624 --> 00:17:27,361
Guess what?

264
00:17:27,786 --> 00:17:29,295
-You got a job?
-Are you kidding?

265
00:17:29,584 --> 00:17:31,019
I'm trained for nothing.

266
00:17:33,147 --> 00:17:34,381
I was laughed out of 12 interviews.

267
00:17:35,504 --> 00:17:36,667
You're surprisingly upbeat.

268
00:17:36,953 --> 00:17:39,782
You would be too if you found
Joan and David boots on sale. . .

269
00:17:40,421 --> 00:17:41,423
. . .50% percent off.

270
00:17:42,244 --> 00:17:44,375
How well you know me.

271
00:17:45,637 --> 00:17:47,897
They're my, ''I don't need
a job or my parents.

272
00:17:48,207 --> 00:17:49,535
I've got great boots,'' boots.

273
00:17:51,286 --> 00:17:53,406
-How did you pay for them?
-Credit card.

274
00:17:54,194 --> 00:17:55,422
And who pays for that?

275
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:58,090
My father.

276
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:02,527
You can't live off your parents.

277
00:18:02,932 --> 00:18:05,763
I know that. That's why
I was getting married.

278
00:18:06,782 --> 00:18:09,368
Give her a break. It's hard being
on your own for the first time.

279
00:18:09,802 --> 00:18:11,434
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

280
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,015
When I first came to
this city, I was 1 4.

281
00:18:14,244 --> 00:18:16,505
My mom had killed herself
and my stepdad was in prison.

282
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,123
And I got here,
and I didn't know anybody.

283
00:18:19,544 --> 00:18:23,853
I ended up living with this albino
guy who was cleaning windshields.

284
00:18:24,031 --> 00:18:27,517
And then he killed himself.

285
00:18:27,886 --> 00:18:31,378
Then I found aromatherapy. Believe
me, I know exactly how you feel.

286
00:18:34,885 --> 00:18:36,265
The word you're looking for is:

287
00:18:37,849 --> 00:18:39,518
''Anyway. . . . ''

288
00:18:43,241 --> 00:18:44,614
You ready?

289
00:18:44,887 --> 00:18:45,939
-I don't think so.

290
00:18:46,117 --> 00:18:51,271
Cut, cut, cut.

291
00:18:54,782 --> 00:18:56,901
Welcome to the real world!

292
00:18:57,301 --> 00:18:58,994
It sucks.
You're gonna love it.

293
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,381
That's it.

294
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:10,001
You gonna crash on the couch?

295
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,882
-No, I gotta go home sometime.
-Are you gonna be okay?

296
00:19:15,543 --> 00:19:17,486
Look what I just
found on the floor.

297
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,623
What?

298
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:22,745
That's Paul's watch.

299
00:19:23,403 --> 00:19:25,030
You can just put it back
where you found it.

300
00:19:26,783 --> 00:19:28,166
Oh, boy! All right.

301
00:19:29,343 --> 00:19:30,379
-Good night, everybody.
-Good night.

302
00:19:41,745 --> 00:19:43,013
-I'm sorry.
-No!

303
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,382
-No, have it, really.
-Split it?

304
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:53,573
You probably didn't know this,
but back in high school I had. . .

305
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:55,556
. . .a major crush on you.

306
00:19:57,594 --> 00:19:58,516
I knew.

307
00:19:59,111 --> 00:19:59,994
You did?

308
00:20:01,796 --> 00:20:04,545
I figured you thought I was
Monica's geeky older brother.

309
00:20:05,629 --> 00:20:06,248
I did.

310
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,825
Listen, do you think--

311
00:20:13,464 --> 00:20:16,995
And try not to let my vulnerability
become any kind of a factor here.

312
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:20,331
Do you think it would be okay if
I asked you out sometime, maybe?

313
00:20:25,862 --> 00:20:26,817
Maybe.

314
00:20:34,888 --> 00:20:36,006
Okay, maybe I will.

315
00:20:40,574 --> 00:20:41,798
-Good night.
-Good night.

316
00:20:56,081 --> 00:20:57,081
See you.

317
00:20:59,063 --> 00:20:59,999
Wait, wait.

318
00:21:00,611 --> 00:21:01,762
What's with you?

319
00:21:03,698 --> 00:21:05,335
I just grabbed a spoon.

320
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:15,745
I can't believe what
I'm hearing.

321
00:21:16,022 --> 00:21:17,379
I can't believe what
I'm hearing.

322
00:21:17,751 --> 00:21:19,518
-What? I said you had--
-What? I said you had--

323
00:21:20,845 --> 00:21:21,705
Would you stop?

324
00:21:22,429 --> 00:21:23,452
Was I doing it again?

325
00:21:25,752 --> 00:21:27,297
Would anybody like more coffee?

326
00:21:30,057 --> 00:21:31,663
Did you make it?

327
00:21:32,105 --> 00:21:34,725
-I'm just serving it.
-I'll have a cup of coffee.

328
00:21:35,832 --> 00:21:37,425
Kids, new dream.

329
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:40,271
I'm in Las Vegas.
I'm Liza Minnelli.
