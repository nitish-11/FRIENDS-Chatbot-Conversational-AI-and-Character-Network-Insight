1
00:00:00,301 --> 00:00:02,940
Do you think they have
yesterday's Daily News?

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:06,330
I just wanna check my horoscope,
see if it was right.

3
00:00:07,576 --> 00:00:11,125
Oh, my God! Don't look now.
Behind you there's a guy. . .

4
00:00:11,373 --> 00:00:14,046
. . .who can break our hearts
and plunge us into depression.

5
00:00:14,291 --> 00:00:15,246
Where?

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:18,282
Come to Mama!

7
00:00:18,888 --> 00:00:21,197
He's coming!
Be cool! Be cool! Be cool!

8
00:00:21,486 --> 00:00:23,602
-Nice hat.
-Thanks.

9
00:00:24,204 --> 00:00:26,672
-We should do something. Whistle.
-We're not whistling.

10
00:00:26,883 --> 00:00:27,713
Come on, do it!

11
00:00:27,922 --> 00:00:30,117
Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

12
00:00:35,357 --> 00:00:37,587
I can't believe you did that!

13
00:00:38,514 --> 00:00:40,550
The One With Mrs. Bing

14
00:00:41,832 --> 00:00:42,821
English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

15
00:01:24,443 --> 00:01:26,035
Why did I woo-hoo?

16
00:01:26,241 --> 00:01:28,391
Was I hoping he'd turn around and say. . .

17
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,790
. . . ''I love that sound.
I must have you now''?

18
00:01:32,317 --> 00:01:35,070
I just wish there was something
we could do.

19
00:01:37,554 --> 00:01:38,703
Hello, coma guy.

20
00:01:40,472 --> 00:01:42,383
Get up, you Girl Scout!
Up, up, up!

21
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,779
What are you doing?

22
00:01:44,029 --> 00:01:45,860
Maybe nobody's tried this.

23
00:01:48,546 --> 00:01:50,855
I wish we at least knew his name.

24
00:01:51,064 --> 00:01:52,656
Look at that face.

25
00:01:52,943 --> 00:01:56,697
I mean, even sleeping he looks smart.
I bet he's a lawyer.

26
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,216
Yeah, but the dents in his knuckles
mean he's artistic.

27
00:02:00,697 --> 00:02:04,690
Okay. He's a lawyer who teaches
sculpting on the side.

28
00:02:04,935 --> 00:02:06,414
And he can dance!

29
00:02:07,133 --> 00:02:11,251
And he's the kind of guy who,
when you're talking, he's listening. . .

30
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,088
. . .not saying, ''I understand'' . . .

31
00:02:13,329 --> 00:02:15,843
. . .but really wondering
what you look like naked.

32
00:02:18,685 --> 00:02:21,199
I wish all guys could be like him.

33
00:02:22,882 --> 00:02:23,871
I know.

34
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:31,631
Are there no conscious men
in the city for you two?

35
00:02:32,475 --> 00:02:33,669
He doesn't have anyone.

36
00:02:33,914 --> 00:02:35,950
We feel kind of responsible.

37
00:02:36,633 --> 00:02:39,022
I can't believe you said, ''Woo-hoo! ''

38
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,063
I don't even say, ''Woo-hoo! ''

39
00:02:41,309 --> 00:02:42,822
Oh, she's coming up!

40
00:02:43,068 --> 00:02:47,539
When we come back, we'll talk with
the always-interesting Nora Tyler Bing!

41
00:02:47,785 --> 00:02:49,741
Put the kids to bed for this one.

42
00:02:49,983 --> 00:02:53,419
Don't watch this. Weekend at Bernie's
is on Showtime and HBO!

43
00:02:53,661 --> 00:02:54,537
No way!

44
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,493
Come on! She's your mom!

45
00:02:56,739 --> 00:02:58,536
Exactly. Weekend at Bernie's.

46
00:02:58,777 --> 00:03:01,371
Dead guy getting hit
in the groin 20, 30 times.

47
00:03:03,414 --> 00:03:06,451
I gotta tell you, I love
your mom's books! I love them!

48
00:03:06,692 --> 00:03:09,252
I cannot get on a plane without one.
This is so cool!

49
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,799
You wouldn't think it's cool
if you were 1 1 . . .

50
00:03:12,008 --> 00:03:15,967
. . .and your friends were passing around
page 79 of Mistress Bitch.

51
00:03:16,565 --> 00:03:18,681
I love your mom!
I think she's a blast!

52
00:03:18,923 --> 00:03:20,675
You can say that.
She's not your mom.

53
00:03:20,922 --> 00:03:22,196
Oh, please! She's the--

54
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:24,119
Hi, sweetie!

55
00:03:25,918 --> 00:03:28,591
When did ''Rigatoni'' get back from Rome?

56
00:03:29,996 --> 00:03:31,224
-Last night.
-Really?

57
00:03:31,474 --> 00:03:34,591
So then his plane didn't explode
in a big ball of fire?

58
00:03:34,832 --> 00:03:36,629
Just a dream I had.

59
00:03:36,991 --> 00:03:38,026
But. . . .

60
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:40,577
Hey, hey, hey! She's on!

61
00:03:43,586 --> 00:03:45,065
Nora Bing!

62
00:03:46,504 --> 00:03:50,816
Back to the book. What is this
about you being arrested in London?

63
00:03:51,181 --> 00:03:52,739
Your mom was arrested?

64
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,851
I'm busy beaming with pride.

65
00:03:55,618 --> 00:03:57,336
This is kind of embarrassing...

66
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:01,533
...but occasionally after
I've been intimate with a man...

67
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:04,128
Why would she say that's embarrassing?

68
00:04:05,131 --> 00:04:08,248
...I just get this craving
for Kung Pao chicken.

69
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:10,480
That's too much information!

70
00:04:14,165 --> 00:04:16,804
So now you're doing this book tour.
How's that going?

71
00:04:17,043 --> 00:04:20,877
Oh, fine. I'm leaving
for New York tomorrow, which I hate.

72
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,190
But I get to see my son, who I love!

73
00:04:24,997 --> 00:04:28,546
This is the way that I find out.
Most moms use the phone.

74
00:04:28,955 --> 00:04:32,709
Don 't take this wrong, I just
don 't see you as a mom somehow.

75
00:04:32,912 --> 00:04:36,666
-I don 't mean that bad.
-Oh, no. I'm a fabulous mom!

76
00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:39,140
I bought my son his first condoms.

77
00:04:44,944 --> 00:04:47,174
And then he burst into flames.

78
00:04:55,816 --> 00:04:59,729
Let's see. ''Congress is debating
a new deficit-reduction bill.

79
00:04:59,973 --> 00:05:02,009
The mayor wants to raise subway fares.

80
00:05:02,531 --> 00:05:04,647
The high today was 45. ''

81
00:05:05,609 --> 00:05:06,883
Teams played sports.

82
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,509
What about Glen?

83
00:05:34,869 --> 00:05:35,984
He could be a Glen.

84
00:05:36,228 --> 00:05:38,025
Not special enough.

85
00:05:38,586 --> 00:05:40,338
How about Agamemnon?

86
00:05:40,865 --> 00:05:42,184
Way too special.

87
00:05:50,698 --> 00:05:52,893
I'm famished. What do I want?

88
00:05:53,136 --> 00:05:56,208
Please, God, don't let it be
Kung Pao chicken.

89
00:05:56,494 --> 00:05:59,167
You watched the show!
What did you think?

90
00:05:59,412 --> 00:06:01,767
I think you need to come out
of your shell.

91
00:06:04,688 --> 00:06:06,201
What is this dive?

92
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:08,683
Only you could've picked this place.

93
00:06:09,365 --> 00:06:12,323
Come on. Shut up. It's fun.
Give me a hug.

94
00:06:13,442 --> 00:06:16,115
-I think we're ready for some tequila.
-I know I am.

95
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,271
-Who's doing shots?
-Hit me.

96
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:19,594
There you go. Ross?

97
00:06:20,117 --> 00:06:22,551
I'm not really a shot-drinking
kind of guy.

98
00:06:22,756 --> 00:06:24,314
Hi! Sorry we're late.

99
00:06:24,554 --> 00:06:27,910
We kind of just, you know,
lost track of time.

100
00:06:30,071 --> 00:06:31,902
But a man can change.

101
00:06:37,425 --> 00:06:39,893
Anyone want me to appraise anything?

102
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:52,575
Mrs. Bing, I've read
everything you've ever written.

103
00:06:52,815 --> 00:06:56,854
When I read Euphoria at Midnight,
all I wanted to do was become a writer.

104
00:06:57,092 --> 00:06:59,765
Oh, please, honey.
If I can do it, anybody can.

105
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,246
Start with half a dozen
European cities. . .

106
00:07:02,448 --> 00:07:05,042
. . .throw in 30 euphemisms
for male genitalia. . .

107
00:07:05,286 --> 00:07:07,561
. . .and you have got yourself a book!

108
00:07:08,844 --> 00:07:11,278
My mother, ladies and gentlemen!

109
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,919
Yeah, any messages for room 226?

110
00:07:18,437 --> 00:07:21,395
-You okay, slugger?
-Oh, yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine.

111
00:07:33,626 --> 00:07:35,218
What is with you tonight?

112
00:07:35,425 --> 00:07:37,939
Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.

113
00:07:38,703 --> 00:07:40,022
Okay, thank you.

114
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,773
It's the Italian hand-licker, isn't it?

115
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:48,407
No. It's the one he's licking.

116
00:07:49,455 --> 00:07:51,173
She's supposed to be with you.

117
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:53,163
You're good.

118
00:07:54,092 --> 00:07:58,722
I have sold 100 million copies
of my books, and you know why?

119
00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:02,001
The girl on the cover
with her nipples showing?

120
00:08:03,885 --> 00:08:08,675
No, because I know how to write men
that women fall in love with.

121
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,719
Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo.

122
00:08:10,961 --> 00:08:13,998
People will not turn 325 pages
for a Paolo.

123
00:08:14,198 --> 00:08:17,235
Come on. The guy's
a secondary character.

124
00:08:17,476 --> 00:08:20,593
He's just a complication
you eventually kill off.

125
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,027
When?

126
00:08:25,191 --> 00:08:27,341
He's not a hero.

127
00:08:28,269 --> 00:08:29,588
You know who our hero is?

128
00:08:29,867 --> 00:08:32,335
The guy on the cover
with his nipples showing?

129
00:08:32,985 --> 00:08:34,384
No, it's you.

130
00:08:34,624 --> 00:08:36,023
-Please.
-No, really.

131
00:08:36,263 --> 00:08:38,538
Come on. You're smart. You're sexy.

132
00:08:39,261 --> 00:08:40,819
-Right.
-Come on, kiddo.

133
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,779
You're gonna be fine, believe me.

134
00:09:02,565 --> 00:09:04,476
I'll just pee in the street.

135
00:09:15,116 --> 00:09:15,992
Is Chandler here?

136
00:09:16,595 --> 00:09:17,789
Wait. Come here.

137
00:09:19,233 --> 00:09:21,463
Okay, about last night. . .

138
00:09:21,711 --> 00:09:22,541
. . .you know. . .

139
00:09:22,751 --> 00:09:24,628
. . .Chandler, you didn't tell. . . .

140
00:09:24,869 --> 00:09:29,067
We don't need to tell Chandler.
It was just a kiss. No big deal, right?

141
00:09:29,306 --> 00:09:31,058
Right. No big deal.

142
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:32,897
In Bizarro-world!

143
00:09:36,181 --> 00:09:37,330
You broke the code!

144
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:40,339
-What code?
-You don't kiss your friend's mom.

145
00:09:40,578 --> 00:09:43,934
Sisters are okay.
Maybe a hot-looking aunt.

146
00:09:44,136 --> 00:09:46,445
But not a mom. Never a mom!

147
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:51,049
What are you guys doing out here?

148
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:54,727
Joey and I had discussed getting
in an early morning racquetball game.

149
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:59,040
But apparently somebody overslept.

150
00:10:00,884 --> 00:10:02,761
Yeah, well, you don't have your racquet.

151
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:05,563
No. No, I don't
because it's being restrung.

152
00:10:05,801 --> 00:10:07,837
Somebody was supposed to bring me one.

153
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:11,912
Well, you didn't call
and leave your grip size.

154
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,908
You guys are spending
way too much time together.

155
00:10:19,751 --> 00:10:21,184
I'm scum. I'm scum.

156
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:23,739
-How could you let this happen?
-I don't know.

157
00:10:23,988 --> 00:10:25,819
It's not like she's a regular mom.

158
00:10:26,067 --> 00:10:27,705
She's sexy. She's. . . .

159
00:10:27,946 --> 00:10:30,096
You don't think my mom's sexy?

160
00:10:31,343 --> 00:10:33,777
Well, not in the same way.

161
00:10:34,021 --> 00:10:37,900
I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani
was a handsome woman in her day.

162
00:10:39,178 --> 00:10:42,488
You think it's easy giving birth
to seven children?

163
00:10:44,254 --> 00:10:47,212
Okay, I think we're getting
into a weird area here.

164
00:10:49,451 --> 00:10:50,725
What are you doing here?

165
00:10:52,249 --> 00:10:53,921
Not playing racquetball.

166
00:10:56,046 --> 00:11:00,005
-He forgot to leave his grip size.
-He didn't get the goggles.

167
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:04,351
Sounds like you two have issues.

168
00:11:07,358 --> 00:11:08,427
Goodbye, baby.

169
00:11:10,756 --> 00:11:12,951
Do they wait for me to do this?

170
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,742
-Are you gonna tell him?
-Why would I tell him?

171
00:11:21,988 --> 00:11:24,297
How about, because if you don't,
his mother might?

172
00:11:25,586 --> 00:11:27,861
What are you guys doing here?

173
00:11:28,344 --> 00:11:30,619
He's not even wearing a jock strap!

174
00:11:36,058 --> 00:11:37,889
What did I ask?

175
00:11:51,727 --> 00:11:53,285
What are you doing here?

176
00:11:53,486 --> 00:11:56,478
Nothing. I just thought
I'd stop by, you know, after. . .

177
00:11:56,724 --> 00:11:57,873
. . .that I, you know.

178
00:11:58,123 --> 00:11:59,841
So what are you doing here?

179
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:02,633
I'm not really here.

180
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,197
I just thought I'd drop these off
on the way. My way.

181
00:12:09,515 --> 00:12:12,234
Do you come here a lot. . .

182
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:14,148
. . .without me?

183
00:12:14,392 --> 00:12:16,428
No, no, no.

184
00:12:19,588 --> 00:12:22,785
Do you think he's doing any better
than he was this morning?

185
00:12:24,305 --> 00:12:26,694
How would I know? I wasn't here.

186
00:12:26,943 --> 00:12:30,219
Really? Not even
to change his pajamas?

187
00:12:33,978 --> 00:12:34,854
Oh, my God!

188
00:12:35,097 --> 00:12:37,736
You're my friend.
I had to tell you.

189
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,573
I can't believe it.

190
00:12:40,613 --> 00:12:41,807
Paolo kissed my mom?

191
00:12:43,292 --> 00:12:46,204
I don't know if you noticed,
but he had a lot to drink.

192
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:48,963
I mean, you know how he gets
when he's drunk--

193
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:52,563
I can't do this. I did it.

194
00:12:52,765 --> 00:12:55,120
It was me. I'm sorry.
I kissed your mom.

195
00:12:55,643 --> 00:12:56,553
What?

196
00:12:57,082 --> 00:13:01,394
I was upset about Rachel and Paolo
and I had too much tequila, and Nora. . .

197
00:13:01,599 --> 00:13:03,590
. . .Mrs. Mom, your Bing, was. . .

198
00:13:05,476 --> 00:13:07,706
. . .just being nice.
But nothing happened.

199
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:09,024
Nothing. Ask Joey.

200
00:13:09,394 --> 00:13:10,224
Joey came in--

201
00:13:10,473 --> 00:13:12,191
You knew about this?

202
00:13:12,431 --> 00:13:14,581
You know, knowledge is a tricky thing.

203
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:18,104
I spent the entire day with you.
Why didn't you tell me?

204
00:13:18,347 --> 00:13:21,976
You're lucky I caught them, or else
who knows what would've happened?

205
00:13:22,185 --> 00:13:23,538
Thanks, man. Big help.

206
00:13:24,223 --> 00:13:26,259
I can't believe this!
What were you thinking?

207
00:13:26,502 --> 00:13:28,493
I wasn't. I don't know. I--

208
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,817
No one knows the crap I go through
with my mom more than you.

209
00:13:32,058 --> 00:13:34,208
-I know.
-I can't believe you did this!

210
00:13:34,456 --> 00:13:36,606
-Me neither.
-I'm mad at you for not telling me.

211
00:13:36,854 --> 00:13:39,493
-What are you mad at me--?
-Let me slam the door!

212
00:13:40,572 --> 00:13:44,611
I didn't kiss her. He did. See
what happens when you break the code?

213
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,352
''A Woman Undone.
By Rachel Karen Greene. ''

214
00:14:00,558 --> 00:14:03,755
I thought I'd give it a shot.
I'm on the first chapter.

215
00:14:03,996 --> 00:14:08,751
Do you think his ''love stick'' can be
''liberated from its denim prison''?

216
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,461
Yeah, I'd say so.

217
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,862
And there's no ''j'' in ''engorged. ''

218
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,182
Hey, Rach.

219
00:14:21,104 --> 00:14:23,572
-You going to the hospital tonight?
-No. You?

220
00:14:24,022 --> 00:14:25,375
No. You?

221
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:28,888
You just asked me.

222
00:14:29,818 --> 00:14:31,854
Maybe it was a trick question.

223
00:14:33,615 --> 00:14:35,845
Rachel, can we do this now?

224
00:14:37,572 --> 00:14:39,449
I am so hot!

225
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,922
Here's my mother and father
on their wedding day.

226
00:14:44,168 --> 00:14:47,046
Now, you tell me she's not a knockout.

227
00:14:48,405 --> 00:14:50,202
I cannot believe this conversation.

228
00:14:50,443 --> 00:14:52,877
Just try to picture her not pregnant.

229
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,351
Central Perk is proud to present
Miss Phoebe Buffay.

230
00:15:00,397 --> 00:15:01,227
Thanks.

231
00:15:03,514 --> 00:15:06,551
I'd like to start with a song
about a man I recently met. . .

232
00:15:06,792 --> 00:15:09,909
. . .who's come to be
very important to me.

233
00:15:15,986 --> 00:15:19,535
You don 't have to be awake
To be my man

234
00:15:21,662 --> 00:15:26,417
Long as you have brain waves
I'll be there to hold your hand

235
00:15:27,857 --> 00:15:29,927
Though we just met the other day

236
00:15:30,176 --> 00:15:33,486
There's something I have got to say

237
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:37,411
Thank you very much.
I'm gonna take a short break.

238
00:15:39,729 --> 00:15:43,119
Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody.

239
00:15:44,286 --> 00:15:46,880
-What the hell was that?
-Phoebe just started--

240
00:15:47,124 --> 00:15:50,480
I was talking to Joey.
All right, there, mother-kisser?

241
00:15:55,718 --> 00:15:57,231
''Mother-kisser. ''

242
00:15:58,676 --> 00:15:59,825
I'll shut up.

243
00:16:00,155 --> 00:16:02,464
Chandler, I know
you're still mad at me. . .

244
00:16:02,713 --> 00:16:05,386
. . .but there were two people
there that night.

245
00:16:05,951 --> 00:16:08,829
-There were two sets of lips.
-I expect this from her.

246
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:11,624
She's always been a Freudian nightmare.

247
00:16:11,827 --> 00:16:14,785
If she always behaves like this,
why don't you say something?

248
00:16:15,025 --> 00:16:17,903
Because it's complicated.
It's complex!

249
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,542
Hey, you kissed my mom!

250
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,330
We're rehearsing a Greek play.

251
00:16:26,817 --> 00:16:28,455
That's funny.
Are we done now?

252
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:31,727
You mean you're not gonna
tell her how you feel?

253
00:16:31,973 --> 00:16:35,045
No. Just because you played
tonsil tennis with my mom. . .

254
00:16:35,251 --> 00:16:38,288
. . .doesn't mean you know her.
Trust me, you can't talk to her.

255
00:16:38,528 --> 00:16:40,723
Okay. ''You can't''?
Or you can't?

256
00:16:42,006 --> 00:16:43,405
Okay, that's my finger.

257
00:16:43,605 --> 00:16:46,039
Okay, that's my knee.

258
00:16:46,323 --> 00:16:47,676
Still doing the play.

259
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,429
What did you do with him?

260
00:17:01,512 --> 00:17:03,264
-You're awake!
-Look at you!

261
00:17:03,511 --> 00:17:05,422
How do you feel?

262
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,621
A little woozy, but basically okay.

263
00:17:07,828 --> 00:17:09,625
Gosh, you look good!

264
00:17:09,867 --> 00:17:11,186
I feel good.

265
00:17:12,425 --> 00:17:13,778
Who are you?

266
00:17:14,064 --> 00:17:15,543
-Sorry.
-I'm Phoebe Buffay.

267
00:17:15,783 --> 00:17:18,251
I'm Monica Geller.
I've been taking care of you.

268
00:17:18,501 --> 00:17:19,331
We both have.

269
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,413
-The Etch A Sketch is from you guys?
-Actually, from me.

270
00:17:22,658 --> 00:17:25,252
-I got you the foot massager.
-I shaved you.

271
00:17:25,496 --> 00:17:26,326
I read to you.

272
00:17:26,575 --> 00:17:27,644
I sang.

273
00:17:29,813 --> 00:17:31,132
Well, thanks.

274
00:17:31,372 --> 00:17:33,488
-Oh, my pleasure.
-You're welcome.

275
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,488
So I guess I'll see you around.

276
00:17:37,687 --> 00:17:39,359
What? That's it?

277
00:17:39,886 --> 00:17:41,444
''See you around''?

278
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:44,643
-What do you want me to say?
-I don't know.

279
00:17:44,882 --> 00:17:46,110
Maybe. . .

280
00:17:46,361 --> 00:17:47,589
. . . ''That was nice. ''

281
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,159
''It meant something to me. ''

282
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:51,758
''I'll call you. ''

283
00:17:52,837 --> 00:17:56,147
-All right. I'll call you.
-I don't think you mean that.

284
00:17:59,272 --> 00:18:01,024
This is so typical.

285
00:18:01,471 --> 00:18:02,586
You know, we give. . .

286
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,018
. . .and we give. . .

287
00:18:04,269 --> 00:18:05,782
. . .and we give.

288
00:18:05,988 --> 00:18:08,024
And then we just get nothing back.

289
00:18:08,266 --> 00:18:11,975
And then one day, it's just,
you wake up, and ''See you around. ''

290
00:18:14,142 --> 00:18:15,541
Let's go, Phoebe.

291
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,770
You know what?
We thought you were different.

292
00:18:20,977 --> 00:18:23,093
But I guess it was just the coma.

293
00:18:27,013 --> 00:18:30,847
The car's waiting. I just wanted
to drop off my book for your friends.

294
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:35,968
-Anything you want from Lisbon?
-Just knowing you're there is enough.

295
00:18:36,567 --> 00:18:39,639
All right. Well, be good.
I love you.

296
00:18:42,642 --> 00:18:44,155
You kissed my best Ross!

297
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,392
Or something to that effect.

298
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,111
Look, it was stupid.

299
00:18:57,312 --> 00:18:59,428
-Really stupid.
-Really stupid.

300
00:19:01,629 --> 00:19:03,938
And I don't even know how it happened.

301
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:07,697
I'm sorry, honey. I promise
it will never happen again.

302
00:19:09,624 --> 00:19:11,342
Are we okay now?

303
00:19:12,582 --> 00:19:13,776
No.

304
00:19:18,817 --> 00:19:21,854
The forbidden love
of a man and his door.

305
00:19:23,494 --> 00:19:26,611
He told her off. And not just
about the kiss, about everything!

306
00:19:26,852 --> 00:19:27,762
You're kidding?

307
00:19:28,011 --> 00:19:30,525
He said, ''When are you gonna
grow up and start being a mom?''

308
00:19:31,089 --> 00:19:32,647
Then she came back with. . .

309
00:19:32,887 --> 00:19:37,119
. . . ''The question is, when are you gonna
grow up and realize I have a bomb?''

310
00:19:39,123 --> 00:19:40,522
Are you sure she didn't say. . .

311
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:44,510
. . . ''When are you gonna grow up
and realize I am your mom?''

312
00:19:47,997 --> 00:19:49,316
That makes more sense.

313
00:19:49,556 --> 00:19:50,591
You think?

314
00:19:52,354 --> 00:19:53,343
What's going on now?

315
00:19:53,953 --> 00:19:57,150
I don't know. I've been standing here
spelling it out for you.

316
00:19:59,189 --> 00:20:00,941
I don't hear anything. Wait!

317
00:20:01,188 --> 00:20:02,143
What do you see?

318
00:20:02,387 --> 00:20:04,696
It's hard to tell.
They're tiny and upside down.

319
00:20:04,945 --> 00:20:06,173
Wait, wait, wait!

320
00:20:06,384 --> 00:20:09,376
They're walking away.
They're walking away.

321
00:20:09,982 --> 00:20:13,292
No, they're not. They're coming
right at us. Run, run!

322
00:20:15,738 --> 00:20:16,807
Are you okay, kiddo?

323
00:20:17,097 --> 00:20:18,132
Yeah, I'm okay.

324
00:20:18,376 --> 00:20:20,094
All right. You be good.

325
00:20:20,335 --> 00:20:21,893
Drive safe.

326
00:20:23,772 --> 00:20:25,967
-Mrs. Bing.
-Mr. Geller.

327
00:20:34,365 --> 00:20:35,878
You mean that?

328
00:20:36,523 --> 00:20:37,876
Yeah, why not?

329
00:20:40,161 --> 00:20:41,230
So I told her.

330
00:20:42,479 --> 00:20:44,310
-How did it go?
-Awful. Awful.

331
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:46,150
Couldn't have gone worse.

332
00:20:47,116 --> 00:20:48,708
Well, how do you feel?

333
00:20:48,955 --> 00:20:49,831
Pretty good.

334
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,107
I told her.

335
00:20:53,432 --> 00:20:55,104
Well, see?

336
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:59,468
So maybe it wasn't such a bad idea
me kissing your mom, huh?

337
00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:01,942
But we don't have to
go down that road.

338
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:10,857
This is just the first chapter. . .

339
00:21:11,099 --> 00:21:15,456
. . .and I want your absolute
honest opinion. Okay?

340
00:21:16,136 --> 00:21:20,015
And on page two, he's not reaching
for her ''heaving beasts. ''

341
00:21:21,532 --> 00:21:22,567
What's a ''niffle''?
