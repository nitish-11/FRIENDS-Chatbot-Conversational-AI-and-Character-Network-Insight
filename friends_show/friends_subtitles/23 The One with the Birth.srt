1
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,931
She's not here yet! She's having
my baby and she's not here!

2
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,892
It's fine.
Has her water broken yet?

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:11,896
I don't know.

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,052
She told me she'd already
passed the mucus plug.

5
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,371
Do we have to know about that?

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,612
What'll you do when
you have a baby?

7
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,296
I'm gonna be in the waiting room,
handing out cigars.

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,529
Joey's made arrangements to have
his baby in a movie from the '50s.

9
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,532
I don't believe this!
She could be giving birth in the cab!

10
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,937
Relax. It's only $2
for the first contraction. . .

11
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,252
. . .and then 50 cents for each
additional contraction.

12
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,689
What, it's okay
when Chandler does it?

13
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,578
You have to pick your moments.

14
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,414
-Did I miss it?
-She's not even here yet.

15
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:53,888
What's with the guitar?

16
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,053
I thought we might be here for a while.
Things might get musical.

17
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,052
-Where have you been?
-We stopped at the gift shop.

18
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,410
I wanted a stuffed animal.
Susan wanted a Chunky.

19
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,696
Susan wanted a--
You're having a baby!

20
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,658
You don't stop for Chunkies!

21
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,930
I used to have that bumper sticker.

22
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,329
You see what I mean?

23
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,578
The One With the Birth

Let it go, Ross.

27
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,896
I got an extra one.
You want this?

28
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:12,289
-How's my favorite parenting team?
-Dr. Franzblau. Hi.

29
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,293
I understand you're thinking
of having a baby.

30
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,334
I see you're nine months pregnant.
That's a good start.

31
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,408
How are your contractions?

32
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,374
I love them! Each one's
like a little party in my uterus!

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,337
They're every four minutes
and last 55 seconds.

34
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,616
59 seconds.
Quartz.

35
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,734
Swiss quartz.

36
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,498
Am I allowed to drink anything?

37
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,935
Ice chips.
They're at the nurse's station.

38
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,410
-I'II get them!
-No, I'm getting it!

39
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,694
Thought you might Like
some ice chips.

40
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,495
-Thanks.
-And if you need anything else, I. . .

41
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,417
. . .do not believe we have met.

42
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,219
I'm Rachel Greene.

43
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,611
I'm Carol’s ex-husband's
sister's roommate.

44
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,409
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Dr. Franzblau.

45
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,891
I'm your roommate's brother's
ex-wife's obstetrician.

46
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,293
Oh, that's funny!

47
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,498
I want a baby!

48
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,013
Not tonight, honey.
I got an early day tomorrow.

49
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,057
Get up. Come on,
let's get some coffee.

50
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,091
Okay, because we never do that.

51
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,494
Shoot, shoot, shoot!

52
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,336
Or just fall down.
That's good too.

53
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,295
Knick fan?

54
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,457
Oh, boy, do they suck!

55
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,610
Listen, lady--

56
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,056
Look!

57
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,495
Look at your man, Ewing.

58
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,931
Nice shot. He couldn’t hit water
if he was standing on a boat.

59
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,579
And who do you Like?

60
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,737
-Celtics.
-Celtics?

61
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,898
They couldn’t hit a boat if--

62
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:51,936
Wait. . . .

63
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,293
They suck, all right?

64
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,410
Shut up!
It's a rebuilding year--

65
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,729
Let me get the father!
We need a father over here!

66
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,732
There's no father.

67
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,290
Oh, sorry.

68
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,376
That's okay. I'm fine.

69
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,698
Okay. AII right.
Right this way.

70
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,892
AII the other pregnant women
seem to be going in here.

71
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,890
They're tiny and chubby
And so sweet to touch

72
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:31,655
But soon they'll grow up
And resent you so much

73
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,339
Now they're yelling at you
And you don't know why

74
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:41,334
And you cry and you cry
And you cry

75
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,538
And you cry and you cry
And you cry

76
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,816
-Thanks, Ross.
-I'm paying you to stop.

77
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,934
Oh, look, twins.
Hi, guys. Oh, cute.

78
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:55,936
No fair!

79
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,854
I don't even have one!
How come they get two?

80
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,215
You'll get one.

81
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,776
When?

82
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,695
Tell you what. When we're 40,
and if neither of us are married. . .

83
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,535
. . .what do you say
we have one together?

84
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,537
Why won't I be married
when I'm 40?

85
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,693
I just meant hypothetically.

86
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,773
''Hypothetically,'' why won't I be
married when I'm 40?

87
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,690
What is it? Is there something
unmarriable about me?

88
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,899
Well?

89
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:28,098
Dear God!
This parachute is a knapsack!

90
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,530
Look at you, dressy-dress.

91
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,493
Did you go home and change?

92
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,295
It's an important day.
I want to Look nice.

93
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,651
Has Dr. Franzblau been by. . .?

94
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,209
I haven't seen him.

95
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,094
Where is he?
He is supposed to be here.

96
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,211
What if the baby needs him?

97
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,496
What's the deal with you
and doctors?

98
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,099
Is your father a doctor?

99
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,133
Yeah. Why?

100
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,489
No reason.

101
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,530
Mom, we've been through this.

102
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,214
No, I am not calling him.

103
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,293
I don't care if it is his kid,
the guy's a jerk!

104
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:14,089
No, I am not alone.
Joey's here.

105
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,732
What do you mean, ''Joey who''?

106
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,095
Joey who?

107
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,298
-Tribbiani.
-Joey Tribbiani.

108
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,129
Hold on.

109
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,733
She wants to talk to you.

110
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,333
Take the phone!

111
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,899
Yeah, it's me.

112
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,451
We're just friends.

113
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,893
Yeah, I'm single.

114
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,928
Twenty-five.

115
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,695
An actor.

116
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,414
She's not much of a phone person.

117
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,175
So what's the deal
with this father guy?

118
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:59,089
If someone was having my baby,
I'd wanna know about it.

119
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:03,379
Hey, Knick fan, am I interested
in your views on fatherhood?

120
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,179
Look, maybe I should just go.

121
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,256
Maybe you should.

122
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,493
Good luck. . .

123
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,695
. . .and take care.

124
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,578
Know what the Celtics' problem is?
Players run the team.

125
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,895
That is so not true!

126
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,812
-Oh, it is!
-It isn't!

127
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,772
-Breathe.
-Breathe.

128
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,098
You're gonna kill me!

129
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,539
-Fifteen more seconds! 1 4, 1 3, 1 2--
-Count faster!

130
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,374
It'll be okay!
Just keep focusing on Jordy!

131
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,649
Who the hell is Jordy?

132
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,336
Your son.

133
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,292
I don't have a son named Jordy.

134
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,411
We all agreed,
my son's name is Jamie.

135
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,015
Jamie was the name
of Susan's first girlfriend. . .

136
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,693
. . .so we went back to Jordy.

137
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:55,133
What do you mean, back to Jordy?
We never landed on Jordy!

138
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:59,811
We just passed by it during the whole
Jesse/ Cody/Dillon fiasco.

139
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,576
Cramped leg!

140
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,930
-I got it!
-I got it! I'm doing it!

141
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,455
You get to sleep with her!
I get the cramps!

142
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,615
No, you don't!

143
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,890
That is it!
I want both of you out!

144
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,414
-She started it!
-He did!

145
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,930
I don't care! I'm trying to get
a person out of my body here. . .

146
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,297
. . .and you're not making it
any easier! Now go!

147
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,732
-Thanks a lot.
-See what you did?

148
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,493
-Listen--
-Out!

149
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,175
Breathe! Breathe!

150
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,335
What is that?

151
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,536
Something exploded!

152
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,051
It's just her water breaking.
Calm down!

153
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,411
Water breaking?
What do you mean? What's that?

154
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,417
Breathe. Breathe.

155
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,137
Oh, please!
This is so your fault!

156
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,495
How is this my fault?

157
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,931
Carol never threw me out of a room
before you came along.

158
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,779
There's a Lot Carol never did
before I came along.

159
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,536
-Are you trying to be clever?
-You are so threatened by me!

160
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,772
Hey! Okay! AII right!

161
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,459
That's it! Get in here!

162
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,936
My God, you guys!
I don't believe you!

163
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,092
There are children
coming into the world here. . .

164
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:19,696
. . .and your fighting noises are not
the first thing they should hear!

165
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,295
So just stop all the yelling!
Just stop it!

166
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,536
Don't make me do this again!
I don't Like my voice Like this!

167
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,855
Who wants to hear something ironic?

168
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,172
-Help!
-Come on!

169
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,294
-I'm having a baby in there!
-Hello!

170
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,779
Everyone stand back.

171
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,416
Are they here yet?

172
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,890
Don't worry,
we're gonna find them.

173
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,297
And until we do,
we are all here for you. Okay?

174
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,091
Anyway, you were telling me
about Paris. It sounds wonderful!

175
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:12,650
There was this great Little
pastry shop right by my hotel--

176
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,493
There you go, dear.

177
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,016
Come on, Lydia, you can do it!
Push!

178
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,974
Push him out, push him out.
Harder, harder!

179
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,530
Push him out, push him out!
Way out!

180
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,499
Let's get that ball and really move!

181
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,689
Let's get--

182
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,895
I was just--

183
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,255
Push, push, push!

184
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,535
What are you gonna do,
suck the door open?

185
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,740
Help! Help!

186
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,539
And they found their bodies
The very next day

187
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,528
And they found their bodies
The very next--

188
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,216
Mom, everything's going fine.

189
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,893
Ross is great.

190
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,691
He's in a whole other place!

191
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,693
No, he's gone.

192
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,292
No, you don't have to fly back.
Really.

193
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,929
What do you mean,
''This might be your only chance''?

194
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,937
Would you stop?
I'm only 26.

195
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,899
I'm not even thinking
about babies yet.

196
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,372
-Where have you been?
-I just had a baby.

197
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,099
Mazel tov!

198
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,337
It could be one hour or three.

199
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,696
But relax.
She's doing great.

200
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:49,252
So tell me, are you currently
involved with anyone?

201
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,296
Not at the moment, I'm not.

202
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,495
Are you?

203
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,897
No, it's hard enough to get women
to go out with me.

204
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,899
Right. Yeah, I've heard that
about cute doctors.

205
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:05,298
No, really. I suppose it's because
I spend so much time, you know. . .

206
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,934
. . .where I do.

207
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,735
I try not to let work
affect my personal life.

208
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,210
But it's hard when,
when you do. . .

209
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,297
. . .what I do. It's Like. . . .

210
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,295
Well, for instance,
what do you do?

211
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,899
I'm a waitress.

212
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,416
Aren't there times when you come
home at the end of the day. . .

213
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,689
. . .and you're, Like:

214
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,494
''If I see one more cup of coffee'' . . . .

215
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,136
Gotcha.

216
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,293
-I'm gonna check up on your friend.
-That's fine.

217
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,053
How did you know I was here?

218
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,973
Your mom called me.

219
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,898
So is this her?

220
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,052
No, this is a loaner.

221
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,693
Listen, I'm sorry
you had to do this by yourself.

222
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:08,970
I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor,
nurse and a helper guy.

223
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,298
So did you see who won the game?

224
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,493
The Knicks by 1 0.
They suck!

225
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,493
They're not so bad.

226
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,332
Come on! Come on!

227
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,934
Damn it! Damn it!

228
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,410
Damn it, damn it!
This is all your fault!

229
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,009
This should be
the greatest day of my Life!

230
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,694
My son is being born,
and I should be in there!

231
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,095
Instead, I'm stuck
in a closet with you!

232
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,457
I've been waiting for this
just as much as you have!

233
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,697
Believe me, no one's been waiting
for this as much as I have.

234
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,128
And you know what's funny?

235
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,770
You get to go home with the baby.
Where does that leave me?

236
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,299
You get to be his father!

237
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,288
And who am I? There's Father's Day!
There's Mother's Day!

238
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,695
There's no Lesbian Lover Day!

239
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,295
Everyday is Lesbian Lover Day!

240
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,692
This is so great!

241
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,179
Do you wanna explain that?

242
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,937
I mean, when I was growing up,
my dad left. . .

243
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:34,809
. . .and my mother died
and my stepfather went to jail.

244
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:38,496
I barely had enough pieces
of parents to make one whole one.

245
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:42,091
And here's this baby who has
three whole parents. . .

246
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,054
. . .who care so much that they fight
over who gets to Love it the most. . .

247
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,296
. . .and it's not even born yet!

248
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,169
It's just the luckiest baby
in the whole world.

249
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,691
I'm sorry. You were fighting.

250
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,293
Where are they?

251
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,253
-I'm sure they'll be here soon.
-They wouldn’t miss this.

252
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:07,090
Relax! You're only at nine centimeters,
and the baby's at zero station.

253
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,297
You are really frightening me.

254
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,371
Help me!
Trying to rip out my heart!

255
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,294
That's great!
Anybody seen a nipple?

256
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,536
Ten centimeters.
Here we go.

257
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,492
AII right, time to start pushing!

258
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,855
But they're not here yet!

259
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,130
I can't tell the baby
to wait for them.

260
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,292
Oh, God!

261
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,297
Okay, got the vent open.

262
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,296
I'm Ben.

263
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,290
I'm hospital worker Ben.

264
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,618
It's Ben to the rescue!

265
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,528
Ben, you ready?

266
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,099
Give me your foot.

267
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:56,054
On three, Ben.
One, two, three.

268
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,492
Come on, Ben.
That's it, Ben.

269
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,893
What do you see?

270
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:05,818
I see what appears to be
a dark vent.

271
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,129
Wait!

272
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:10,292
Yes, it is, in fact, a dark vent!

273
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,890
Pheebs, it's open!
It's open!

274
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,456
Wait!

275
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,890
You forgot your legs!

276
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,729
Push! Push!

277
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,698
We're here! We're here!

278
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,493
Where have you been?

279
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,489
Long story, honey.

280
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,611
I need you to keep pushing.
I need--

281
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,572
Excuse me, can I have this?

282
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,738
There's too many people here!
There's about to be one more!

283
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:44,370
So anybody who's not an ex-husband
or a lesbian Life partner. . .

284
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,729
. . .out you go!

285
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,250
-Bye-bye!
-Good Luck, you guys!

286
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:52,896
Let me ask you, do you have to be
Carol’s Lesbian Life partner?

287
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,568
Out!

288
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:57,975
Here he comes!

289
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,893
Let me see! I've got to see,
I've got to see!

290
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,295
A head!

291
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,209
It's huge!
How are you doing this?

292
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,416
You're not helping!

293
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,338
You're doing great!
You're doing fine!

294
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,411
-Hello?
-Oh, sorry!

295
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,576
What do you see?
What do you see?

296
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,930
We got a head.
We got arms. We got--

297
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,579
Look at the Little fingers!

298
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,098
A chest and a stomach. . .

299
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,649
. . .and it's a boy, definitely a boy!

300
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,976
Legs, knees and feet.

301
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,095
He's here!

302
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,729
He's a person!

303
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,050
-Look at that!
-Who does he Look Like?

304
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,897
Kind of Like my Uncle Ed,
covered in Jell-O.

305
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,695
Really?

306
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,730
You guys, he's beautiful!

307
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,493
Thanks, Pheebs!

308
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,891
No shouting, but we still need
a name for this Little guy.

309
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,293
How about Ben?

310
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,699
I Like Ben.

311
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,488
Ben.

312
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,694
Ben's good.

313
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,817
How come you never
mentioned Ben before?

314
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,488
We just cooked it up.

315
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,491
That's what we were off doing.

316
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,889
-Can we come in?
-Yeah, come on. Come on.

317
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,493
I know. I know.

318
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,493
Everybody, there's someone
I'd Like you to meet.

319
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,576
This is Ben.

320
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,249
Hi, Ben.

321
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,291
Ben, this is everybody.

322
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,694
Susan, he looks just Like you.

323
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,489
Thanks.

324
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,297
Oh, God! I can't believe one of us
actually has one of these.

325
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,889
I know.
I still am one of these.

326
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,889
Can I?

327
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,652
Okay, the head. You gotta. . . .

328
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,339
I'm your Aunt Monica!
Yes, I am!

329
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,491
I'm your Aunt Monica!

330
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,652
I will always have gum.

331
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,695
Ben. . .

332
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,889
. . .I want you to know that
there may be some times when. . .

333
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,892
. . .I may not be around. . .

334
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,692
. . .Like this.

335
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,894
But I'II still always come back. . .

336
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,095
. . .Like this.

337
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:58,295
And sometimes,
I may be away longer. . .

338
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,888
. . .Like this.

339
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,100
But I'II still always come back. . .

340
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,689
. . .Like this.

341
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:15,419
And sometimes, I'II want you to steal
third and I'II go Like this.

342
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,297
He is so amazing!

343
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,100
Yeah, I know.
Look at him!

344
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,496
Nothing.

345
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,497
I don't think that's his name.

346
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,494
Look, he's closing his eyes.

347
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,694
Look, he's opening his eyes.

348
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,891
He doesn't do much, does he?

349
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,690
Nope, this is pretty much it.

350
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,898
You guys wanna get some coffee?

351
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,696
I'II see you guys later.

352
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,450
Look, he's closing his eyes again.
