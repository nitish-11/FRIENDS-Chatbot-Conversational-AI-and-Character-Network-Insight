1
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,175
Terry, I know I haven't
worked here long. . .

2
00:00:08,418 --> 00:00:10,693
. . .but I was wondering,
would it be possible. . .

3
00:00:10,936 --> 00:00:13,894
. . .if I got a $ 100 advance
on my salary?

4
00:00:14,413 --> 00:00:15,641
An advance?

5
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:18,207
So that I can spend
Thanksgiving with my family.

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:22,489
Every year we ski in Vail, and
my father pays for my ticket. . .

7
00:00:22,727 --> 00:00:25,958
. . .but I've started
this whole independent thing. . .

8
00:00:26,163 --> 00:00:29,075
. . .which is actually why
I took this ''job. ''

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,353
Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart!

10
00:00:34,038 --> 00:00:36,472
You're a terrible, terrible waitress.

11
00:00:37,235 --> 00:00:39,749
Really, really awful.

12
00:00:41,751 --> 00:00:44,185
I hear what you're saying.
I'm with you.

13
00:00:46,148 --> 00:00:50,061
But I'm trying really hard,
and I think I'm doing better.

14
00:00:50,305 --> 00:00:52,136
I really do.

15
00:00:52,783 --> 00:00:54,739
Does anybody need coffee?

16
00:01:00,336 --> 00:01:02,327
The One Where Underdog Gets Away

17
00:01:03,614 --> 00:01:04,603
English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

18
00:01:49,338 --> 00:01:50,134
Excuse me, sir?

19
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:52,891
You come in here all the time.
I was wondering. . .

20
00:01:53,095 --> 00:01:56,929
. . .is there a possibility that
you could advance me my tips?

21
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:03,279
That's fine.
Sorry about that spill before!

22
00:02:04,885 --> 00:02:06,796
Only 98.50 to go!

23
00:02:09,163 --> 00:02:12,519
Did you know Mom and Dad are going
to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?

24
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,637
What? No, they're not.

25
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:16,231
The Blymans invited them.

26
00:02:16,476 --> 00:02:17,306
You're wrong.

27
00:02:19,154 --> 00:02:20,109
I am not wrong.

28
00:02:20,353 --> 00:02:21,263
You're wrong.

29
00:02:22,751 --> 00:02:24,309
No, I just talked to them.

30
00:02:26,149 --> 00:02:27,184
I'm calling Mom.

31
00:02:35,941 --> 00:02:39,570
And this from the Cry for Help
Department: Are you wearing makeup?

32
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:46,692
Yes, I am. As of today, I'm officially
''Joey Tribbiani: actor/model. ''

33
00:02:47,932 --> 00:02:50,765
I was thinking you
look more like ''Joey Tribbiani. . .

34
00:02:51,009 --> 00:02:52,681
. . .man/woman. ''

35
00:02:54,406 --> 00:02:55,680
What were you modeling?

36
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,995
You know those posters for
the City Free Clinic?

37
00:02:58,243 --> 00:03:01,633
So you're gonna be one of those
healthy, healthy, healthy guys?

38
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,950
The asthma guy's really cute.

39
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:06,436
Know which one you're gonna be?

40
00:03:06,796 --> 00:03:08,866
But I hear Lyme disease is open, so. . . .

41
00:03:10,034 --> 00:03:11,945
Good luck, man. I hope you get it.

42
00:03:12,312 --> 00:03:13,347
Thanks.

43
00:03:16,868 --> 00:03:19,223
You were right.
How can they do this to us?

44
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:21,024
It's Thanksgiving!

45
00:03:21,265 --> 00:03:23,221
How about if I cook dinner at my place?

46
00:03:23,464 --> 00:03:24,897
I'll make it just like Mom's.

47
00:03:25,422 --> 00:03:28,220
Will you make the mashed potatoes
with the lumps?

48
00:03:29,179 --> 00:03:31,409
They're not actually supposed to--

49
00:03:31,657 --> 00:03:33,409
I'll work on the lumps.

50
00:03:34,295 --> 00:03:36,251
Joey, you're going home, right?

51
00:03:36,493 --> 00:03:40,202
Chandler, you're still boycotting
all the pilgrim holidays?

52
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:43,440
Yes. Every single one of them.

53
00:03:44,087 --> 00:03:46,999
-Phoebe, you'll be with your grandma?
-And her boyfriend.

54
00:03:47,204 --> 00:03:50,799
But we're celebrating Thanksgiving
in December because he's lunar.

55
00:03:55,358 --> 00:03:57,428
So you're free Thursday, then?

56
00:03:57,677 --> 00:03:59,793
Yeah. Oh, can I come?

57
00:04:01,593 --> 00:04:03,424
Rach, you still going to Vail?

58
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:06,583
Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop!

59
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,899
Only $ 1 02 to go.

60
00:04:09,147 --> 00:04:10,262
I thought it was 98.50?

61
00:04:10,506 --> 00:04:13,066
Well, it was, but I broke a cup.

62
00:04:14,663 --> 00:04:16,654
Well, I'm off to Carol's.

63
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,771
Ooh, ooh, why don't we invite her?

64
00:04:19,778 --> 00:04:22,372
Ooh, ooh, because she's my ex-wife. . .

65
00:04:22,616 --> 00:04:26,768
. . .and will probably want to bring
her ooh, ooh, lesbian life-partner.

66
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,595
Is Carol here?

67
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:39,880
No, she's at a faculty meeting.

68
00:04:41,241 --> 00:04:43,960
I just came by to pick up my skull.

69
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,275
Well, not mine, but. . . .

70
00:04:46,837 --> 00:04:48,156
Come in.

71
00:04:48,636 --> 00:04:52,675
Carol borrowed it for a class, and I
have to get it back to the museum.

72
00:04:52,912 --> 00:04:53,867
What's it look like?

73
00:04:54,591 --> 00:04:56,866
Kind of like a big face without skin.

74
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:02,579
I'm familiar with the concept.

75
00:05:02,825 --> 00:05:04,736
You can just look for it.

76
00:05:12,217 --> 00:05:15,129
You guys sure have a lot of books
about being a lesbian.

77
00:05:18,972 --> 00:05:21,167
You know, you have to take a course.

78
00:05:22,809 --> 00:05:24,800
Otherwise they don't let you do it.

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,673
Yertle the Turtle!
A classic.

80
00:05:36,917 --> 00:05:39,511
Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.

81
00:05:41,593 --> 00:05:44,585
The baby that hasn't been born yet?

82
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,901
Wouldn't that mean you're. . .

83
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,299
. . .crazy?

84
00:05:49,468 --> 00:05:52,301
What? You don't think they can
hear sounds in there?

85
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:54,940
You're not serious? I mean. . .

86
00:05:55,183 --> 00:05:56,616
. . .you really talk to it?

87
00:05:57,141 --> 00:06:00,372
Yeah, all the time.
I want the baby to know my voice.

88
00:06:01,578 --> 00:06:03,455
Do you talk about me?

89
00:06:05,374 --> 00:06:06,250
All the time.

90
00:06:06,494 --> 00:06:07,290
Really?

91
00:06:09,172 --> 00:06:12,289
We just refer to you
as ''Bobo, the sperm guy. ''

92
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:27,472
If she's talking to it, I just think
I should get some belly-time too.

93
00:06:27,757 --> 00:06:29,873
Not that I believe any of this.

94
00:06:30,115 --> 00:06:33,551
I believe it. I think the baby can
totally hear everything.

95
00:06:34,552 --> 00:06:36,543
I'll show you.
This will seem a little weird.

96
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:40,180
But you put your head
inside this turkey. . .

97
00:06:40,427 --> 00:06:43,464
. . .and we'll all talk and you'll
hear everything we say.

98
00:06:45,343 --> 00:06:48,858
I'd just like to say I'm totally
behind this experiment.

99
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:53,049
In fact, I'd very much like
to butter your head.

100
00:06:58,133 --> 00:07:00,693
-Did you make your money?
-Not even close.

101
00:07:00,931 --> 00:07:02,842
Forget Vail.
Forget seeing my family.

102
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,446
Forget shoop, shoop, shoop.

103
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,072
Here's your mail.

104
00:07:11,323 --> 00:07:13,439
Thanks. You can just
put it on the table.

105
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:17,230
Here's your mail!

106
00:07:18,078 --> 00:07:21,434
Thanks. You can just
put it on the table!

107
00:07:21,914 --> 00:07:23,632
Would you just open it!

108
00:07:26,231 --> 00:07:28,028
Oh, my God!

109
00:07:28,269 --> 00:07:31,227
You guys are great!

110
00:07:31,586 --> 00:07:33,497
We all chipped in.

111
00:07:33,705 --> 00:07:34,660
We did?

112
00:07:34,904 --> 00:07:36,462
You owe me $20.

113
00:07:36,743 --> 00:07:39,052
Thank you. Thank you so much!

114
00:07:39,301 --> 00:07:40,370
Chandler, here you go.

115
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,975
Your traditional holiday feast.
Tomato soup. . .

116
00:07:43,218 --> 00:07:47,052
. . .grilled-cheese fixings and
your family-size bag of Funyuns.

117
00:07:47,294 --> 00:07:49,524
This is your Thanksgiving dinner?

118
00:07:49,772 --> 00:07:52,206
What is it with you
and this holiday?

119
00:07:53,649 --> 00:07:54,968
I'm 9 years old.

120
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,687
I hate this story!

121
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,804
We've just finished
Thanksgiving dinner.

122
00:07:59,005 --> 00:08:00,836
I have-- I remember
this part vividly--

123
00:08:01,084 --> 00:08:03,040
--a mouthful of pumpkin pie.

124
00:08:03,281 --> 00:08:07,035
And this is the moment my parents
tell me they're getting divorced.

125
00:08:07,318 --> 00:08:08,512
Oh, my God!

126
00:08:08,757 --> 00:08:12,989
Very difficult to enjoy Thanksgiving
dinner once you've seen it in reverse.

127
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:32,817
We used to work together.

128
00:08:33,058 --> 00:08:33,934
We did?

129
00:08:34,657 --> 00:08:37,569
At Macy's. You're
the Obsession girl, right?

130
00:08:38,334 --> 00:08:40,165
I was the Aramis guy.

131
00:08:41,411 --> 00:08:43,971
Aramis? Aramis?

132
00:08:45,248 --> 00:08:46,203
Yeah, right!

133
00:08:47,007 --> 00:08:49,237
You're the best in the business.

134
00:08:49,485 --> 00:08:50,964
-Get out!
-I'm serious!

135
00:08:51,203 --> 00:08:55,162
You're amazing! You know when to
spritz. You know when to lay back.

136
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,950
Really? You don't know
what that means to me.

137
00:09:01,195 --> 00:09:04,631
You smell great tonight.
What are you wearing?

138
00:09:05,752 --> 00:09:07,424
Nothing.

139
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,418
Listen, do you wanna go get a drink?

140
00:09:18,662 --> 00:09:21,335
Yeah, that would be--

141
00:09:22,698 --> 00:09:25,576
-What's wrong?
-I remembered I have to do something.

142
00:09:26,216 --> 00:09:27,535
What?

143
00:09:29,972 --> 00:09:31,291
Leave.

144
00:09:31,491 --> 00:09:33,527
Wait, wait, wait!

145
00:10:14,098 --> 00:10:15,577
I guess you all saw it.

146
00:10:17,135 --> 00:10:17,931
Saw what?

147
00:10:18,334 --> 00:10:21,724
We're just laughing. You know
how laughter can be infectious.

148
00:10:40,676 --> 00:10:44,430
Set another place for Thanksgiving.
My entire family thinks I have VD.

149
00:10:46,232 --> 00:10:48,507
''Tonight, on a very special Blossom. ''

150
00:11:00,341 --> 00:11:01,774
Looking good! Okay!

151
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:06,252
Cider's mulling, turkey's
turking, yams are yamming. . . .

152
00:11:07,095 --> 00:11:08,289
What?

153
00:11:08,854 --> 00:11:12,164
I don't know. It's just not
the same without Mom in the kitchen.

154
00:11:13,011 --> 00:11:15,525
That's it. Get out of
my way and stop annoying me!

155
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:17,248
Well, that's closer.

156
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:20,240
I got the tickets!

157
00:11:20,485 --> 00:11:24,273
Five hours from now,
shoop, shoop, shoop!

158
00:11:24,522 --> 00:11:26,877
Oh, you must stop shooping.

159
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,031
I'm gonna get my stuff.

160
00:11:29,638 --> 00:11:31,390
Will you just come in, already?

161
00:11:31,636 --> 00:11:35,106
I prefer to keep a safe distance
from all this merriment.

162
00:11:35,353 --> 00:11:38,425
Look out! Incoming pumpkin pie!

163
00:11:44,786 --> 00:11:48,620
We all laughed when you did it with
the stuffing, but that's not funny.

164
00:11:50,301 --> 00:11:53,771
Monica, I got a question.
I don't see any Tater Tots.

165
00:11:53,978 --> 00:11:55,616
That's not a question.

166
00:11:56,057 --> 00:11:58,617
But my mom always makes them.
It's a tradition.

167
00:11:58,854 --> 00:12:02,608
A piece of turkey on your fork,
a little cranberry sauce and a Tot!

168
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,200
I mean it's. . .

169
00:12:05,689 --> 00:12:10,001
. . .bad enough I can't be with
my family, because of my disease.

170
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:12,640
All right. Fine.

171
00:12:12,883 --> 00:12:16,034
Tonight's potatoes will be both
mashed with lumps. . .

172
00:12:16,281 --> 00:12:18,397
. . .and in the form of Tots.

173
00:12:20,717 --> 00:12:23,072
I'm off to talk to my unborn child.

174
00:12:25,394 --> 00:12:26,986
Mom never hit.

175
00:12:31,549 --> 00:12:33,187
Okay, all done.

176
00:12:33,827 --> 00:12:36,785
Phoebe, did you whip the pota--?

177
00:12:36,984 --> 00:12:38,383
Ross needs lumps!

178
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,414
Oh, I'm sorry!
I just--

179
00:12:40,702 --> 00:12:45,378
I thought we could have them whipped
and then add some peas and onions.

180
00:12:46,017 --> 00:12:47,166
Why would we do that?

181
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,805
Then they'd be like
my mom used to make it. . .

182
00:12:50,054 --> 00:12:51,282
. . .before she died.

183
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:57,569
Three kinds of potatoes coming up.

184
00:12:58,967 --> 00:13:00,844
Goodbye, you guys!

185
00:13:01,085 --> 00:13:02,154
Thanks for everything!

186
00:13:02,404 --> 00:13:06,158
Oh, God, look at-- Sorry!
I'm so sorry.

187
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,395
The most unbelievable thing has
happened! Underdog has gotten away!

188
00:13:11,597 --> 00:13:12,393
The balloon?

189
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:15,111
No, the actual cartoon character.

190
00:13:16,473 --> 00:13:18,509
Of course the balloon!

191
00:13:18,751 --> 00:13:20,150
It's all over the news.

192
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:24,099
He broke free and was spotted
over Washington Square Park.

193
00:13:24,307 --> 00:13:25,865
I'm going to the roof.
Who's with me?

194
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:27,458
I can't. I gotta go!

195
00:13:27,704 --> 00:13:31,140
An 80-foot dog loose over the city?
How often does that happen?

196
00:13:31,341 --> 00:13:32,933
Almost never.

197
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,535
Got the keys?

198
00:13:41,014 --> 00:13:42,288
Anytime you're ready!

199
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:46,922
Okay, here we go.

200
00:13:51,406 --> 00:13:54,125
Where am I talking to here?

201
00:13:55,482 --> 00:13:59,714
There is one way that seems to offer
a certain acoustical advantage, but. . . .

202
00:14:00,918 --> 00:14:02,431
Just aim for the bump.

203
00:14:07,353 --> 00:14:08,911
Okay, here goes.

204
00:14:16,585 --> 00:14:18,541
You know, I can't do this.

205
00:14:19,743 --> 00:14:21,779
It's too weird. I feel stupid.

206
00:14:22,741 --> 00:14:26,575
It's fine. You don't have to do it
just because Susan does it.

207
00:14:27,097 --> 00:14:29,088
Hello, baby!

208
00:14:32,093 --> 00:14:35,722
--the moment we first saw the giant dog
shadow fall over the park!

209
00:14:35,969 --> 00:14:39,006
But did they have to shoot him down?
That was just mean.

210
00:14:40,686 --> 00:14:43,996
Right about now the turkey should
be crispy on the outside. . .

211
00:14:44,244 --> 00:14:45,882
. . .and juicy on the inside.

212
00:14:47,481 --> 00:14:49,073
Why are we standing here?

213
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,555
We're waiting for you to open
the door. You've got the keys.

214
00:14:52,757 --> 00:14:54,270
No, I don't.

215
00:14:55,555 --> 00:14:59,104
Yes, you do. When we left,
you said, ''Got the keys. ''

216
00:14:59,671 --> 00:15:01,468
No, I didn't. I asked. . .

217
00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:03,825
. . . ''Got the keys?''

218
00:15:05,307 --> 00:15:07,537
You said, ''Got the keys! ''

219
00:15:07,785 --> 00:15:10,458
Either of you have the keys?

220
00:15:12,021 --> 00:15:12,851
The oven is on!

221
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,539
I've gotta get my ticket!

222
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,418
Wait! We have a copy of your key.

223
00:15:16,657 --> 00:15:17,646
Then get it!

224
00:15:17,897 --> 00:15:20,127
That tone won't make me go any faster.

225
00:15:21,374 --> 00:15:22,648
That one will.

226
00:15:25,651 --> 00:15:29,849
And everyone's telling me,
''You gotta pick a major! ''

227
00:15:30,087 --> 00:15:33,841
So on a dare, I picked paleontology.

228
00:15:35,123 --> 00:15:40,038
And you have no idea what I'm saying,
because, let's face it, you're a fetus.

229
00:15:41,518 --> 00:15:44,237
You're just happy you don't
have gills anymore.

230
00:15:45,715 --> 00:15:48,354
You don't have to talk to it.
You can sing to it.

231
00:15:48,592 --> 00:15:51,152
Please. I am not singing
to your stomach.

232
00:15:52,909 --> 00:15:54,342
How's it going?

233
00:15:54,588 --> 00:15:56,419
Here we come

234
00:15:56,626 --> 00:15:58,423
Walking down the street

235
00:15:58,664 --> 00:16:02,452
Get the funniest looks from
Everyone we meet

236
00:16:02,702 --> 00:16:04,021
Hey, hey--

237
00:16:08,496 --> 00:16:09,849
-Did you feel that?
-I did.

238
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:12,245
-Does it always--?
-That was the first!

239
00:16:12,494 --> 00:16:14,007
Keep singing! Keep singing!

240
00:16:15,092 --> 00:16:17,003
Hey, hey, you're my baby

241
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:20,004
And I can 't wait to meet you

242
00:16:20,207 --> 00:16:23,995
When you come out I'll buy you a bagel
And then we'll go to the zoo

243
00:16:24,844 --> 00:16:26,482
I felt it that time!

244
00:16:26,722 --> 00:16:28,041
Hey, hey, I'm your daddy

245
00:16:28,281 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm the one without any breasts

246
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:35,990
Not that one.

247
00:16:36,235 --> 00:16:37,827
Can you go any faster?

248
00:16:38,073 --> 00:16:41,986
I got one keyhole and a zillion keys!
You do the math.

249
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,983
Why do you guys have so many
keys in there anyway?

250
00:16:45,267 --> 00:16:47,576
For an emergency just like this.

251
00:16:48,824 --> 00:16:51,258
All right. Listen, smirky!

252
00:16:51,502 --> 00:16:53,413
If it wasn't for your stupid balloon. . .

253
00:16:53,661 --> 00:16:58,257
. . .I'd be on a plane watching a woman
do this right now. But I'm not!

254
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:01,895
I swear you said you had the keys!

255
00:17:02,134 --> 00:17:04,694
I wouldn't say I had the
keys unless I had the keys!

256
00:17:04,972 --> 00:17:06,803
I obviously did not have the keys!

257
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,962
That's it! Enough with the keys.
No one say ''keys'' !

258
00:17:12,526 --> 00:17:14,756
Why would I have the keys!

259
00:17:15,404 --> 00:17:17,315
Besides the fact that
you said you did?

260
00:17:17,522 --> 00:17:19,672
-But I didn't!
-Well, you should have.

261
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,069
-Why?
-Because!

262
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:23,349
Because everything's
my responsibility?

263
00:17:23,557 --> 00:17:25,912
Isn't it enough that I'm making
Thanksgiving dinner?

264
00:17:26,155 --> 00:17:30,068
Everyone wants a different potato,
so I'm making different potatoes.

265
00:17:30,312 --> 00:17:34,146
Does anybody care what kind
of potatoes I want?

266
00:17:36,986 --> 00:17:39,784
Just as long as Phoebe gets
her peas and onions. . .

267
00:17:40,024 --> 00:17:41,935
. . .and Mario gets his Tots.

268
00:17:42,383 --> 00:17:44,658
It's my first Thanksgiving, and I--

269
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:48,455
It's all burnt, and I can't. . . .

270
00:17:50,815 --> 00:17:53,045
Monica, only dogs can hear you now.

271
00:17:53,293 --> 00:17:55,727
Look, the door's open!
Here we go.

272
00:18:01,807 --> 00:18:03,923
The turkey's burnt!

273
00:18:04,205 --> 00:18:07,720
Potatoes are ruined! Potatoes
are ruined! Potatoes are ruined!

274
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:09,949
Here we come

275
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,311
Walking down the--

276
00:18:14,556 --> 00:18:16,706
This doesn't smell like Mom's.

277
00:18:18,634 --> 00:18:21,023
It doesn't, does it?
But you wanted lumps.

278
00:18:21,271 --> 00:18:23,387
Well, here you go, buddy.
You got one!

279
00:18:25,907 --> 00:18:27,101
God, this is great!

280
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:30,423
The plane is gone, so I guess
I'm stuck here with you guys.

281
00:18:30,664 --> 00:18:34,498
We all had better plans, okay?
This was nobody's first choice!

282
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,689
Oh, really?

283
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:39,774
So why was I busting my ass
to make this delicious dinner?

284
00:18:40,016 --> 00:18:41,051
You call that delicious?

285
00:18:44,453 --> 00:18:46,171
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

286
00:18:46,931 --> 00:18:49,047
Now, this feels like Thanksgiving.

287
00:19:03,717 --> 00:19:04,627
What?

288
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:08,233
Ugly Naked Guy's taking
his turkey out of the oven.

289
00:19:11,152 --> 00:19:13,712
Oh, my God! He's not alone.

290
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,019
Ugly Naked Guy. . .

291
00:19:15,269 --> 00:19:18,102
. . .is having Thanksgiving
dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.

292
00:19:19,945 --> 00:19:21,663
I gotta see this!

293
00:19:24,821 --> 00:19:26,777
All right, Ugly Naked Guy!

294
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,654
Ugly naked dancing!

295
00:19:30,496 --> 00:19:32,771
It's nice that he has someone.

296
00:19:43,247 --> 00:19:44,236
Shall I carve?

297
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:46,320
By all means.

298
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:55,232
Who wants light cheese,
and who wants dark cheese?

299
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:59,029
I don't even want to know
about the dark cheese.

300
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:02,022
-Does anybody want to split this?
-I will.

301
00:20:02,271 --> 00:20:03,670
You guys have to make a wish.

302
00:20:04,669 --> 00:20:05,499
Make a wish?

303
00:20:05,749 --> 00:20:07,819
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving.

304
00:20:12,183 --> 00:20:14,936
You got the bigger half!
What did you wish for?

305
00:20:15,661 --> 00:20:17,413
The bigger half.

306
00:20:19,657 --> 00:20:21,807
All right, I'd like to
propose a toast.

307
00:20:22,295 --> 00:20:24,206
A little toast here. Ding, ding!

308
00:20:24,813 --> 00:20:27,566
This isn't exactly the kind of
Thanksgiving you planned. . .

309
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:31,440
. . .but for me this has
been really great.

310
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:34,998
I think because it didn't
involve divorce. . .

311
00:20:35,205 --> 00:20:36,797
. . .or projectile vomiting.

312
00:20:39,002 --> 00:20:40,720
If you had gone to Vail. . .

313
00:20:40,961 --> 00:20:44,397
. . .or if you had been with your
family, or if you didn't have. . .

314
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,476
. . .syphilis and stuff. . .

315
00:20:49,034 --> 00:20:50,592
. . .we wouldn't be
all together.

316
00:20:50,793 --> 00:20:53,307
So I guess what I'm trying
to say is. . .

317
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:58,180
. . .I'm very thankful that all
of your Thanksgivings sucked.

318
00:20:59,346 --> 00:21:02,383
-That's so sweet!
-Thank you.

319
00:21:04,621 --> 00:21:06,577
Here's to a lousy Christmas!

320
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,776
And a crappy New Year!
