1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,033
All right, Phoebe?

2
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:07,597
If I were omnipotent for a day,
I would want world peace. . .

3
00:00:07,798 --> 00:00:10,756
. . .no more hunger,
good things for the rain forest.

4
00:00:11,796 --> 00:00:12,990
And bigger boobs.

5
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:16,824
Well, see, you took mine.

6
00:00:18,234 --> 00:00:19,030
What about you?

7
00:00:19,233 --> 00:00:23,021
If I were omnipotent for a day,
I'd make myself omnipotent forever.

8
00:00:23,911 --> 00:00:25,390
There's always one guy. . . .

9
00:00:25,631 --> 00:00:28,623
''If I had a wish, I'd wish
for three more wishes. ''

10
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:32,063
Hey, Joey.

11
00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:34,339
What would you do
if you were omnipotent?

12
00:00:35,067 --> 00:00:36,819
Probably kill myself.

13
00:00:38,386 --> 00:00:39,501
Excuse me?

14
00:00:39,745 --> 00:00:43,135
If little Joey's dead,
then I got no reason to live.

15
00:00:45,223 --> 00:00:47,373
Joey, omnipotent.

16
00:00:48,902 --> 00:00:50,620
You are?

17
00:00:51,061 --> 00:00:52,653
Ross, I'm--

18
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,976
The One With George Stephanopoulos

19
00:00:56,259 --> 00:00:57,248
English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

20
00:01:43,681 --> 00:01:45,399
How does she do that?

21
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,189
I cannot sleep in a public place.

22
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,187
Would you look at her?

23
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:52,315
She's so peaceful.

24
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:56,190
What?

25
00:01:57,435 --> 00:02:00,233
It's okay. You just nodded off again.

26
00:02:00,474 --> 00:02:01,509
What's going on?

27
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:03,073
I got no sleep last night.

28
00:02:03,273 --> 00:02:05,992
My grandmother has
this new boyfriend. . .

29
00:02:07,072 --> 00:02:10,189
. . .and they're both
kind of insecure in bed, so--

30
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:11,869
And deaf.

31
00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:17,383
They're constantly reassuring
each other they're having a good time.

32
00:02:17,588 --> 00:02:19,579
You have no idea how loud they are.

33
00:02:21,546 --> 00:02:23,184
You can stay with Rachel and me.

34
00:02:23,425 --> 00:02:24,574
Thanks.

35
00:02:24,785 --> 00:02:26,537
--95, 96, 97.

36
00:02:26,984 --> 00:02:30,772
See, I told you. Less than
1 00 steps from our place to here.

37
00:02:31,022 --> 00:02:33,775
You got way too much free time, man.

38
00:02:34,381 --> 00:02:36,576
There's the birthday boy.

39
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:37,856
Check it out.

40
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,376
Hockey tickets. Rangers-Penguins
tonight and we're taking you.

41
00:02:41,618 --> 00:02:42,528
Happy birthday!

42
00:02:42,778 --> 00:02:44,177
We love you, man.

43
00:02:45,817 --> 00:02:48,377
It's funny. My birthday
was seven months ago.

44
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:51,365
-So?
-I'm guessing you had an extra ticket. . .

45
00:02:51,614 --> 00:02:53,969
. . .and couldn't decide
who got to bring a date?

46
00:02:55,253 --> 00:02:57,972
Well, aren't we
Mr. ''The Glass is Half Empty. ''

47
00:02:58,932 --> 00:03:00,365
Oh, my God!

48
00:03:00,771 --> 00:03:02,602
Is today the 20th?
October 20th?

49
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,966
I was hoping you wouldn't remember.

50
00:03:05,449 --> 00:03:06,768
What's wrong with the 20th?

51
00:03:07,009 --> 00:03:10,160
Eleven days before Halloween?
All the good costumes are gone?

52
00:03:11,407 --> 00:03:14,365
Today's the day Carol and I. . .

53
00:03:15,045 --> 00:03:16,956
. . .first consummated. . .

54
00:03:17,365 --> 00:03:19,356
. . .our physical relationship.

55
00:03:20,723 --> 00:03:22,156
Sex.

56
00:03:24,922 --> 00:03:26,401
I better pass on the game.

57
00:03:26,641 --> 00:03:31,157
I'm just gonna go home and think
about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.

58
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:34,953
The hell with hockey!
Let's all do that!

59
00:03:36,837 --> 00:03:39,112
Come on, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice!

60
00:03:39,316 --> 00:03:42,513
Guys night out! Come on,
what do you say, big guy? Huh?

61
00:03:43,195 --> 00:03:45,345
-What are you doing?
-I have no idea.

62
00:03:45,954 --> 00:03:46,989
Come on, Ross.

63
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:49,872
All right. Maybe it will
take my mind off it.

64
00:03:50,112 --> 00:03:53,309
-Promise to buy me a big foam finger?
-You got it.

65
00:03:53,671 --> 00:03:54,467
Look, look!

66
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,149
My first paycheck!

67
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,544
Look at the window!

68
00:03:57,789 --> 00:04:00,349
There's my name! Hi, me!

69
00:04:01,987 --> 00:04:03,898
I remember when
I got my first paycheck.

70
00:04:04,306 --> 00:04:07,423
There was a cave-in in a mine,
and eight people were killed.

71
00:04:09,424 --> 00:04:10,743
You worked in a mine?

72
00:04:11,144 --> 00:04:13,533
No, I worked at a Dairy Queen.
Why?

73
00:04:16,822 --> 00:04:19,382
Isn't this exciting?
I earned this.

74
00:04:19,581 --> 00:04:22,175
I wiped tables for it.
I steamed milk for it.

75
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:23,932
And it was totally. . .

76
00:04:24,499 --> 00:04:26,137
. . .not worth it.

77
00:04:26,818 --> 00:04:29,457
Who's FICA?
Why's he getting all my money?

78
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,532
I mean, what--?
Chandler, look at that.

79
00:04:35,215 --> 00:04:36,967
This is not that bad.

80
00:04:37,214 --> 00:04:39,250
You're fine for a first job.

81
00:04:40,173 --> 00:04:42,733
You can totally, totally
live on this.

82
00:04:45,691 --> 00:04:48,046
By the way, great service today.

83
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,484
-Terrific!
-Excellent!

84
00:04:52,728 --> 00:04:54,161
Hockey!

85
00:05:05,403 --> 00:05:06,722
Hockey!

86
00:05:09,241 --> 00:05:10,037
Rachel?

87
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,195
Oh, my God!

88
00:05:18,998 --> 00:05:21,910
I swear I've seen birds
do this on Wild Kingdom.

89
00:05:23,196 --> 00:05:24,868
What are you guys doing here?

90
00:05:25,115 --> 00:05:28,346
We were in the city shopping,
and your mom said you work here. . .

91
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:30,505
. . .and it's true!

92
00:05:32,552 --> 00:05:35,669
Look at you in the apron.
You look like you're in a play.

93
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,900
God, look at you! You are so big!
I can't believe it!

94
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:44,504
I know, I know!
I'm a duplex.

95
00:05:46,027 --> 00:05:47,665
So what's going on with you?

96
00:05:47,867 --> 00:05:51,018
Guess who my dad's making
partner in his firm?

97
00:05:53,984 --> 00:05:56,498
And while we're on
the subject of news. . . .

98
00:05:59,822 --> 00:06:02,097
Look! I have elbows!

99
00:06:07,859 --> 00:06:09,417
Passes it up to Leetch.

100
00:06:09,658 --> 00:06:12,491
Leetch spots Messier in the crease.
Here's the pass!

101
00:06:14,096 --> 00:06:17,611
We'll take a time-out while Messier
looks at some women's shoes.

102
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:21,173
Carol was wearing boots
just like those the night. . .

103
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:22,893
. . .that we first. . . .

104
00:06:23,373 --> 00:06:24,692
You know?

105
00:06:24,932 --> 00:06:26,331
In fact, she. . .

106
00:06:26,572 --> 00:06:28,483
. . .she never took them off.

107
00:06:28,771 --> 00:06:31,080
It's because we--
Sorry.

108
00:06:36,408 --> 00:06:37,204
What?

109
00:06:37,767 --> 00:06:38,563
Peach pit.

110
00:06:39,087 --> 00:06:39,997
Yes, bunny?

111
00:06:41,486 --> 00:06:42,521
Peach pit.

112
00:06:42,765 --> 00:06:45,438
-That night, we had--
-Peaches?

113
00:06:45,684 --> 00:06:48,039
Actually, nectarines,
but basically. . . .

114
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:50,512
Could've been a peach.

115
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,993
Then we got dressed. . .

116
00:06:54,241 --> 00:06:56,118
. . .and I walked her to. . .

117
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,271
. . .the bus stop.

118
00:06:59,199 --> 00:06:59,995
I'm fine.

119
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:03,028
That woman's got
an ass like Carol's.

120
00:07:07,676 --> 00:07:10,270
What? I thought we were
trying to find stuff.

121
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,982
Come on, you guys.
Tell me all the dirt.

122
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:17,905
The biggest news is still you
dumping Barry at the altar.

123
00:07:20,031 --> 00:07:23,546
All right, let's talk
reality for a second.

124
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,900
-When are you coming home?
-What?

125
00:07:26,109 --> 00:07:27,701
Guys, I'm not.

126
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,098
Come on. This is us.

127
00:07:30,347 --> 00:07:31,700
I'm not.

128
00:07:31,946 --> 00:07:35,256
This is what I'm doing now.
I've got this job.

129
00:07:35,505 --> 00:07:36,381
Waitressing?

130
00:07:37,464 --> 00:07:40,058
I'm not just waitressing.

131
00:07:40,263 --> 00:07:41,662
I mean, I'm. . . .

132
00:07:44,741 --> 00:07:47,972
I write the specials
on the specials board.

133
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:52,293
And I take the dead flowers
out of the vase.

134
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:57,091
Sometimes Arturo lets me put the little
chocolate blobbies on the cookies.

135
00:07:57,337 --> 00:08:00,056
Your mom didn't tell us
about the blobbies.

136
00:08:10,971 --> 00:08:12,689
How was it with your friends?

137
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:20,086
Okay, how would you like
some Tiki-Death punch?

138
00:08:20,328 --> 00:08:21,477
What's that?

139
00:08:21,727 --> 00:08:23,843
-Well, it's rum and--
-Okay.

140
00:08:26,525 --> 00:08:29,801
We thought since Phoebe's staying over
we'd have a slumber party.

141
00:08:30,044 --> 00:08:31,238
We got trashy magazines.

142
00:08:31,483 --> 00:08:33,633
We got cookie dough.
We got Twister.

143
00:08:34,842 --> 00:08:36,241
And I brought Operation.

144
00:08:36,442 --> 00:08:39,832
But I lost the tweezers
so we can't operate.

145
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,831
But we can prep the guy.

146
00:08:45,078 --> 00:08:47,148
Rach, it's the VISA-card people.

147
00:08:47,397 --> 00:08:49,433
Oh, God.
Ask them what they want.

148
00:08:49,676 --> 00:08:52,634
Could you please tell me
what this is in reference to?

149
00:08:53,795 --> 00:08:54,591
Yes, hold on.

150
00:08:54,874 --> 00:08:57,308
There's been unusual
activity on your account.

151
00:08:57,553 --> 00:08:59,748
But I haven't used my card in weeks.

152
00:08:59,992 --> 00:09:01,630
That is the unusual activity.

153
00:09:03,631 --> 00:09:05,622
They just wanna see if you're okay.

154
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,662
They wanna know if I'm okay?

155
00:09:07,909 --> 00:09:10,469
They wanna know if I'm okay.
Okay, let's see.

156
00:09:10,668 --> 00:09:13,626
Let's see. The FICA guys took
all my money.

157
00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:16,620
Everyone I know is either
getting married or pregnant. . .

158
00:09:16,826 --> 00:09:19,021
. . .or promoted.
And I'm getting coffee.

159
00:09:19,265 --> 00:09:21,256
And it's not even for me!

160
00:09:21,504 --> 00:09:24,940
If that sounds like I'm okay,
then tell them I'm okay. Okay?

161
00:09:28,022 --> 00:09:30,252
Rachel has left the building.

162
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,776
Can you call back?

163
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,056
All right! Come on!

164
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:38,015
Let's play Twister!

165
00:09:46,455 --> 00:09:48,411
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry.

166
00:09:51,013 --> 00:09:53,607
There was ice there
that night with Carol?

167
00:09:53,812 --> 00:09:57,407
Plastic seats? Four thousand
angry Pittsburgh fans?

168
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,841
I was just saying it looks
like we're not sitting together.

169
00:10:02,089 --> 00:10:05,399
But now that you mention it,
there was ice there that night.

170
00:10:06,367 --> 00:10:08,801
It was the first frost.

171
00:10:09,686 --> 00:10:11,563
Just sit down. Sit.

172
00:10:11,805 --> 00:10:15,241
You should feel great. You're doing
this amazing independent thing.

173
00:10:15,483 --> 00:10:17,394
Monica, what is so amazing?

174
00:10:17,643 --> 00:10:21,841
I gave up, like, everything.
And for what?

175
00:10:22,081 --> 00:10:23,560
You are just like Jack.

176
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,428
Jack from downstairs?

177
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:28,394
No, Jack and the Beanstalk.

178
00:10:29,358 --> 00:10:30,916
Ah, the other Jack.

179
00:10:31,957 --> 00:10:33,310
See, he gave up something. . .

180
00:10:33,516 --> 00:10:35,393
. . .but he got those magic beans.

181
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:37,115
Then he woke up and there was. . .

182
00:10:37,355 --> 00:10:39,585
. . .this big plant. . .

183
00:10:39,794 --> 00:10:43,025
. . .outside of his window,
full of possibilities and stuff.

184
00:10:43,273 --> 00:10:46,788
And he lived in a village,
and you live in the Village.

185
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:50,587
Okay, but Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow.

186
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,821
I gave up an orthodontist.

187
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,344
Okay, I know I didn't love him. . . .

188
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,783
See, Jack did love the cow.

189
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:01,386
But, see, it was a plan.
It was clear.

190
00:11:01,626 --> 00:11:04,663
Everything was figured out
and now everything's like. . . .

191
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,183
''Flupie''?

192
00:11:08,143 --> 00:11:10,896
You're not the only one.
We don't know where we're going.

193
00:11:11,142 --> 00:11:13,610
At some point, it's all
gonna come together. . .

194
00:11:13,861 --> 00:11:16,500
. . .and it's just gonna be ''un-flupie. ''

195
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,253
Yeah, like that's a word.

196
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:24,655
Okay, but, Monica, what if
it doesn't come together?

197
00:11:29,175 --> 00:11:32,531
Well, because you just--
I don't like this question.

198
00:11:33,653 --> 00:11:37,009
See, you guys? What if we
don't get magic beans?

199
00:11:37,212 --> 00:11:39,362
I mean, what if all we've got are. . .

200
00:11:39,971 --> 00:11:41,563
. . .beans.

201
00:11:45,209 --> 00:11:46,278
Get him!

202
00:11:46,528 --> 00:11:47,961
Get him! Get him!

203
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:51,566
Yes! You're not laughing now,
are you, pal?

204
00:11:51,806 --> 00:11:55,116
All you need are toothless guys
hitting each other with sticks.

205
00:11:55,325 --> 00:11:57,555
Pass it! Pass it!

206
00:11:57,804 --> 00:11:58,793
He's open!

207
00:11:59,043 --> 00:12:00,522
Shoot it!

208
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,553
We're on that TV thing.

209
00:12:23,834 --> 00:12:25,153
Excuse me?

210
00:12:25,633 --> 00:12:29,751
It says to call if you're not completely
satisfied with this candy bar.

211
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,343
Well, I'm not completely satisfied.

212
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:38,668
It's kind of an emergency.

213
00:12:38,908 --> 00:12:41,217
You know that, or we'd be
in the predicament room.

214
00:12:44,146 --> 00:12:45,261
Hold on.

215
00:12:45,506 --> 00:12:47,258
Fill these out. Sit over there!

216
00:12:47,505 --> 00:12:49,336
I don't wanna make any trouble.

217
00:12:49,584 --> 00:12:53,816
But I'm in a lot of pain here,
all right? My face is dented.

218
00:12:54,062 --> 00:12:55,700
You'll have to wait your turn.

219
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,136
How long will it be?

220
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,532
Any minute now.

221
00:13:16,214 --> 00:13:20,446
I'm so sorry, you guys.
I didn't mean to bring you down.

222
00:13:20,692 --> 00:13:22,523
No, you were right.

223
00:13:23,131 --> 00:13:25,122
I don't have a plan.

224
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:28,924
Pizza guy!

225
00:13:29,169 --> 00:13:30,727
-Thank God.
-Food!

226
00:13:31,008 --> 00:13:33,044
-Phoebe?
-What?

227
00:13:33,287 --> 00:13:34,925
Do you have a plan?

228
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:36,918
I don't even have a ''pla. ''

229
00:13:39,805 --> 00:13:41,955
One mushroom, green pepper and onion?

230
00:13:44,403 --> 00:13:45,961
That's not what we ordered!

231
00:13:46,202 --> 00:13:49,717
We ordered a fat-free crust
with extra cheese!

232
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,109
Wait. You're not G. Stephanopolous?

233
00:13:55,319 --> 00:13:56,991
Oh, man.
My dad's gonna kill me!

234
00:13:57,238 --> 00:13:58,148
Wait!

235
00:13:58,397 --> 00:13:59,750
Did you say. . .

236
00:13:59,997 --> 00:14:01,555
. . .G. Stephanopolous?

237
00:14:01,796 --> 00:14:04,356
It goes across the street.
I gave him yours.

238
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:06,551
Bonehead! Bonehead!

239
00:14:07,274 --> 00:14:11,950
Was this a small Mediterranean guy
with curiously intelligent good looks?

240
00:14:12,792 --> 00:14:14,145
That sounds about right.

241
00:14:14,391 --> 00:14:16,746
Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?

242
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,264
And a power tie?

243
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:20,742
No, pretty much just a towel.

244
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:22,502
Oh, God!

245
00:14:23,748 --> 00:14:24,863
Want me to take this back?

246
00:14:25,107 --> 00:14:28,782
Are you nuts? We've got
George Stephanopolous' pizza!

247
00:14:34,943 --> 00:14:36,342
Who's George Snuffleupagus?

248
00:14:38,942 --> 00:14:40,261
That's Big Bird's friend.

249
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,330
I see pizza!

250
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,536
I wanna see. Let me see.

251
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:48,656
Hello! Who are we spying on?

252
00:14:48,898 --> 00:14:51,890
You know, the White House adviser?
Clinton's campaign guy.

253
00:14:52,137 --> 00:14:55,334
The one with the great hair,
sexy smile, really cute butt.

254
00:14:55,575 --> 00:14:59,090
Oh, him! The little guy.
Oh, I love him!

255
00:15:00,254 --> 00:15:02,529
Wait. Wait, I see a woman.

256
00:15:02,773 --> 00:15:04,684
Tell me it's his mother.

257
00:15:04,932 --> 00:15:07,492
-Definitely not his mother.
-Oh, no!

258
00:15:07,691 --> 00:15:09,602
She's walking across the floor.

259
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,410
She's walking, she's walking.

260
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:16,085
She's going for the pizza.
Hey, that's not for you, bitch!

261
00:15:30,282 --> 00:15:31,078
Excuse me?

262
00:15:31,322 --> 00:15:35,031
We've been here for over an hour,
and people less sick have gone in.

263
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,312
That guy with the toe thing?
Who's he sleeping with?

264
00:15:41,478 --> 00:15:44,038
Oh, come on, Dora.
Don't be mad.

265
00:15:44,237 --> 00:15:46,671
I know we both said some things. . .

266
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:49,309
. . .we didn't mean. . .

267
00:15:49,555 --> 00:15:52,274
. . .but that doesn't mean
we still don't love each other.

268
00:15:53,073 --> 00:15:55,587
You know, I feel like I've lost her.

269
00:15:59,431 --> 00:16:00,864
Lights still out?

270
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,662
Maybe they're napping.

271
00:16:04,269 --> 00:16:06,100
Please. They're having sex.

272
00:16:06,348 --> 00:16:07,701
Shut up!

273
00:16:12,946 --> 00:16:15,904
So what do you think George is like?

274
00:16:16,144 --> 00:16:17,657
I think he's shy.

275
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:21,059
I think you have to draw him out.

276
00:16:21,262 --> 00:16:22,741
And then when you do. . .

277
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,052
. . .he's a preppy animal.

278
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:31,695
I remember the moonlight came in. . .

279
00:16:31,938 --> 00:16:34,771
. . .through the open window,
and her face had the most. . .

280
00:16:35,017 --> 00:16:36,291
. . .incredible glow.

281
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:39,688
Yes, the moon, the glow,
the magical feeling.

282
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:43,450
You did this part. Could I get
some painkillers over here, please?

283
00:16:44,493 --> 00:16:48,008
He's right, enough already.
What is the big deal about today?

284
00:16:48,212 --> 00:16:49,964
So you slept with her
for the first time.

285
00:16:50,211 --> 00:16:53,283
So what? You slept with her
for seven years after that.

286
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,880
It's a little more complicated
than that.

287
00:16:57,129 --> 00:17:01,759
Is it that she left you? That she
left you for a woman that likes women?

288
00:17:02,007 --> 00:17:06,159
Louder. There's a man on the 1 2th
floor in a coma who didn't hear you.

289
00:17:09,684 --> 00:17:10,719
Then what?

290
00:17:11,803 --> 00:17:13,839
My first time with Carol was. . .

291
00:17:14,642 --> 00:17:15,836
. . .was my. . . .

292
00:17:17,881 --> 00:17:19,075
What?

293
00:17:21,479 --> 00:17:23,674
It was my first. . .

294
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:25,637
. . .time.

295
00:17:26,677 --> 00:17:27,507
With Carol?

296
00:17:34,994 --> 00:17:38,225
So in your whole life,
you've only been with one. . .?

297
00:17:39,912 --> 00:17:43,029
Oh, boy. Hockey was a big mistake.

298
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,385
There's a lot of stuff
we could've done tonight.

299
00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:50,462
Okay, I got one.

300
00:17:51,508 --> 00:17:54,261
Do you remember that vegetarian pâté. . .

301
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:57,020
. . .that I made that you loved so much?

302
00:17:58,505 --> 00:18:01,417
Well, unless goose is a vegetable!

303
00:18:05,022 --> 00:18:08,981
Okay, fine. Now I don't feel so bad
about sleeping with Jason Hurley.

304
00:18:09,461 --> 00:18:11,292
What? You slept with Jason?

305
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,973
You'd already broken up.

306
00:18:13,219 --> 00:18:14,413
How long?

307
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:15,535
A couple hours.

308
00:18:15,858 --> 00:18:17,655
Oh, that's nice!

309
00:18:17,857 --> 00:18:19,813
Okay, okay, I got one!

310
00:18:22,176 --> 00:18:23,052
Anyway. . . .

311
00:18:23,295 --> 00:18:26,890
The valentine Tom left
in your locker was really from me!

312
00:18:27,494 --> 00:18:28,483
Excuse me?

313
00:18:29,493 --> 00:18:32,644
Hello! Like he was really
gonna send you one.

314
00:18:35,011 --> 00:18:37,047
She was a big girl!

315
00:18:38,889 --> 00:18:41,323
Really? Well, at least. . .

316
00:18:41,568 --> 00:18:44,799
. . .big girls don't pee in
their pants in seventh grade!

317
00:18:45,047 --> 00:18:47,641
I was laughing. You made me laugh!

318
00:18:47,886 --> 00:18:50,036
Oh, my God! There he is!
There he is!

319
00:18:50,565 --> 00:18:53,398
-Where?
-Where we've been looking all night.

320
00:18:54,044 --> 00:18:57,002
-Oh, he's so cute.
-George, baby, drop the towel.

321
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:58,999
Come on, drop the towel.

322
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:10,989
Man, can you believe he's
only had sex with one woman?

323
00:19:11,997 --> 00:19:13,396
I think it's great.

324
00:19:13,676 --> 00:19:15,348
You know, it's sweet.

325
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,593
It's romantic.

326
00:19:18,794 --> 00:19:19,590
Really?

327
00:19:19,834 --> 00:19:22,792
No, you kidding? The guy's a freak.
I judge him.

328
00:19:23,272 --> 00:19:24,785
Hey, buddy!

329
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,822
That's attractive.

330
00:19:33,828 --> 00:19:36,581
I thought you were great
in Silence of the Lambs.

331
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:42,183
Admit it, all things considered,
you had fun tonight.

332
00:19:42,425 --> 00:19:46,054
Where was the fun? Tell me specifically
which part was the fun part?

333
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,134
Where's my puck?

334
00:19:48,383 --> 00:19:50,180
-The kid has it.
-The kid?

335
00:19:51,581 --> 00:19:54,015
Excuse me, that's my puck.

336
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,696
I found it. Finders keepers,
losers weepers.

337
00:20:01,058 --> 00:20:02,776
You gotta do it, man.

338
00:20:03,977 --> 00:20:06,775
Oh, yeah? I'm rubber, you're glue.
Whatever you--

339
00:20:07,015 --> 00:20:08,368
I can't do it.

340
00:20:09,055 --> 00:20:11,774
Listen, give me back my puck.

341
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:13,163
Yes, how about it.

342
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:15,608
Come here.
Give me my puck.

343
00:20:15,852 --> 00:20:17,410
No roughhousing in my ER!

344
00:20:17,651 --> 00:20:19,004
Give me my puck!

345
00:20:24,209 --> 00:20:26,165
Now that was fun.

346
00:20:34,645 --> 00:20:37,079
Right foot, red.

347
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:40,356
Could've played Monopoly, but no!

348
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,749
Thanks.

00:20:55,437 --> 00:20:56,586
Right hand, blue.

350
00:20:59,235 --> 00:21:00,554
Good.

351
00:21:08,032 --> 00:21:09,704
It's the VISA-card people.

352
00:21:10,111 --> 00:21:11,624
Will you take my place?

353
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,707
All right. Yes, this is Rachel.

354
00:21:18,828 --> 00:21:22,377
No, I know. I haven't been
using it much.

355
00:21:22,586 --> 00:21:25,976
Well, thanks.
But I'm okay, really.

356
00:21:26,265 --> 00:21:27,539
To the green.

357
00:21:28,904 --> 00:21:30,940
I've got magic beans.

358
00:21:33,382 --> 00:21:34,781
No, never mind.

359
00:21:35,021 --> 00:21:36,534
To the left! To the left!

360
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,538
I'm fine.
