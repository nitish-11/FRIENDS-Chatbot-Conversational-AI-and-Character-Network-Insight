1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,117
How'd someone get
your credit card number?

2
00:00:03,356 --> 00:00:05,665
I have no idea.
Look how much they spent!

3
00:00:05,911 --> 00:00:09,460
Calm down. You only have to pay
for the stuff you bought.

4
00:00:09,704 --> 00:00:12,264
Still, it's just
such reckless spending.

5
00:00:12,458 --> 00:00:14,289
When somebody steals
your credit card. . .

6
00:00:14,534 --> 00:00:17,332
. . .they've kind of already
thrown caution to the wind.

7
00:00:20,443 --> 00:00:25,233
Wow, what a geek.
They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.

8
00:00:26,631 --> 00:00:27,825
That's me.

9
00:00:33,178 --> 00:00:34,611
He's doing it again!

10
00:00:34,815 --> 00:00:36,851
Marcel, stop humping the lamp!

11
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,320
Stop humping!
Now, Marcel, come back!

12
00:00:39,566 --> 00:00:40,521
Come here, Marcel!

13
00:00:40,763 --> 00:00:42,993
Oh, no, no! Not in my room!
I'II get him.

14
00:00:43,638 --> 00:00:45,993
You've got to do something
about the humping.

15
00:00:46,193 --> 00:00:48,184
What? It's just a phase.

16
00:00:48,628 --> 00:00:51,096
Well, that's what we said about Joey.

17
00:00:53,459 --> 00:00:56,417
Hey, would you all relax?
It's not that big a deal.

18
00:00:56,652 --> 00:00:58,802
Marcel, stop it! Marcel!
Bad monkey!

19
00:00:59,327 --> 00:01:00,282
What?

20
00:01:00,804 --> 00:01:04,080
Let's just say my Curious George doll
is no longer curious.

21
00:01:07,392 --> 00:01:09,508
The One With the Fake Monica

22
00:01:10,785 --> 00:01:11,774
English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

23
00:01:54,021 --> 00:01:56,899
Monica, you are not still
going over that thing.

24
00:01:57,135 --> 00:01:59,729
-This woman's living my life.
-What?

25
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,639
She's Living my Life,
and she's doing it better than me.

26
00:02:04,241 --> 00:02:06,038
Look at this. Look.

27
00:02:06,437 --> 00:02:08,667
She buys tickets to plays
I want to see.

28
00:02:09,032 --> 00:02:12,104
She shops at stores that
I'm intimidated by the salespeople.

29
00:02:12,306 --> 00:02:14,866
She spent $300 on art supplies.

30
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,209
You're not an artist.

31
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:19,018
Yeah, well, I might be
if I had the supplies.

32
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:24,089
I mean, I could do all this stuff.
Only I don't.

33
00:02:24,682 --> 00:02:26,991
Oh, Monica, come on.
You do cool things.

34
00:02:27,197 --> 00:02:29,233
Oh, really?
Let's compare, shall we?

35
00:02:29,472 --> 00:02:32,384
Oh, it's so late for ''shall we. ''

36
00:02:33,465 --> 00:02:35,501
Do I go horseback riding
in the park?

37
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,373
Do I take classes at The New School?

38
00:02:40,251 --> 00:02:41,570
This is so unfair.

39
00:02:41,808 --> 00:02:45,005
She's got everything I want,
and she doesn't have my mother.

40
00:02:53,027 --> 00:02:55,143
How about Joey Paponi?

41
00:02:55,422 --> 00:02:56,901
No, still too ethnic.

42
00:02:57,338 --> 00:03:00,136
My agent thinks I should have
a name that's more neutral.

43
00:03:00,332 --> 00:03:01,208
Joey Switzerland?

44
00:03:06,001 --> 00:03:10,153
Plus I think it should be Joe.
Joey makes me sound like I'm. . .

45
00:03:10,393 --> 00:03:11,428
. . .this big.

46
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,739
Which I'm not!

47
00:03:15,184 --> 00:03:18,381
Joe, Joe, Joe. . . .
Stalin?

48
00:03:20,094 --> 00:03:21,368
Stalin.

49
00:03:22,529 --> 00:03:24,918
Do I know that name?
That sounds familiar.

50
00:03:25,284 --> 00:03:27,878
Well, it does not
ring a bell with me.

51
00:03:28,757 --> 00:03:31,066
Joe Stalin.

52
00:03:33,907 --> 00:03:35,659
You know, that's pretty good.

53
00:03:36,303 --> 00:03:38,259
You might want to try Joseph.

54
00:03:44,407 --> 00:03:46,045
Joseph Stalin!

55
00:03:47,321 --> 00:03:49,437
-I think you'd remember that!
-Oh, yes!

56
00:03:51,194 --> 00:03:53,708
Bye Bye Birdie,
starring Joseph Stalin.

57
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:57,219
Joseph Stalin is
The Fiddler on the Roof!.

58
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:12,392
Hi. Yes, this is Monica Geller.

59
00:04:12,592 --> 00:04:16,267
I'm taking classes with you,
and I was wondering what they were.

60
00:04:18,421 --> 00:04:19,854
What are you doing?

61
00:04:20,217 --> 00:04:21,366
AII right, great.

62
00:04:21,575 --> 00:04:23,088
Great. Thanks a lot.

63
00:04:23,771 --> 00:04:25,363
I'm going to tap class.

64
00:04:25,567 --> 00:04:28,559
So you can dance with the woman
that stole your card?

65
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:30,996
She's got my Life.
I want to see who she is.

66
00:04:31,236 --> 00:04:34,353
Go to the post office!
I'm sure her picture's up!

67
00:04:35,228 --> 00:04:37,344
Honey, you're kind of losing it here.

68
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:40,058
This is really becoming
a weird obsession.

69
00:04:40,418 --> 00:04:42,215
This is madness, I tell you.

70
00:04:42,414 --> 00:04:45,326
For the love of God, Monica,
don't do it!

71
00:04:47,884 --> 00:04:49,033
Thank you.

72
00:04:56,747 --> 00:04:57,941
What do you think?

73
00:04:58,463 --> 00:04:59,737
Lots of things.

74
00:05:01,338 --> 00:05:02,976
Which one do you think she is?

75
00:05:03,174 --> 00:05:04,732
-May I help you?
-No, thanks.

76
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,529
We're just here to observe.

77
00:05:06,767 --> 00:05:10,476
You don't observe a dance class.
You dance a dance class!

78
00:05:10,719 --> 00:05:12,675
Spare shoes are over there.

79
00:05:15,111 --> 00:05:16,305
What does she mean?

80
00:05:16,508 --> 00:05:18,339
I think she means, ''You dance. . .

81
00:05:18,544 --> 00:05:20,023
. . .a dance class! ''

82
00:05:20,221 --> 00:05:21,939
Come on, come on, come on!

83
00:05:22,137 --> 00:05:23,047
Really?

84
00:05:24,054 --> 00:05:26,488
Hey, do you see anybody
you think could be me?

85
00:05:26,728 --> 00:05:31,244
People, last time there were yogurt
containers lying around after class.

86
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:33,117
Let's not have that happen again!

87
00:05:33,835 --> 00:05:35,427
She could be you.

88
00:05:40,063 --> 00:05:41,178
Let's get started.

89
00:05:41,899 --> 00:05:45,096
Five, six.
Five, six, seven, eight.

90
00:05:50,163 --> 00:05:51,915
Okay, I'm not getting this!

91
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:54,629
I'm totally getting it!

92
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:02,615
Do you ever just feel Like you're
so unbelievably uncoordinated?

93
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:12,160
What? You just click
when they click.

94
00:06:13,997 --> 00:06:16,306
AII right.
Now everyone grab a partner.

95
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:22,904
AII right. And my dead mother
said you are it! I'm with Rachel.

96
00:06:23,378 --> 00:06:25,846
Great, it's gym class all over again.

97
00:06:28,049 --> 00:06:31,678
That's all right. You can come up
to the front and dance with me.

98
00:06:32,401 --> 00:06:35,711
Why don't I just take off my clothes
and have a nightmare?

99
00:06:40,745 --> 00:06:45,216
It's okay, it's okay! I'm here,
I'm here. I'm so sorry I'm Late.

100
00:06:45,456 --> 00:06:46,525
Okay, here I am.

101
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:49,162
So who's the new tense girl?

102
00:06:49,648 --> 00:06:50,717
She's your partner.

103
00:06:50,965 --> 00:06:52,637
Hi, I'm Monica.

104
00:06:57,951 --> 00:06:59,589
Hi, I'm Mon--

105
00:06:59,788 --> 00:07:00,584
Nana.

106
00:07:00,826 --> 00:07:02,020
Monana.

107
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:04,975
It's Dutch.

108
00:07:05,297 --> 00:07:08,414
You're kidding.
I spent three years in Amsterdam.

109
00:07:12,004 --> 00:07:13,915
Pennsylvania Dutch.

110
00:07:15,198 --> 00:07:16,551
And we're dancing!

111
00:07:16,795 --> 00:07:18,911
Five, six, seven, eight.

112
00:07:30,808 --> 00:07:33,880
-Where have you been?
-I just got back from the vet.

113
00:07:34,081 --> 00:07:37,391
She's not gonna make you wear
a big plastic cone, is she?

114
00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:43,381
She says Marcel’s humping
thing is not a phase.

115
00:07:43,623 --> 00:07:46,615
Apparently, he's reached
sexual maturity.

116
00:07:47,415 --> 00:07:49,565
Hey, he beat you!

117
00:07:53,164 --> 00:07:57,954
She says, as time goes on, he'll
start getting aggressive and violent.

118
00:07:58,394 --> 00:07:59,509
What does this mean?

119
00:08:01,827 --> 00:08:03,180
I have to give him up.

120
00:08:19,872 --> 00:08:22,591
I can't believe it. This sucks!

121
00:08:22,827 --> 00:08:26,137
You just got him.
How could he be an adult already?

122
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,338
I know, I know.
One day he's this little thing. . .

123
00:08:29,534 --> 00:08:32,253
. . .and before you know it,
he's this Little thing. . .

124
00:08:32,448 --> 00:08:34,484
. . .I can't get off my leg.

125
00:08:36,281 --> 00:08:38,511
Isn't there any way you can keep him?

126
00:08:38,716 --> 00:08:41,708
The vet said that
unless he's in a place. . .

127
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:44,265
. . .where he has regular access. . .

128
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,060
. . .to some monkey loving. . .

129
00:08:48,058 --> 00:08:50,049
. . .he's just gonna get vicious.

130
00:08:50,293 --> 00:08:52,853
I just gotta get him into a zoo.

131
00:08:54,685 --> 00:08:57,324
-How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
-I know that one!

132
00:09:01,631 --> 00:09:04,429
No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.

133
00:09:06,103 --> 00:09:10,255
We're applying to a Lot of them.
Our first choice would be a state zoo.

134
00:09:10,494 --> 00:09:12,803
You know, Like San Diego.

135
00:09:13,688 --> 00:09:14,564
Right?

136
00:09:15,445 --> 00:09:19,358
But that may just be a pipe dream
because he's out-of-state.

137
00:09:21,553 --> 00:09:25,671
My vet knows someone at Miami,
so that's a possibility.

138
00:09:25,904 --> 00:09:29,214
But that's two blocks from the beach.
It's a total party zoo.

139
00:09:35,526 --> 00:09:36,800
We found the girl!

140
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,362
-What?
-Did you call the cops?

141
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,033
Nope. We took her to lunch.

142
00:09:40,276 --> 00:09:42,836
Your own brand of vigilante justice.

143
00:09:44,109 --> 00:09:47,101
Are you insane?
This woman stole from you!

144
00:09:47,303 --> 00:09:49,658
She stole!
She's a stealer!

145
00:09:50,576 --> 00:09:54,330
After you're with this woman
for 1 0 minutes, you forget all that.

146
00:09:55,367 --> 00:09:57,722
I mean, she's this
astounding person. . .

147
00:09:57,962 --> 00:09:59,918
. . .with this amazing spirit!

148
00:10:00,118 --> 00:10:03,110
Yeah, which she probably stole
from some cheerleader!

149
00:10:05,388 --> 00:10:07,538
-Take off their hats.
-Popes in a Volkswagen!

150
00:10:10,937 --> 00:10:12,609
I Love that joke.

151
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:20,683
-No way! No way did you do this!
-Monana was very brave.

152
00:10:21,516 --> 00:10:22,665
It was so wild.

153
00:10:22,874 --> 00:10:25,672
We told them we were
the Gunnersons in room 61 5. . .

154
00:10:25,908 --> 00:10:29,457
. . .only to find out the Boston Celtics
had the entire sixth floor!

155
00:10:29,661 --> 00:10:32,971
So when they caught on that
we were short and have breasts. . . .

156
00:10:33,653 --> 00:10:36,929
They threw us out.
I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!

157
00:10:37,525 --> 00:10:39,083
Go, Monana!

158
00:10:41,318 --> 00:10:44,674
Well, you ladies are not
the only ones Living the dream.

159
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:49,462
I get to go pour coffee for people
I don't know. Don't wait up.

160
00:10:51,538 --> 00:10:52,732
Oh, by the way. . .

161
00:10:52,975 --> 00:10:56,012
. . .tomorrow we're auditioning
for a Broadway show.

162
00:10:57,527 --> 00:10:58,323
Excuse me?

163
00:10:58,565 --> 00:11:00,237
There's an open call for Cats.

164
00:11:00,481 --> 00:11:03,075
I'm thinking we go down there,
sing ''Memories'' . . .

165
00:11:03,275 --> 00:11:06,984
. . .and make complete fools
of ourselves. What do you say?

166
00:11:09,384 --> 00:11:11,739
Remember who you're dealing with here.

167
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:14,897
I'm not Like you. I can't even
stand in front of a tap class.

168
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,043
That's because of
your Amish background.

169
00:11:19,963 --> 00:11:21,954
You're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?

170
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,148
Right.

171
00:11:23,356 --> 00:11:26,428
Till I bought a blow dryer.
Then I was shunt.

172
00:11:28,427 --> 00:11:29,780
I was just Like you.

173
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:33,698
And then one day, I saw a movie
that changed my Life.

174
00:11:34,295 --> 00:11:36,604
Did you ever see
Dead Poet's Society?

175
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:40,479
I thought that movie was
so incredibly. . .

176
00:11:40,683 --> 00:11:41,479
. . .boring!

177
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,714
I mean, that thing at the end
where the kid. . .

178
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,514
. . .kills himself because
he can't be in the play?

179
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:48,744
What was that?

180
00:11:48,987 --> 00:11:53,344
It's Like, ''Kid, wait a year. Leave
home, do some community theater! ''

181
00:11:55,574 --> 00:11:57,087
As I walked out, I thought. . .

182
00:11:57,291 --> 00:12:01,569
. . . ''Now that's two hours of my Life
that I'm never getting back! ''

183
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:05,954
And that scared me more than all
the other crap I was afraid to do!

184
00:12:06,233 --> 00:12:10,465
Wow. Then I would definitely
not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.

185
00:12:17,052 --> 00:12:18,280
Oh, God.

186
00:12:19,967 --> 00:12:22,162
We didn't get into Scranton.

187
00:12:24,198 --> 00:12:26,837
That was our safety zoo.

188
00:12:27,712 --> 00:12:30,704
They take, Like, dogs and cows.

189
00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:37,530
I don't know who this
is harder on, me or him.

190
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:41,044
I'd say that chair's
taking the brunt of it.

191
00:12:47,872 --> 00:12:49,305
Good boy!

192
00:12:49,749 --> 00:12:51,580
See? How can nobody want him?

193
00:12:51,785 --> 00:12:53,457
Somebody will.

194
00:12:56,456 --> 00:12:58,890
You know, there already is
a Joseph Stalin?

195
00:13:04,001 --> 00:13:04,990
You're kidding!

196
00:13:06,357 --> 00:13:11,272
Apparently, he was a Russian dictator
who slaughtered all these people!

197
00:13:12,305 --> 00:13:15,342
-You'd think you would’ve known that!
-You'd think I would’ve.

198
00:13:17,974 --> 00:13:21,853
Phoebe, what do you think a good
stage name for me would be?

199
00:13:23,643 --> 00:13:24,996
Flame Boy!

200
00:13:32,346 --> 00:13:33,938
Where exactly is your zoo?

201
00:13:34,183 --> 00:13:36,743
Well, it's technically
not a zoo per se.

202
00:13:36,977 --> 00:13:40,890
It's more of an interactive-
wildlife experience.

203
00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:44,081
Let me ask you some questions about--
Is it Marcel?

204
00:13:45,121 --> 00:13:47,510
Does he fight with other animals?

205
00:13:47,716 --> 00:13:49,672
No, no. He's very docile.

206
00:13:50,551 --> 00:13:52,985
Even if he were cornered?

207
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,175
Well, I don't know. Why?

208
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:01,328
How is he at handling small objects?

209
00:14:02,528 --> 00:14:05,042
He can hold a banana,
if that's what you mean.

210
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,993
What about a hammer
or a small blade?

211
00:14:12,907 --> 00:14:15,102
Why would he need a blade?

212
00:14:15,343 --> 00:14:18,255
If he's up against a jungle cat
or an animal with horns. . .

213
00:14:18,497 --> 00:14:21,057
. . .you've got to give
the Little guy something.

214
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:22,809
Otherwise, it's just cruel!

215
00:14:25,603 --> 00:14:27,673
He got into San Diego!

216
00:14:27,918 --> 00:14:28,794
What?

217
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:32,346
We were coming back from our walk,
and the phone was ringing. . . .

218
00:14:32,549 --> 00:14:33,459
He's in!

219
00:14:34,266 --> 00:14:35,779
Did you hear that, Marcel?

220
00:14:36,023 --> 00:14:38,821
It's San Diego! San Diego!

221
00:14:39,017 --> 00:14:41,850
You're making a mistake.
San Diego's well and good. . .

222
00:14:42,091 --> 00:14:45,401
. . .but if you give him to me, I'II
start him against a blind rabbit. . .

223
00:14:45,604 --> 00:14:47,356
. . .and give you 20% of the gate.

224
00:15:07,921 --> 00:15:08,910
Where have you been?

225
00:15:09,518 --> 00:15:12,316
Monica and I just crashed
an embassy party.

226
00:15:12,991 --> 00:15:14,219
Are you drunk?

227
00:15:14,707 --> 00:15:15,662
No!

228
00:15:20,496 --> 00:15:21,565
I'm Lying.

229
00:15:21,894 --> 00:15:23,930
I am so drunk!

230
00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:25,198
Oh, God!

231
00:15:25,726 --> 00:15:28,035
Great. You know what?
You could have called.

232
00:15:28,441 --> 00:15:30,477
I've been up here.
I've been worried--

233
00:15:36,705 --> 00:15:38,502
Water rules!

234
00:15:41,615 --> 00:15:43,446
Yes. Yes, it does.

235
00:15:43,691 --> 00:15:47,604
The restaurant called. They want
to know if you're showing up.

236
00:15:48,003 --> 00:15:49,038
Nope!

237
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,670
I'm going to the
Big Apple Circus today.

238
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:55,664
What are you doing? You're gonna
lose your job. This is not you!

239
00:15:55,908 --> 00:15:57,580
No, it is me!

240
00:15:57,824 --> 00:16:00,816
I'm not just the person
who needs to fluff the pillows. . .

241
00:16:01,058 --> 00:16:03,174
. . .and pay the bills
as soon as they come in!

242
00:16:03,373 --> 00:16:08,003
You know, when I'm with her,
I'm so much more than that!

243
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:12,517
I'm Monana!

244
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,655
Yes, she is.
Hold on a second, please.

245
00:16:22,935 --> 00:16:24,846
Monana, it's for you.

246
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,327
The credit card people.

247
00:16:34,153 --> 00:16:35,472
Oh, my God!

248
00:16:36,908 --> 00:16:37,897
Thanks.

249
00:16:39,144 --> 00:16:39,940
What?

250
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,856
They've arrested Monica.

251
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:57,270
How are you?

252
00:16:57,468 --> 00:16:59,902
I'm not too bad.
Fortunately, blue’s my color.

253
00:17:01,261 --> 00:17:03,297
How did you know I was here?

254
00:17:04,534 --> 00:17:05,762
Because. . .

255
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,881
. . .I'm Monica Geller.

256
00:17:09,525 --> 00:17:11,959
It was my credit card you were using.

257
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,435
That I was not expecting.

258
00:17:14,715 --> 00:17:17,070
I want you to know,
I didn't turn you in.

259
00:17:19,106 --> 00:17:21,825
-Thanks.
-No, thank you.

260
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,495
You have given me so much.

261
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,691
Without you,
I'd have never gotten. . .

262
00:17:26,891 --> 00:17:29,280
. . .to sing ''Memories''
at the Wintergarden Theater.

263
00:17:29,606 --> 00:17:31,517
Actually, you only got
to sing ''Memo--''

264
00:17:33,838 --> 00:17:37,547
I can't believe you're in here.
What am I gonna do without you?

265
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:40,219
Who's gonna crash
the embassy parties with me?

266
00:17:40,425 --> 00:17:42,495
Who's gonna take me
to the Big Apple Circus?

267
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:47,332
Monica, I started my day by peeing
in front of 25 other women. . .

268
00:17:47,571 --> 00:17:51,610
. . .and you're worried about who will
take you to the Big Apple Circus?

269
00:17:52,841 --> 00:17:56,311
Well, not worried,
you know, just wondering.

270
00:17:56,553 --> 00:17:58,783
There's nothing to wonder about.

271
00:17:59,029 --> 00:18:02,578
You'll go back to being who you were
because that's who you are.

272
00:18:03,221 --> 00:18:05,371
-Not necessarily.
-Yes, necessarily.

273
00:18:05,815 --> 00:18:08,283
I don't know what it is.
Maybe it's the Amish thing.

274
00:18:12,403 --> 00:18:14,155
I'm not actually Amish.

275
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,748
Really?
Then why are you Like that?

276
00:18:32,204 --> 00:18:33,717
You by the door, in or out?

277
00:18:35,717 --> 00:18:36,593
In!

278
00:18:42,185 --> 00:18:43,982
You in the back,
you're getting it wrong!

279
00:18:44,221 --> 00:18:45,973
At least I'm doing it!

280
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:03,859
This is the final boarding call
for Flight 67 to San Diego...

281
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:06,172
...boarding at gate 42A.

282
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,574
Okay, goodbye, Little monkey guy.

283
00:19:08,813 --> 00:19:10,804
AII right, I wrote you this poem.

284
00:19:12,127 --> 00:19:14,800
Okay, but don't eat it
till you get on the plane.

285
00:19:15,001 --> 00:19:16,753
Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.

286
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,587
Okay, bye, champ.

287
00:19:23,185 --> 00:19:25,824
There's gonna be a Lot
of babes in San Diego. . .

288
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,938
. . .but remember,
there's also a Lot to learn.

289
00:19:35,082 --> 00:19:38,199
I don't know what to say.
It's a monkey.

290
00:19:38,675 --> 00:19:40,984
Just say what you feel.

291
00:19:42,827 --> 00:19:44,340
Marcel, I'm hungry.

292
00:19:45,422 --> 00:19:46,218
That was good.

293
00:19:49,335 --> 00:19:51,565
Marcel, this is for you.

294
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,517
It's just, you know, something. . .

295
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,158
. . .to do on the plane.

296
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:03,824
If you don't mind, I'd Like
a moment, just me and him.

297
00:20:04,066 --> 00:20:06,534
-Oh, sure. Absolutely.
-Go ahead.

298
00:20:11,571 --> 00:20:13,687
Marcel, come here.
Come here.

299
00:20:14,486 --> 00:20:15,362
Come here.

300
00:20:16,163 --> 00:20:17,516
Well, buddy. . .

301
00:20:19,596 --> 00:20:20,915
. . .this is it.

302
00:20:21,273 --> 00:20:24,106
There's just a couple of things
I wanted to say.

303
00:20:25,504 --> 00:20:27,699
I'm really gonna miss you.

304
00:20:28,179 --> 00:20:31,091
You know, I'm never gonna
forget about you.

305
00:20:31,293 --> 00:20:33,682
You've been more than. . .

306
00:20:33,928 --> 00:20:35,486
. . .just a pet to me.

307
00:20:36,124 --> 00:20:38,080
You've been more Like a--

308
00:20:40,515 --> 00:20:42,471
Would you leave my Leg alone?

309
00:20:42,671 --> 00:20:45,663
Would you just stop humping me
for two seconds?

310
00:20:46,344 --> 00:20:49,541
Okay, would you just take him away?
Just take him.

311
00:21:12,493 --> 00:21:16,452
O, that I were a glove upon
that hand that I might. . .

312
00:21:16,685 --> 00:21:18,437
. . .touch thy cheek!

313
00:21:18,641 --> 00:21:21,235
That's fine. Thank you.

314
00:21:21,476 --> 00:21:22,670
Next.

315
00:21:26,825 --> 00:21:29,385
I'II be reading
for the role of Mercutio.

316
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,088
-Name?
-Holden McGroin.
