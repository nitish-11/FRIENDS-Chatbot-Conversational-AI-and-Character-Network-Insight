1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,356
I'm teIIing you, she wants you.

2
00:00:04,598 --> 00:00:07,237
She bareIy knows me.
We just Iive in the same buiIding.

3
00:00:07,476 --> 00:00:08,272
Any contact?

4
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:09,703
She lent me an egg once.

5
00:00:09,914 --> 00:00:11,063
You're in!

6
00:00:12,113 --> 00:00:13,592
Oh, right.

7
00:00:21,385 --> 00:00:23,945
Come on. You gotta get back
in the game here.

8
00:00:24,183 --> 00:00:28,142
The Rachel thing's not happening,
your ex-wife's a lesbian, you. . . .

9
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:30,856
I don't think we need a third.

10
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:34,170
Excuse me. Could we get an egg
still in the shell?

11
00:00:34,575 --> 00:00:35,371
An egg?

12
00:00:35,614 --> 00:00:40,290
Go up to her and say, ''Here's your
egg back. I'm returning your egg. ''

13
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,408
I think it's winning!

14
00:00:43,288 --> 00:00:44,323
I think it's insane.

15
00:00:44,567 --> 00:00:45,363
She'll love it!

16
00:00:46,766 --> 00:00:49,360
-Thank you.
-Thank you. Here.

17
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:54,238
Go with the egg, my friend.

18
00:00:56,558 --> 00:00:58,833
Go, go, go!

19
00:01:00,755 --> 00:01:03,872
-Think it'll work?
-It's suicide. The man's got an egg.

20
00:01:04,432 --> 00:01:06,468
The One With the Candy Hearts

22
00:01:52,515 --> 00:01:54,506
-You cannot do this.
-What? Do what?

23
00:01:54,753 --> 00:01:56,232
Roger wants to take her out.

24
00:01:56,432 --> 00:01:59,344
No! Pheebs! Don't you remember
why you dumped the guy?

25
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:01,422
Because he was creepy.

26
00:02:02,387 --> 00:02:04,218
And mean. And a little frightening.

27
00:02:04,466 --> 00:02:06,900
Still, it's nice to have
a date on Valentine's Day!

28
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:11,776
You can go out with a creep
any night of the year.

29
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,648
I know I do.

30
00:02:17,056 --> 00:02:18,614
What are you doing tomorrow night?

31
00:02:18,815 --> 00:02:21,613
Actually, tomorrow night
depends on how tonight goes.

32
00:02:21,852 --> 00:02:25,242
-Listen, about tonight--
-Don't you dare bail on me!

33
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,800
She's only going out with me because
I'm bringing a friend for her friend.

34
00:02:29,007 --> 00:02:30,804
But her friend sounds like such a--

35
00:02:31,045 --> 00:02:33,161
Pathetic mess. I know, but. . . .

36
00:02:33,683 --> 00:02:36,197
Come on, man, she's needy,
she's vulnerable.

37
00:02:36,401 --> 00:02:37,993
I'm thinking. . . .

38
00:02:42,676 --> 00:02:43,506
Thanks.

39
00:02:44,475 --> 00:02:48,070
You haven't been out with a woman
since Janice. You're doing this.

40
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,179
She said yes.

41
00:02:52,869 --> 00:02:54,507
Way to go, man!

42
00:02:55,866 --> 00:02:57,777
Still got the egg, huh?

43
00:03:10,735 --> 00:03:11,724
How do I look?

44
00:03:13,053 --> 00:03:14,372
I don't care.

45
00:03:18,249 --> 00:03:19,284
There's Lorraine.

46
00:03:19,528 --> 00:03:21,200
Now, remember, no trading.

47
00:03:21,446 --> 00:03:23,641
You get the pretty one.
I get the mess.

48
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:29,920
Well, well!

49
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,678
Look what you brought!

50
00:03:31,918 --> 00:03:33,317
Very nice.

51
00:03:34,357 --> 00:03:36,188
And what did you bring?

52
00:03:37,834 --> 00:03:39,472
She's checking her coat.

53
00:03:39,712 --> 00:03:42,863
I'm gonna go wash the cab smell
off of my hands.

54
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:46,739
Will you get me a white zinfandel
and a glass of red for Janice?

55
00:03:51,423 --> 00:03:52,253
Janice?

56
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:57,968
Oh. . .

57
00:03:58,218 --> 00:03:59,367
. . .my. . .

58
00:03:59,617 --> 00:04:00,766
. . .God!

59
00:04:04,613 --> 00:04:06,205
Hey, it's Janice!

60
00:04:12,607 --> 00:04:15,041
I'm making a break for it!
I'm going out the window!

61
00:04:15,285 --> 00:04:19,722
No, don't, please! I've been waiting
for forever to go out with Lorraine!

62
00:04:19,921 --> 00:04:22,037
-Just calm down.
-Calm down? Calm down?

63
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,114
You set me up with a woman I've dumped
twice in the last five months!

64
00:04:27,356 --> 00:04:30,746
Can you stop yelling?
You're making me nervous. . .

65
00:04:33,991 --> 00:04:36,107
. . .and I can't go when I'm nervous.

66
00:04:36,668 --> 00:04:38,704
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right.

67
00:04:42,384 --> 00:04:45,501
Come on! Do it, do it, do it!
Come on!

68
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,689
Okay, Roger was creepy, but he was
nothing compared to Pete Carney.

69
00:04:50,937 --> 00:04:52,734
-Which one was he?
-Pete the Weeper?

70
00:04:52,976 --> 00:04:56,491
Remember the guy that used to cry
every time we had sex?

71
00:04:56,973 --> 00:04:59,362
''Oh, was it good for you?''

72
00:05:01,409 --> 00:05:05,482
Well, I'd take a little crying
any day over Howard, the ''I win'' guy!

73
00:05:05,686 --> 00:05:07,677
''I win! I win! ''

74
00:05:09,044 --> 00:05:12,275
I went out with him for
two months. I didn't get to win once!

75
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:16,112
How do we end up with these jerks?
We're good people.

76
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:19,077
I don't know. I think we're like
some kind of magnets.

77
00:05:19,316 --> 00:05:22,672
I know I am. That's why I can't
wear a digital watch.

78
00:05:25,551 --> 00:05:27,348
There's more beer, right?

79
00:05:29,348 --> 00:05:32,385
Oh! You know my friend Abby
who shaves her head?

80
00:05:33,904 --> 00:05:36,498
She says to break the
bad-boyfriend cycle. . .

81
00:05:36,742 --> 00:05:38,937
. . .you can do a cleansing ritual.

82
00:05:41,538 --> 00:05:45,008
Pheebs, this woman
is voluntarily bald.

83
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,847
So we can do it
tomorrow night, you guys.

84
00:05:51,091 --> 00:05:52,843
It's Valentine's Day.
It's perfect.

85
00:05:53,329 --> 00:05:55,365
Okay, well, what kind of ritual?

86
00:05:55,608 --> 00:05:59,487
Okay, we can burn the stuff
they gave us.

87
00:06:00,524 --> 00:06:01,923
Or. . .?

88
00:06:02,163 --> 00:06:06,759
Or we can chant and dance
around naked, you know, with sticks.

89
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:10,906
Burning's good.

90
00:06:11,156 --> 00:06:12,635
I've got stuff to burn.

91
00:06:20,828 --> 00:06:21,704
You know. . .

92
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:26,739
. . .ever since I was little, I've been
able to pick up quarters with my toes.

93
00:06:26,983 --> 00:06:27,893
Yeah?

94
00:06:28,302 --> 00:06:29,496
Good for you.

95
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:35,292
Quarters or rolls of quarters?

96
00:06:40,573 --> 00:06:44,202
By the way, Chandler,
I cut you out of all of my pictures.

97
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:47,760
So if you want, I have a bag
with just your heads.

98
00:06:49,446 --> 00:06:50,674
That's okay.

99
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:54,915
Are you sure? Because you
could make little puppets out of them.

100
00:06:55,162 --> 00:06:58,518
And you could use them in your
Theater of Cruelty!

101
00:07:01,197 --> 00:07:02,596
We can't do that!

102
00:07:03,675 --> 00:07:05,711
What? What can't you do?

103
00:07:08,831 --> 00:07:10,947
Can I talk to you for a second?
Over there?

104
00:07:18,264 --> 00:07:19,822
We might be leaving now.

105
00:07:20,942 --> 00:07:22,500
Say it's you and me ''we. ''

106
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:27,773
She said she wants to slather my body
with stuff and then lick it off.

107
00:07:28,016 --> 00:07:30,576
I'm not even sure what slathering is!

108
00:07:31,134 --> 00:07:33,568
But I definitely want to be
a part of it!

109
00:07:34,971 --> 00:07:37,485
Okay, you cannot do this to me.

110
00:07:38,848 --> 00:07:41,043
You're right. I'm sorry.
You're right.

111
00:07:41,246 --> 00:07:45,364
Can we have three chocolate mousses
to go, please?

112
00:07:46,122 --> 00:07:47,441
I'm out of here.

113
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,357
Here's my credit card.
Dinner's on me. I'm sorry.

114
00:07:52,917 --> 00:07:55,067
I hope she throws up on you.

115
00:07:57,434 --> 00:07:58,423
Thanks.

116
00:08:00,631 --> 00:08:01,461
So. . . .

117
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,309
Just us.

118
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:05,859
What a crappy night!

119
00:08:06,187 --> 00:08:10,146
Though I've enjoyed the fact that
your shirt's been sticking out. . .

120
00:08:10,384 --> 00:08:13,103
. . .of your zipper since you
came back from the bathroom.

121
00:08:18,138 --> 00:08:19,127
Excuse me.

122
00:08:22,494 --> 00:08:23,722
How you doing?

123
00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:32,205
So do we have the best friends,
or what?

124
00:08:32,447 --> 00:08:34,677
Joey's not a friend. He's. . .

125
00:08:36,563 --> 00:08:39,714
. . .a stupid man who left us
his credit card.

126
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,636
Another drink? Some dessert?
A big-screen TV?

127
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:46,390
I will go for that drink.

128
00:08:46,636 --> 00:08:48,115
You got it. Good woman!

129
00:08:53,351 --> 00:08:55,706
A bottle of your
most overpriced champagne.

130
00:08:55,909 --> 00:08:56,580
Each.

131
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:58,102
That's right. Each.

132
00:08:58,307 --> 00:08:59,581
And a rob roy.

133
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,303
I've always wanted to know.

134
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:23,365
Happy Valentine's Day!

135
00:09:31,121 --> 00:09:33,840
Oh, I miss you already.

136
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,796
Can you believe this happened?

137
00:09:37,037 --> 00:09:38,436
No, no!

138
00:09:39,755 --> 00:09:41,234
And yet it did.

139
00:09:42,113 --> 00:09:44,263
-Goodbye, Janice.
-Kiss me!

140
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:48,303
Oh, Chandler. Sorry.

141
00:09:49,347 --> 00:09:51,702
Oh, Chandler. Sorry!

142
00:09:53,744 --> 00:09:54,699
Hey, Janice.

143
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,853
Hi, Monica.

144
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:58,860
Okay. Well, this was very special.

145
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:02,817
Rach, come see who's out here!

146
00:10:03,297 --> 00:10:06,050
What's going on--?
Oh, my God!

147
00:10:06,254 --> 00:10:08,324
Janice! Hi!

148
00:10:08,812 --> 00:10:11,372
Janice is gonna go away now!

149
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:14,244
I'll be right back.

150
00:10:16,247 --> 00:10:18,283
Joey! Look who it is!

151
00:10:22,282 --> 00:10:23,761
Oh, good! Joey's home now!

152
00:10:24,001 --> 00:10:26,231
This is so much fun!

153
00:10:26,479 --> 00:10:29,357
This is like a reunion in the hall!

154
00:10:31,395 --> 00:10:34,353
Hi, Ross. There's someone
I want you to say hi to.

155
00:10:36,631 --> 00:10:37,905
He just happened to call.

156
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:42,428
Hello, Ross. Yes, that's right!
It's me! How did you know?

157
00:10:48,302 --> 00:10:51,851
I'm just saying if dogs
do experience jet lag, then. . .

158
00:10:52,099 --> 00:10:56,217
. . .because of the whole seven-dog-
years-to-one-human-year thing. . .

159
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:59,607
. . .that when a dog flies
from New York to Los Angeles. . .

160
00:10:59,813 --> 00:11:03,806
. . .he doesn't just lose three hours,
he loses, like, a week and a half!

161
00:11:07,047 --> 00:11:08,162
That's funny!

162
00:11:25,233 --> 00:11:26,302
Who are they?

163
00:11:26,632 --> 00:11:28,702
The blond is my ex-wife.

164
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:31,862
And the woman touching her is her. . .

165
00:11:32,268 --> 00:11:34,179
. . .close personal friend.

166
00:11:36,665 --> 00:11:38,303
You mean they're lovers?

167
00:11:38,543 --> 00:11:40,534
If you want to put a label on it.

168
00:11:43,859 --> 00:11:46,657
-Anything else I should know?
-Nope. That's it.

169
00:11:48,136 --> 00:11:50,366
Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby.

170
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:56,162
I always forget that part.

171
00:11:58,248 --> 00:11:59,237
Hello!

172
00:12:05,522 --> 00:12:10,232
Okay. So now we need sage branches
and the sacramental wine.

173
00:12:12,237 --> 00:12:14,432
All I had is oregano and a Fresca.

174
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:16,390
That's okay!

175
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:24,461
All right. Now we need the semen
of a righteous man.

176
00:12:30,023 --> 00:12:34,255
If we had that, we wouldn't be doing
the ritual in the first place.

177
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:37,730
Can we start throwing things in?

178
00:12:37,977 --> 00:12:39,205
Yeah, okay!

179
00:12:42,734 --> 00:12:44,247
Okay. Barry's letters.

180
00:12:45,611 --> 00:12:48,125
Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.

181
00:12:48,369 --> 00:12:52,248
And I have the receipt
from my dinner with--

182
00:12:56,203 --> 00:12:59,354
-A picture of Scotty Jared, naked!
-Let me see!

183
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,392
He's wearing a sweater.

184
00:13:06,795 --> 00:13:10,424
Okay, and here we have
the last of Paolo's grappa.

185
00:13:10,672 --> 00:13:12,071
Wait! Isn't it almost pure--

186
00:13:17,187 --> 00:13:19,826
How can I dump this woman
on Valentine's Day?

187
00:13:20,904 --> 00:13:22,895
I don't know.
You dumped her on New Year's.

188
00:13:24,981 --> 00:13:28,690
Oh, man! In my next life
I'm coming back as a toilet brush.

189
00:13:30,457 --> 00:13:32,846
Hello, funny valentine!

190
00:13:33,774 --> 00:13:35,492
Hi, just Janice.

191
00:13:36,452 --> 00:13:38,807
Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker.

192
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:42,486
I could just kiss you all over
and I'm gonna!

193
00:13:47,444 --> 00:13:49,162
If you don't do it, I will.

194
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:04,545
So what do you do for a living?

195
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,344
Well, for the past few years,
I've been. . . .

196
00:14:07,548 --> 00:14:10,108
You said they could
shoot the spot without you.

197
00:14:10,306 --> 00:14:11,261
I thought they could!

198
00:14:11,505 --> 00:14:14,656
--working with children,
which is really fulfilling.

199
00:14:14,903 --> 00:14:17,975
I'll try to get back
as soon as I can. I'm sorry.

200
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,371
So I'm spending most
of my time teaching science. . .

201
00:14:21,617 --> 00:14:25,212
. . .which is funny because
that wasn't even my major.

202
00:14:36,926 --> 00:14:38,644
Now, that is funny!

203
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:42,991
Hey, do you think--

204
00:14:43,401 --> 00:14:47,030
Would it be too weird if I invited
Carol over to join us?

205
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:49,269
Because she's alone now.

206
00:14:49,796 --> 00:14:51,514
And pregnant. And sad.

207
00:14:52,713 --> 00:14:54,032
-I guess.
-Are you sure?

208
00:14:54,272 --> 00:14:55,625
Thanks. Carol!

209
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,023
Wanna come over and join us?

210
00:14:58,229 --> 00:14:59,423
Oh, no. I'm fine.

211
00:14:59,668 --> 00:15:02,626
Come on, stand up. These people
will scooch down.

212
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,897
Come over here.
You guys will scooch, won't you?

213
00:15:06,223 --> 00:15:09,021
Let's try scooching! Come on!

214
00:15:09,221 --> 00:15:11,257
-Come on.
-Thank you.

215
00:15:13,297 --> 00:15:16,255
Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willet.

216
00:15:16,495 --> 00:15:17,405
Carol, Kristen.

217
00:15:17,614 --> 00:15:19,206
How do you do?

218
00:15:19,453 --> 00:15:21,250
Carol teaches sixth grade.

219
00:15:21,651 --> 00:15:23,881
And Kristen. . . .

220
00:15:27,087 --> 00:15:29,317
Kristen does something. . .

221
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,442
. . .that, funnily enough. . .

222
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:35,600
. . .wasn't even her major!

223
00:15:39,757 --> 00:15:41,156
What do we got there?

224
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,266
A piece of silk boxer shorts. . .

225
00:15:44,873 --> 00:15:46,431
. . .some greeting cards. . .

226
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,949
. . .what looks like a
half-charred picture of. . . .

227
00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:52,978
Wow! That guy's hairier
than the chief!

228
00:15:56,464 --> 00:15:59,661
You know, it's a really funny story
how this happened.

229
00:15:59,902 --> 00:16:01,574
It's all right. Don't explain.

230
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,772
It's not the first boyfriend bonfire
to get out of control.

231
00:16:07,376 --> 00:16:09,571
-You're our third call tonight.
-Really?

232
00:16:09,814 --> 00:16:12,772
Sure. Valentine's is our
busiest night of the year!

233
00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:17,608
I brought you something.

234
00:16:17,808 --> 00:16:19,241
Is it loaded?

235
00:16:23,204 --> 00:16:25,274
Oh, little candy hearts!

236
00:16:26,641 --> 00:16:29,155
''Chan and Jan forever! ''

237
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:31,595
I had them made special.

238
00:16:35,234 --> 00:16:36,428
Okay, Janice.

239
00:16:37,513 --> 00:16:38,468
Janice.

240
00:16:40,031 --> 00:16:41,100
Hey, Janice.

241
00:16:44,227 --> 00:16:46,343
There's no way for me
to tell you this.

242
00:16:46,586 --> 00:16:49,020
At least, no new way
for me to tell you this.

243
00:16:52,021 --> 00:16:54,694
I just don't think things
are gonna work out.

244
00:16:57,297 --> 00:16:58,446
That's fine.

245
00:17:02,213 --> 00:17:03,726
It is?

246
00:17:03,972 --> 00:17:07,408
Because I know that this
isn't the end.

247
00:17:09,408 --> 00:17:11,763
Oh, no. You see, actually, it is.

248
00:17:12,006 --> 00:17:14,725
No, it isn't. Because you
won't let that happen.

249
00:17:14,964 --> 00:17:16,363
Don't you know it yet?

250
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:19,639
You love me, Chandler Bing!

251
00:17:23,677 --> 00:17:25,190
Oh, no, I don't.

252
00:17:25,915 --> 00:17:28,554
Then why do you think
we keep ending up together?

253
00:17:28,793 --> 00:17:30,545
New Year's, who invited who?

254
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:33,544
Valentine's, who asked who
into whose bed?

255
00:17:33,789 --> 00:17:34,619
I did, but--

256
00:17:34,868 --> 00:17:36,096
You seek me out!

257
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:41,262
Something deep in your soul
calls out to me like a foghorn!

258
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:45,212
Janice! Janice!

259
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,695
You want me! You need me!

260
00:17:47,978 --> 00:17:51,015
You can't live without me!

261
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:52,815
And you know it!

262
00:17:53,174 --> 00:17:56,883
You just don't know you know it.

263
00:18:01,128 --> 00:18:02,163
See you.

264
00:18:08,842 --> 00:18:09,991
Call me!

265
00:18:18,235 --> 00:18:22,069
It's not true. I never called
your mother a wolverine.

266
00:18:22,272 --> 00:18:24,706
You did so. I swear.
I swear to--

267
00:18:28,467 --> 00:18:30,742
How long has she been in the bathroom?

268
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:34,662
I don't think she's in the bathroom.
Her coat is gone.

269
00:18:34,982 --> 00:18:36,893
Well, maybe it's cold in there.

270
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:42,256
Maybe I screwed up the first date
I had in nine years.

271
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,885
-That could be it.
-Oh, God.

272
00:18:46,133 --> 00:18:48,442
You know, this is still pretty hot.

273
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:54,043
Mushroom.

274
00:18:55,446 --> 00:18:56,481
Smile.

275
00:18:57,485 --> 00:19:01,239
They won't all be like this.
Some might even stay through dinner.

276
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,601
-I'm sorry. That's not funny.
-No, it's just. . . .

277
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:08,675
Well, you know the whole
getting-on-with-your-life thing?

278
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,872
Well, do I have to?

279
00:19:11,314 --> 00:19:15,944
I mean, well, I'm sitting here
with this cute woman. . .

280
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:18,146
. . .and she's perfectly nice,
you know?

281
00:19:18,388 --> 00:19:20,185
But there's. . . .

282
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:22,495
That's it.

283
00:19:23,505 --> 00:19:28,215
And then I'm here talking to you,
and it's easy and it's fun.

284
00:19:28,461 --> 00:19:30,816
And I don't have to. . . .

285
00:19:31,219 --> 00:19:32,732
-I know.
-You know?

286
00:19:36,694 --> 00:19:38,605
Here's a wacky thought.

287
00:19:39,892 --> 00:19:42,804
Let's say you and I give it
another shot.

288
00:19:43,729 --> 00:19:45,879
I know what you're gonna say.
You're a lesbian.

289
00:19:48,006 --> 00:19:52,602
But what do you say we just
put that aside for now, you know?

290
00:19:52,842 --> 00:19:55,231
Let's just stick a pin in it, okay?

291
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,233
Because we're great together,
you know?

292
00:19:58,478 --> 00:20:00,434
You can't deny it.

293
00:20:01,435 --> 00:20:03,710
And besides, you're carrying my baby.

294
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:06,592
I mean, how perfect is that?

295
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:09,789
You keep saying that,
but there's something right here.

296
00:20:09,989 --> 00:20:10,785
I love you.

297
00:20:18,742 --> 00:20:20,414
I love you too.

298
00:20:21,979 --> 00:20:23,617
-But--
-No ''but. '' No ''but. ''

299
00:20:25,537 --> 00:20:28,574
You know that thing they
put over here with the pin in it?

300
00:20:31,372 --> 00:20:33,840
It's time to take the pin out.

301
00:20:40,045 --> 00:20:43,799
You'll find someone, I know you will.
The right woman is waiting for you.

302
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:46,761
It's easy for you to say.
You found one already.

303
00:20:49,158 --> 00:20:51,911
All you need is a woman who likes men
and you'll be set.

304
00:20:55,993 --> 00:20:57,142
Not her.

305
00:21:07,904 --> 00:21:10,737
We get off around midnight.
Why don't we pick you up then?

306
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:15,134
So will you bring the truck?

307
00:21:17,537 --> 00:21:19,528
I'll even let you ring the bell.

308
00:21:20,095 --> 00:21:22,928
-We'll see you later.
-Bye! See you later!

309
00:21:23,132 --> 00:21:24,770
Thanks. See you.

310
00:21:25,011 --> 00:21:26,205
Oh, my God!

311
00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:28,927
See, there you go.

312
00:21:29,168 --> 00:21:31,443
-The cleansing worked.
-You're right!

313
00:21:31,686 --> 00:21:33,085
They're nice guys!

314
00:21:33,484 --> 00:21:35,600
They're firemen guys!

315
00:21:37,161 --> 00:21:38,753
-You tell them you're married?
-No way!

316
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,719
My girlfriend doesn't know.
I'm not gonna tell them!
