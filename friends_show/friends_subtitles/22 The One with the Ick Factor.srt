1
00:00:00,092 --> 00:00:01,764
-Tell him!
-Please tell him!

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:02,766
Shut up!

3
00:00:02,968 --> 00:00:04,117
Tell me what?

4
00:00:04,326 --> 00:00:05,679
You won't even look at him.

5
00:00:05,884 --> 00:00:09,638
Come on. I could use another
reason why women won't Look at me.

6
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:11,025
AII right.

7
00:00:11,274 --> 00:00:14,107
Last night, I had a dream. . .

8
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:15,624
. . .that you and I. . .

9
00:00:15,868 --> 00:00:16,664
. . .were. . . .

10
00:00:16,866 --> 00:00:18,663
Doing it on this table.

11
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,374
Excellent dream score.

12
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:28,807
Why would you dream that?

13
00:00:30,246 --> 00:00:31,599
More importantly. . .

14
00:00:31,802 --> 00:00:33,030
. . .was I any good?

15
00:00:34,398 --> 00:00:36,958
Well, you were pretty damn good.

16
00:00:37,234 --> 00:00:40,465
Interesting. In my dreams,
I'm surprisingly inadequate.

17
00:00:42,546 --> 00:00:45,538
Last night, you seemed to know
your way around the table.

18
00:00:49,296 --> 00:00:51,526
I love it when we share.

19
00:00:55,366 --> 00:00:56,162
You okay?

20
00:00:56,404 --> 00:00:59,521
I can't believe you two
had sex in her dream!

21
00:01:00,278 --> 00:01:02,155
I'm sorry.
It was a one-time thing.

22
00:01:02,356 --> 00:01:05,553
I was very drunk, and it was
someone else's subconscious.

23
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:09,178
The One With the Ick Factor

25
00:01:53,636 --> 00:01:54,830
Hello, Rachel.

26
00:01:55,434 --> 00:01:56,833
Get off!

27
00:01:59,388 --> 00:02:02,425
Oh, give me! Can you see me
operating a drill press?

28
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,811
I don't know.
What are you wearing?

29
00:02:09,452 --> 00:02:11,886
Why would you want to
operate a drill press?

30
00:02:12,088 --> 00:02:13,407
For some short-term work.

31
00:02:13,606 --> 00:02:15,836
Till I get back some
of my massage clients.

32
00:02:16,082 --> 00:02:17,595
Pirates again?

33
00:02:18,158 --> 00:02:20,547
No. Nothing like that.

34
00:02:20,754 --> 00:02:22,824
I'm just such a dummy.

35
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,630
I taught a ''Massage Yourself
at Home'' workshop.

36
00:02:25,866 --> 00:02:27,379
And they are.

37
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:30,818
Hey, Chan, she could work for you.

38
00:02:31,658 --> 00:02:34,013
Thanks, Joey. That's a good idea.

39
00:02:34,334 --> 00:02:35,813
I could! I could do it!

40
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,079
What is it?

41
00:02:37,288 --> 00:02:38,960
My secretary's gonna be out.

42
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:41,122
She's having one of her
boobs reduced.

43
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,028
It's a whole big boob story.

44
00:02:45,236 --> 00:02:46,464
I could be a secretary.

45
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:49,548
I don't know if it's
your kind of thing. . .

46
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,139
. . .because it involves
a lot of being normal. . .

47
00:02:53,024 --> 00:02:54,503
. . .for a large portion of the day.

48
00:02:54,902 --> 00:02:56,540
I could do that.

49
00:02:58,016 --> 00:03:00,086
-What're you playing with?
-My new beeper.

50
00:03:00,292 --> 00:03:02,647
Why does a paleontologist
need a beeper?

51
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:04,759
Is it for dinosaur emergencies?

52
00:03:05,006 --> 00:03:06,678
Help! They're still extinct!

53
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,556
It's for when Carol goes into labor.
She can get me wherever I am.

54
00:03:11,796 --> 00:03:15,232
AII she has to do is dial 55-JIMBO.

55
00:03:16,068 --> 00:03:18,502
A cool number and
a possible name for the kid.

56
00:03:19,544 --> 00:03:20,499
See you later.

57
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,095
Off to see young Ethan?

58
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:23,897
Thank you.

59
00:03:24,774 --> 00:03:27,288
How young is young Ethan?
Young?

60
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,320
He's our age.

61
00:03:30,566 --> 00:03:32,079
When we were. . . .

62
00:03:35,678 --> 00:03:37,270
He's a senior in college.

63
00:03:37,516 --> 00:03:38,631
College?

64
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,864
This man-child has no problem
with how old you are?

65
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,295
No, of course not.

66
00:03:44,544 --> 00:03:46,296
It's not even an issue. . .

67
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:48,134
. . .because I told him I was 22.

68
00:03:48,338 --> 00:03:49,566
-You what?
-What?

69
00:03:49,776 --> 00:03:51,209
Oh, I can't pass for 22?

70
00:03:51,414 --> 00:03:53,245
Well, maybe 25, 26.

71
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:54,525
I am 26.

72
00:03:54,928 --> 00:03:55,997
There you go.

73
00:04:08,308 --> 00:04:09,627
Can you hear that?

74
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,691
That'll stop
when you pick up the phone.

75
00:04:18,412 --> 00:04:19,401
Oh, I'm on!

76
00:04:22,286 --> 00:04:24,402
Mr. Bing's office.

77
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,436
I'm sorry he's
in a meeting right now.

78
00:04:28,676 --> 00:04:30,234
I'm not in a meeting.

79
00:04:30,474 --> 00:04:33,034
Will he know what
this is in reference to?

80
00:04:33,268 --> 00:04:34,781
And he has your number?

81
00:04:34,986 --> 00:04:37,580
I'II see that he gets
the message. Bye-bye!

82
00:04:41,016 --> 00:04:41,812
Ross says hi.

83
00:04:43,454 --> 00:04:45,968
This is so fun!
What do we do now?

84
00:04:46,168 --> 00:04:48,921
Well, now I actually
have to get to work.

85
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,756
''Most likely. ''

86
00:04:54,596 --> 00:04:56,666
Okay, I'm gonna be out there.

87
00:04:56,952 --> 00:04:58,749
AII right. Bye-bye.

88
00:04:58,988 --> 00:05:00,341
Bye-bye.

89
00:05:05,778 --> 00:05:06,574
Yes?

90
00:05:06,816 --> 00:05:08,534
What you doing?

91
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,886
Okay, windows are clean.
Candles are lit.

92
00:05:15,084 --> 00:05:17,279
Belt's too tight.
Gotta change the belt.

93
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,358
Did I turn the fish?
Nope, because I made lasagna.

94
00:05:21,994 --> 00:05:23,029
Am I out of control?

95
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,143
Just a touch.

96
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:29,303
Mon, I don't understand.
You've been dating this guy since. . .

97
00:05:29,502 --> 00:05:30,537
. . .his midterms.

98
00:05:31,938 --> 00:05:34,088
Why, all of the sudden,
are you so. . .?

99
00:05:38,288 --> 00:05:39,084
What?

100
00:05:39,966 --> 00:05:42,685
Could tonight be the night?

101
00:05:44,238 --> 00:05:47,116
I don't know. He's a great guy. . .

102
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:50,465
. . .and I Love being with him.
But, you know. . .

103
00:05:50,828 --> 00:05:53,865
. . .things happen when they happen.
You don't plan these things.

104
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,333
So did you shave your legs?

105
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:05,288
Would you let it go, Ross?
It was just a dream.

106
00:06:05,486 --> 00:06:06,885
It doesn't mean--

107
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,070
This is it! It's baby time.
Baby time!

108
00:06:11,316 --> 00:06:13,750
AII right, relax, just relax.
Be cool.

109
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,627
Yeah, hi. I was just beeped.

110
00:06:19,304 --> 00:06:21,260
No, Andre is not here.

111
00:06:21,502 --> 00:06:23,572
Third time today.

112
00:06:24,058 --> 00:06:25,616
Yes, I am sure.

113
00:06:26,694 --> 00:06:28,730
I do not perform
those kind of services.

114
00:06:30,168 --> 00:06:31,601
Services?

115
00:06:31,806 --> 00:06:33,000
Oh, services.

116
00:06:33,642 --> 00:06:36,634
Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO.

117
00:06:40,432 --> 00:06:41,831
That's right.

118
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,988
That's right.
JUMBO with a ''U,'' sir.

119
00:06:45,224 --> 00:06:46,623
No, you don't want me.

120
00:06:46,862 --> 00:06:49,979
Judging by his number,
I'd be a huge disappointment.

121
00:06:51,176 --> 00:06:53,167
Alrighty, bye-bye.

122
00:06:56,766 --> 00:06:58,563
How was the first day?

123
00:06:58,764 --> 00:07:01,995
Excellent!
Everyone was so, so nice!

124
00:07:02,198 --> 00:07:04,632
It pays to know the man
who wears my shoes.

125
00:07:05,832 --> 00:07:06,628
Me.

126
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:11,017
-I didn't tell anyone I knew you.
-Why not?

127
00:07:11,224 --> 00:07:12,942
Well, because, you know.

128
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,333
They don't Like you.

129
00:07:18,932 --> 00:07:19,728
What?

130
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:20,959
I thought you knew.

131
00:07:23,804 --> 00:07:24,759
Who doesn't Like me?

132
00:07:25,202 --> 00:07:26,715
Everyone.

133
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,558
Except for. . . .

134
00:07:28,796 --> 00:07:30,309
No. Everyone.

135
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,343
What are you talking about?

136
00:07:34,548 --> 00:07:35,901
Don't feel bad.

137
00:07:36,106 --> 00:07:38,256
You know, they used to
Like you a Lot.

138
00:07:38,462 --> 00:07:40,737
But you got promoted,
and now you're. . .

139
00:07:40,938 --> 00:07:43,088
. . .Mr. Boss Man.
You know, Mr. Big.

140
00:07:43,294 --> 00:07:44,613
Mr. Bing. Boss Man Bing.

141
00:07:47,368 --> 00:07:48,437
I can't believe it.

142
00:07:48,766 --> 00:07:50,597
Yeah. They even do you.

143
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,956
They ''do'' me?

144
00:07:54,278 --> 00:07:55,791
You know, Like, okay.

145
00:07:56,634 --> 00:07:58,864
''Could that report be any Later?''

146
00:08:04,342 --> 00:08:05,377
I don't sound Like that.

147
00:08:06,218 --> 00:08:07,014
Yeah, you do.

148
00:08:08,734 --> 00:08:11,453
''The hills are alive
with the sound. . .

149
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,648
. . .of music. ''

150
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,756
''My scone!

151
00:08:20,078 --> 00:08:21,830
My scone! ''

152
00:08:23,872 --> 00:08:26,102
I don't sound Like that.
That is so not true.

153
00:08:29,184 --> 00:08:31,061
That is so not--
That is so not--

154
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,291
That--
Oh, shut up!

155
00:08:36,852 --> 00:08:39,412
-Did not!
-I'm telling you, up until I was 9. . .

156
00:08:39,648 --> 00:08:42,287
. . .I thought gunpoint was
a place where crimes happened.

157
00:08:43,002 --> 00:08:43,832
How's that possible?

158
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,832
It's always on the news.

159
00:08:46,078 --> 00:08:48,797
''A man is being held up at Gunpoint. ''

160
00:08:48,992 --> 00:08:51,187
''Tourists are terrorized
at Gunpoint. ''

161
00:08:51,668 --> 00:08:54,705
And I kept thinking,
why do people continue to go there?

162
00:09:00,136 --> 00:09:01,091
I should go.

163
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,709
-Unless--
-What?

164
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:15,790
Unless you wanna stay over.

165
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,702
I mean, I'm going to. So. . . .

166
00:09:20,304 --> 00:09:22,340
Yeah, I'd really Like that.

167
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:33,369
Before we get into any
staying-over stuff. . .

168
00:09:33,604 --> 00:09:35,515
. . .there's something you should know.

169
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,157
Is this, Like,
''I have an early class tomorrow'' . . .

170
00:09:39,394 --> 00:09:41,908
. . .or ''I'm secretly married
to a goat''?

171
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:45,860
Well, it's somewhere in between.

172
00:09:46,064 --> 00:09:50,103
You see, in a strictly technical
sense, of course, I'm not. . . .

173
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:53,051
Well, I mean, I haven't ever. . . .

174
00:09:53,254 --> 00:09:54,482
Ethan?

175
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:56,359
Are you a virgin?

176
00:09:56,768 --> 00:10:00,727
Well, if that's what you kids are
calling it these days, then. . .

177
00:10:00,962 --> 00:10:01,872
. . .yes, I am.

178
00:10:04,756 --> 00:10:08,032
I am. I've kind of been
waiting for the right person.

179
00:10:09,828 --> 00:10:11,056
Really?

180
00:10:13,342 --> 00:10:15,572
You do know I was talking
about you, right?

181
00:10:24,126 --> 00:10:25,445
Wow!

182
00:10:26,522 --> 00:10:28,001
You keep saying that.

183
00:10:28,598 --> 00:10:31,874
You know, you read about it.
You see it in the movies.

184
00:10:32,112 --> 00:10:35,627
Even when you practice it at home,
man, oh, man. . .

185
00:10:35,986 --> 00:10:38,420
. . .it is nothing Like that.

186
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,696
Listen, listen.

187
00:10:44,694 --> 00:10:48,767
You told me something
that was really difficult for you.

188
00:10:48,966 --> 00:10:52,925
And I figure if you can
be honest, then I can too.

189
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,198
Don't tell me I did it wrong.

190
00:10:58,432 --> 00:11:00,388
Nothing wrong about that.

191
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:05,183
Here goes.

192
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,411
I'm not 22.

193
00:11:08,976 --> 00:11:11,171
I'm 25. . .

194
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:13,729
. . .and 1 3 months.

195
00:11:16,644 --> 00:11:18,953
But I figure that shouldn’t
change anything.

196
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,390
What does it matter how old we are?

197
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,144
Listen. . .

198
00:11:26,828 --> 00:11:28,864
. . .as long as we're
telling stuff. . .

199
00:11:30,822 --> 00:11:32,938
. . .I have another one for you.

200
00:11:33,618 --> 00:11:35,848
I'm a little younger than I said.

201
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,158
You're not a senior?

202
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:41,319
Oh, I'm a senior. . .

203
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,235
. . .in high school.

204
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,937
What we did was wrong.

205
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:04,288
I just had sex with someone who
wasn't alive during the bicentennial!

206
00:12:07,564 --> 00:12:09,475
I just had sex.

207
00:12:11,758 --> 00:12:14,909
Ethan, focus.
How could you not tell me?

208
00:12:15,114 --> 00:12:16,433
You never told me your age.

209
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,665
That's different!

210
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:21,067
My lie didn't make one of us
a felon in 48 states!

211
00:12:22,502 --> 00:12:25,460
-What were you thinking?
-I was too busy falling--

212
00:12:25,696 --> 00:12:26,526
Don't say it!

213
00:12:26,736 --> 00:12:27,691
In Love with you.

214
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:30,441
Really?

215
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:31,639
Sorry.

216
00:12:33,444 --> 00:12:34,672
Well, fall out of it.

217
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:37,197
You shouldn’t be here.
It's a school night!

218
00:12:40,114 --> 00:12:41,866
Oh, God!

219
00:12:42,112 --> 00:12:44,262
I'm Like those women
that you see. . .

220
00:12:44,508 --> 00:12:46,817
. . .with shiny guys named Chad.

221
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,612
I'm Joan Collins.

222
00:12:54,812 --> 00:12:55,608
Who?

223
00:13:03,998 --> 00:13:07,195
Andre should be there
in about 45 minutes.

224
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,386
Alrighty. Bye-bye.

225
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:14,415
It's just easier that way.

226
00:13:16,218 --> 00:13:18,413
You told me about the last dream.

227
00:13:18,654 --> 00:13:20,212
No. Forget it.

228
00:13:20,412 --> 00:13:24,166
Why not? Was I doing
something particularly saucy?

229
00:13:26,244 --> 00:13:27,757
AII right. Fine.

230
00:13:29,438 --> 00:13:31,349
You were not the only one there.

231
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:33,822
Joey was too.

232
00:13:36,428 --> 00:13:37,224
AII right.

233
00:13:39,024 --> 00:13:40,503
Was there. . .

234
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:46,251
. . .anybody else there?

235
00:13:46,612 --> 00:13:47,408
No.

236
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,761
You sure? Nobody. . .

237
00:13:49,966 --> 00:13:52,526
. . .handing out mints or anything?

238
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,958
No, just the three of us.

239
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:00,544
So was it you and Chandler. . .

240
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:03,065
. . .then you and me
or you, me and Chandler?

241
00:14:05,382 --> 00:14:07,418
-You know what?
-What?

242
00:14:08,178 --> 00:14:09,930
There were times. . .

243
00:14:10,176 --> 00:14:12,087
. . .when it wasn't even me.

244
00:14:21,558 --> 00:14:24,868
That is so sweet, you guys!

245
00:14:30,344 --> 00:14:31,743
Mon, Ethan called again.

246
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:39,886
What?

247
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:41,316
Ethan called again.

248
00:14:42,724 --> 00:14:44,077
You're not seeing him anymore?

249
00:14:44,282 --> 00:14:45,635
No.

250
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,075
Sometimes, just things don't work out.

251
00:14:48,396 --> 00:14:52,355
This has nothing to do with him
needing a note to get out of gym?

252
00:14:56,304 --> 00:14:59,216
I didn't say any--
I did not say anything. I swear.

253
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:00,607
He stopped by.

254
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,169
Next time you talk to him. . .

255
00:15:02,374 --> 00:15:05,810
. . .could you ask him which one
the strongest Power Ranger is?

256
00:15:08,284 --> 00:15:11,879
Oh, my life is just so amusing.
Can we drop it now?

257
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,274
Sorry.

258
00:15:13,876 --> 00:15:15,275
''It's morphin time! ''

259
00:15:15,474 --> 00:15:16,987
-Stegosaurus!
-Tyrannosaurus!

260
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:23,783
I gotta go.

261
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,379
Head rush.

262
00:15:27,456 --> 00:15:30,016
One more, and then I have to go.

263
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,239
Cool.

264
00:15:34,924 --> 00:15:35,720
Where you going?

265
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,076
A birthday party
with some work people.

266
00:15:39,276 --> 00:15:40,755
Work people?

267
00:15:41,834 --> 00:15:42,744
Nobody told me.

268
00:15:42,992 --> 00:15:45,187
No, I know.
That's part of the whole. . .

269
00:15:45,428 --> 00:15:47,703
. . .them-not-liking-you
extravaganza.

270
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,732
I don't get it. A month ago,
these people were my friends.

271
00:15:52,936 --> 00:15:55,848
Just because I'm in charge,
I'm not a different person.

272
00:15:56,170 --> 00:16:00,800
Then come, hang out. Let them see
what a great guy you still are.

273
00:16:01,004 --> 00:16:03,040
-You think I should?
-I really do.

274
00:16:05,078 --> 00:16:06,670
But could we not go together?

275
00:16:08,272 --> 00:16:10,911
I don't wanna be the geek
who invited the boss.

276
00:16:14,782 --> 00:16:16,101
Last night was great.

277
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:19,889
You know, the karaoke thing?
Tracy and I doing ''Ebony and Ivory. ''

278
00:16:20,174 --> 00:16:22,768
You were great!
But they still made fun of you.

279
00:16:23,408 --> 00:16:24,204
What?

280
00:16:24,408 --> 00:16:26,126
Now you're Mr. Caring Boss.

281
00:16:26,364 --> 00:16:27,843
Mr. I'm-one-of-you Boss.

282
00:16:28,042 --> 00:16:30,636
Mr. I-wanna-be-your-buddy.
Boss Man Bing!

283
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:33,474
Then I don't get it.

284
00:16:34,352 --> 00:16:37,947
Well, you know what, Chandler?
I think you just gotta face it.

285
00:16:38,146 --> 00:16:40,501
You're, Like, the guy
in the big office.

286
00:16:40,702 --> 00:16:43,455
You're the one that hires them
and fires them.

287
00:16:43,698 --> 00:16:45,131
They say you're a great boss.

288
00:16:45,454 --> 00:16:46,250
They do?

289
00:16:46,492 --> 00:16:48,881
But they're not
your friends anymore.

290
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:51,805
-I just want--
-But you can't.

291
00:16:52,844 --> 00:16:53,959
But I just want--

292
00:17:04,504 --> 00:17:05,300
Are you gonna--

293
00:17:05,504 --> 00:17:09,019
Carol and I have a new system.
If she punches in 9-1 -1 . . .

294
00:17:09,218 --> 00:17:12,608
. . .it means she's having a baby.
Otherwise, I just ignore it.

295
00:17:12,852 --> 00:17:13,967
What about Andre?

296
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:17,162
He got a call from what I think
was our cousin, Nathan.

297
00:17:17,366 --> 00:17:20,005
Frankly, it was a Little more
than I needed to know.

298
00:17:28,388 --> 00:17:29,707
That was gonna be my opener.

299
00:17:31,144 --> 00:17:34,819
Did you guys check out those
new hand dryers in the bathroom?

300
00:17:35,018 --> 00:17:37,168
-I thought that was just a rumor.
-True story.

301
00:17:41,648 --> 00:17:43,798
Look, I gotta tell you something.

302
00:17:44,044 --> 00:17:47,673
I'm not 1 7. I said that so you'd
think I was cute and vulnerable.

303
00:17:47,878 --> 00:17:48,993
I'm actually 30.

304
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:52,148
I have a wife. I have a job.
I'm your congressman.

305
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,990
This is ridiculous.
We are great together!

306
00:17:56,224 --> 00:17:59,978
We can talk. We make each other
laugh. And the sex. Oh, man!

307
00:18:00,178 --> 00:18:02,897
I have no frame of reference,
but I thought that was great!

308
00:18:04,092 --> 00:18:05,844
-It was.
-What's the problem?

309
00:18:08,406 --> 00:18:10,317
Ethan, it's. . . .

310
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,236
It's icky.

311
00:18:14,276 --> 00:18:15,072
''Icky''?

312
00:18:15,914 --> 00:18:19,384
You're actually gonna throw this away
because it's icky?

313
00:18:20,706 --> 00:18:22,662
This isn't easy for me either.

314
00:18:22,864 --> 00:18:24,343
I wish things were different.

315
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:27,048
If you were older
or I was younger. . .

316
00:18:27,256 --> 00:18:29,770
. . .or we lived in biblical times. . .

317
00:18:30,732 --> 00:18:31,528
. . .I could really--

318
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,243
No, don't say it.

319
00:18:33,448 --> 00:18:34,483
Love you.

320
00:18:39,078 --> 00:18:41,069
-Are your hands still wet?
-They're moist.

321
00:18:41,276 --> 00:18:42,868
Let's dry them again.

322
00:18:48,744 --> 00:18:52,054
Or, Like, ''Could these margaritas
be any stronger?''

323
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:55,291
Hey, Chandler.

324
00:18:55,532 --> 00:18:56,851
Hello, Mr. Bing.

325
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:59,405
Loved your Stevie Wonder Last night.

326
00:19:01,084 --> 00:19:03,279
Thanks. About the weekly numbers. . .

327
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,988
. . .I'm gonna need them
on my desk by 9:00.

328
00:19:06,196 --> 00:19:07,993
-Sure.
-No problem.

329
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,860
You have to give them something.

330
00:19:13,066 --> 00:19:16,217
That was Gerston, Santos,
and who's the guy with the mustache?

331
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,251
-Petrie.
-Petrie. Right, okay.

332
00:19:18,498 --> 00:19:21,058
Well, some people are
gonna be working. . .

333
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:22,249
. . .this weekend.

334
00:19:51,406 --> 00:19:52,919
Oh, that's nice.

335
00:19:58,436 --> 00:19:59,266
Ross!

336
00:20:09,698 --> 00:20:10,926
I'm here.

337
00:20:13,092 --> 00:20:14,081
You are?

338
00:20:19,562 --> 00:20:21,280
We were just. . . .

339
00:20:23,078 --> 00:20:23,874
What?

340
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:28,788
Great. Now I'm having a baby.

341
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:30,224
What?

342
00:20:31,584 --> 00:20:34,701
I'm having a baby! I'm having a--

343
00:20:34,898 --> 00:20:37,492
-The phone, the phone!
-I don't have the phone.

344
00:20:41,728 --> 00:20:42,877
I'm hurt.

345
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,479
Monica, let's go!
Come on, people! Woman in Labor!

346
00:20:50,954 --> 00:20:53,184
-Look what I got going.
-Save it for the cab.

347
00:20:54,948 --> 00:20:57,178
What are you doing?
We're going to a hospital!

348
00:20:57,384 --> 00:20:59,693
I can't Look nice?
There are doctors there.

349
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,652
-Joey, get out of the fridge!
-AII right, all right!

350
00:21:04,414 --> 00:21:06,291
-What is that?
-For the ride.

351
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:08,162
-Like in a cab--
-Save it!

352
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:09,164
