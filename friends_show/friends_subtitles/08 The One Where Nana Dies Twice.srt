1
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,010
Hey, gorgeous! How's it going?

2
00:00:08,257 --> 00:00:11,135
Dehydrated Japanese noodles
under fluorescent lights.

3
00:00:11,374 --> 00:00:13,524
Does it get better than this?

4
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,519
Question: You're not dating, are you?

5
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:19,235
I met somebody who would be
perfect for you.

6
00:00:19,684 --> 00:00:21,720
You see, perfect might be a problem.

7
00:00:21,961 --> 00:00:25,351
Had you said co-dependent
or self-destructive. . . .

8
00:00:26,077 --> 00:00:28,193
-You want a date Saturday?
-Yes, please.

9
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:31,187
He is cute.

10
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,500
-He's funny. He's--
-He's a he?

11
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:35,061
Well, yeah.

12
00:00:35,346 --> 00:00:36,222
Oh, God!

13
00:00:36,504 --> 00:00:37,778
I just--

14
00:00:38,862 --> 00:00:40,090
You're nice-- Oh, God.

15
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,969
Good, Shelly. I'm gonna go
flush myself down the toilet now.

16
00:00:44,216 --> 00:00:45,285
Okay. Bye-bye.

17
00:00:47,492 --> 00:00:49,528
The One Where Nana Dies Twice

18
00:00:50,848 --> 00:00:51,837
English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

19
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,669
It's hard to enjoy Ramen noodles
after that. Is that ridiculous?

20
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:38,384
Can you believe she actually
thought that?

21
00:01:43,547 --> 00:01:46,015
When I first met you,
I thought maybe. . .

22
00:01:46,264 --> 00:01:47,299
. . .possibly. . .

23
00:01:47,542 --> 00:01:48,531
. . .you might be.

24
00:01:49,779 --> 00:01:50,575
You did?

25
00:01:50,818 --> 00:01:54,015
Then you spent Phoebe's birthday
party talking to my breasts. . .

26
00:01:54,254 --> 00:01:55,972
. . .so then I figured maybe not.

27
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:02,365
Did any of the rest of you guys
think that when you first met me?

28
00:02:02,565 --> 00:02:03,634
-I did.
-I think so.

29
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,196
-Not me.
-No, no, me neither.

30
00:02:09,037 --> 00:02:12,188
Although back in college,
Susan Saladore did.

31
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:13,832
You're kidding.

32
00:02:14,271 --> 00:02:16,307
-Did you tell her I wasn't?
-No.

33
00:02:17,507 --> 00:02:19,975
It's because I wanted
to go out with her too.

34
00:02:20,184 --> 00:02:23,460
So I told her, actually,
you were seeing Bernie Spellman. . .

35
00:02:25,898 --> 00:02:27,126
. . .who also liked her.

36
00:02:31,931 --> 00:02:33,728
Well, this is fascinating.

37
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,126
So what is it about me?

38
00:02:36,805 --> 00:02:39,922
I don't know. Because you're smart,
you're funny. . . .

39
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:42,391
So is Ross.
You ever think that about him?

40
00:02:42,798 --> 00:02:43,628
Yeah, right!

41
00:02:44,156 --> 00:02:45,191
What is it?

42
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:50,225
I don't know. You just--
You have a quality.

43
00:02:50,469 --> 00:02:51,299
Yes, exactly.

44
00:02:51,548 --> 00:02:52,901
Yeah, a quality.

45
00:02:53,585 --> 00:02:57,498
''A quality. '' Good. I was worried
you were gonna be vague about this.

46
00:03:04,733 --> 00:03:06,325
It's Paolo calling from Rome.

47
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:09,368
Oh, my God! Calling from Rome!

48
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:17,119
So he's calling from Rome.
I could do that.

49
00:03:17,638 --> 00:03:19,196
Just gotta go to Rome.

50
00:03:21,913 --> 00:03:24,507
Your Dad just beeped in.
Can you make it quick?

51
00:03:24,749 --> 00:03:26,262
I'm talking to Rome.

52
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:28,620
I'm talking to Rome.

53
00:03:29,704 --> 00:03:31,217
Hey, Dad. What's up?

54
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,255
Oh, God.

55
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:37,215
Ross, it's Nana.

56
00:03:48,482 --> 00:03:50,120
-How you doing?
-Hey, Dad.

57
00:03:53,876 --> 00:03:54,786
How's she doing?

58
00:03:55,514 --> 00:03:57,823
The doctor says
it's a matter of hours.

59
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:01,063
-How are you, Mom?
-Me? I'm fine, fine.

60
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:03,059
I'm glad you're here.

61
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:06,022
What's with your hair?

62
00:04:06,261 --> 00:04:07,330
What?

63
00:04:08,059 --> 00:04:08,855
What's different?

64
00:04:09,298 --> 00:04:10,174
Nothing.

65
00:04:10,696 --> 00:04:12,652
Oh, maybe that's it.

66
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:14,932
She's unbelievable.
Her mother's--

67
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:16,359
Okay, relax.

68
00:04:16,569 --> 00:04:19,003
We are gonna be here a while,
it looks like.

69
00:04:19,206 --> 00:04:21,925
We still have boyfriends
and your career to cover.

70
00:04:22,243 --> 00:04:23,437
Oh, God!

71
00:04:29,914 --> 00:04:33,190
The fuzzy little mints
at the bottom of her purse.

72
00:04:34,029 --> 00:04:36,065
Yeah, they were gross.

73
00:04:36,866 --> 00:04:38,584
You know what I love?

74
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,535
Her Sweet 'N Lows.

75
00:04:40,741 --> 00:04:43,813
How she was always stealing them
from restaurants.

76
00:04:44,057 --> 00:04:46,969
Not just from restaurants,
from our house.

77
00:04:47,693 --> 00:04:48,489
Mrs. Geller?

78
00:04:54,245 --> 00:04:55,519
She looks so small.

79
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:56,952
I know.

80
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:01,351
Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop
and Aunt Phyllis now.

81
00:05:04,993 --> 00:05:06,472
Goodbye, Nana.

82
00:05:13,503 --> 00:05:14,299
Bye, Nana.

83
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:21,730
Nurse!

84
00:05:23,172 --> 00:05:24,446
What is going on?

85
00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:27,928
You know how the nurse said
Nana had passed?

86
00:05:28,126 --> 00:05:29,605
Well, she's not quite.

87
00:05:31,163 --> 00:05:31,959
What?

88
00:05:32,161 --> 00:05:35,790
She's not passed!
She's present! She's back!

89
00:05:36,157 --> 00:05:37,226
What's going on?

90
00:05:37,475 --> 00:05:39,067
She may have died.

91
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:41,101
''She may have died''?

92
00:05:41,351 --> 00:05:42,579
We're looking into it.

93
00:05:44,467 --> 00:05:45,946
I'll go see.

94
00:05:48,902 --> 00:05:50,540
This almost never happens.

95
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:09,317
Now she's passed.

96
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,744
I just have to know, okay?

97
00:06:21,304 --> 00:06:22,498
Is it my hair?

98
00:06:23,062 --> 00:06:25,974
Yes, that's exactly what it is.
It's your hair.

99
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,289
Yeah, you have homosexual hair.

100
00:06:34,929 --> 00:06:36,157
So did she. . .?

101
00:06:36,727 --> 00:06:37,955
Twice.

102
00:06:40,043 --> 00:06:41,635
Oh, that sucks.

103
00:06:43,838 --> 00:06:44,873
You guys okay?

104
00:06:45,317 --> 00:06:46,875
I don't know. It's weird.

105
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:50,471
I know she's gone,
but I just don't feel. . . .

106
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,587
Maybe she's not really gone.

107
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:54,221
No, no, she's gone.

108
00:06:55,105 --> 00:06:56,333
We checked.

109
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:57,772
A lot.

110
00:06:59,101 --> 00:07:01,854
No, I mean, maybe no one
ever really goes.

111
00:07:02,097 --> 00:07:04,850
Ever since my mom died,
every now and then. . .

112
00:07:05,094 --> 00:07:08,689
. . .I get this feeling that she's,
like, right here, you know?

113
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,999
And Debbie, my best friend
from junior high. . .

114
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:18,194
. . .got struck by lightning
on a miniature golf course.

115
00:07:19,477 --> 00:07:21,832
I always get this strong
Debbie vibe. . .

116
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:24,383
. . .whenever I use
a little yellow pencil.

117
00:07:29,346 --> 00:07:30,096
I miss her.

118
00:07:31,263 --> 00:07:32,412
Here, Pheebs.

119
00:07:32,662 --> 00:07:33,617
Want this?

120
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,816
-Oh, thanks.
-Sure.

121
00:07:36,058 --> 00:07:38,174
I just sharpened her this morning.

122
00:07:40,373 --> 00:07:43,365
I don't believe any of that.
I think when you're dead. . .

123
00:07:43,609 --> 00:07:45,998
. . .you're dead. You're gone.
You're worm food.

124
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:51,759
So Chandler looks gay, huh?

125
00:07:55,835 --> 00:07:58,554
I don't know who this is,
but it's not Debbie.

126
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:07,734
I thought it'd be a closed casket.

127
00:08:07,941 --> 00:08:10,774
Well, that doesn't mean
she can't look nice.

128
00:08:15,492 --> 00:08:17,960
Sweetie, you think
you can get in there?

129
00:08:18,369 --> 00:08:20,007
I don't see why not.

130
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:39,500
Here's my retainer!

131
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:50,246
I was just thinking. . .

132
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,368
-. . .when my time comes--
-Dad!

133
00:08:52,609 --> 00:08:53,758
Listen to me!

134
00:08:55,366 --> 00:08:58,995
When my time comes,
I wanna be buried at sea.

135
00:09:01,678 --> 00:09:02,474
You what?

136
00:09:03,357 --> 00:09:06,429
I wanna be buried at sea.
It looks like fun.

137
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,858
Define ''fun. ''

138
00:09:10,069 --> 00:09:14,028
Come on. You'll make a day of it.
You'll get a boat, pack a lunch. . . .

139
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:18,456
And then we throw your body in
the water. Gee, that does sound fun.

140
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:20,092
Everyone thinks they know me.

141
00:09:20,337 --> 00:09:23,295
Everyone says, ''Jack Geller,
so predictable. ''

142
00:09:23,533 --> 00:09:28,084
Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say,
''Buried at sea? Huh. ''

143
00:09:31,324 --> 00:09:33,315
That's probably what they'll say.

144
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:35,354
I'd like that.

145
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:47,582
Hey, gorgeous.

146
00:09:49,223 --> 00:09:51,862
Look, I'm sorry about yesterday.

147
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:56,218
Don't worry about it. Apparently,
other people have made the same mistake.

148
00:09:57,414 --> 00:09:59,052
Okay. Phew!

149
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:04,329
So what do you think it is about me?

150
00:10:05,444 --> 00:10:06,593
I don't know what.

151
00:10:06,803 --> 00:10:08,600
You just have. . .

152
00:10:08,801 --> 00:10:10,598
-. . .a quality.
-A quality. Great.

153
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:14,627
It's a shame, because you and Lowell
would've made a great couple.

154
00:10:16,392 --> 00:10:20,351
Lowell? Financial Services Lowell?
That's who you saw me with?

155
00:10:20,627 --> 00:10:21,662
What? He's cute.

156
00:10:21,905 --> 00:10:23,179
Well, yeah.

157
00:10:23,543 --> 00:10:25,499
He's no Brian in Payroll.

158
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:29,367
Is Brian. . .?

159
00:10:29,616 --> 00:10:32,972
I don't know. The point is,
if you were gonna set me up. . .

160
00:10:33,172 --> 00:10:35,925
. . .I'd like to think it'd be
with somebody like him.

161
00:10:36,129 --> 00:10:38,518
I think Brian's
a little out of your league.

162
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,194
Excuse me. You don't think
I could get a Brian?

163
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:53,184
Because I could get a Brian.
Believe you me.

164
00:10:54,827 --> 00:10:56,226
I'm really not.

165
00:10:57,424 --> 00:10:58,573
This one?

166
00:11:03,138 --> 00:11:05,254
I've shown you every dress we have.

167
00:11:05,495 --> 00:11:09,249
Unless you want her to spend eternity
in a lemon-yellow pantsuit. . .

168
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,526
. . .go with the burgundy.

169
00:11:12,127 --> 00:11:15,324
Whatever we pick, she would've
told us it's the wrong one.

170
00:11:15,563 --> 00:11:17,633
You're right.
We'll go with the burgundy.

171
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,519
A fine choice. I'm coming out.

172
00:11:20,717 --> 00:11:22,355
Wait! We need shoes.

173
00:11:30,586 --> 00:11:31,496
How about these?

174
00:11:32,184 --> 00:11:33,776
That's really a day shoe.

175
00:11:34,022 --> 00:11:36,980
And where she's going,
everyone else will be dressier?

176
00:11:38,377 --> 00:11:40,766
Could we see something
in a slimmer heel?

177
00:11:45,169 --> 00:11:49,287
I have nothing in an evening shoe
in the burgundy.

178
00:11:50,283 --> 00:11:52,877
I can show you something
in a silver that may work.

179
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:55,955
No, it really should be burgundy.

180
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:58,386
Unless we go with a different dress.

181
00:11:58,633 --> 00:12:00,510
No, no, no. Watch this.

182
00:12:00,751 --> 00:12:03,823
Wait, I may have something in the back.

183
00:12:16,053 --> 00:12:17,247
Oh, my God.

184
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:19,329
Is everything all right?

185
00:12:22,126 --> 00:12:24,117
Just Nana's stuff.

186
00:12:41,983 --> 00:12:43,462
How we doing?
You guys ready?

187
00:12:43,701 --> 00:12:46,340
Mom called to remind me
not to wear my hair up.

188
00:12:46,578 --> 00:12:48,808
Did you know my ears were not
my best feature?

189
00:12:49,055 --> 00:12:51,205
Some days it's all I can think about.

190
00:12:52,051 --> 00:12:54,929
Hi! I'm sorry I'm late.
I couldn't find my bearings.

191
00:12:55,487 --> 00:12:56,920
You mean your earrings?

192
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,634
What did I say?

193
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:03,953
-Are these the shoes?
-Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.

194
00:13:04,277 --> 00:13:07,110
What? We don't have shoes here?

195
00:13:09,231 --> 00:13:10,949
Morning. We ready to go?

196
00:13:11,189 --> 00:13:13,066
Don't we look nice all dressed up?

197
00:13:14,785 --> 00:13:16,901
It's stuff like that, isn't it?

198
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:31,321
-It was a really beautiful service.
-It really was.

199
00:13:33,363 --> 00:13:34,955
Come here, sweetheart.

200
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:39,074
You know. . .

201
00:13:40,155 --> 00:13:42,953
. . .I think it's time for you
to start using night cream.

202
00:13:49,025 --> 00:13:49,821
What?

203
00:13:50,024 --> 00:13:53,414
Nothing. Just your overcoat sounds
remarkably like Brent Musburger.

204
00:13:54,699 --> 00:13:57,054
Check it out. Giants-Cowboys.

205
00:13:58,095 --> 00:14:00,131
You're watching football at a funeral?

206
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:03,921
No, it's the pregame.
I'm gonna watch it at the reception.

207
00:14:04,807 --> 00:14:07,116
You're a frightening, frightening man.

208
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:11,155
Oh, no! My new Paolo shoes!

209
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:13,117
I hope they're not ruined.

210
00:14:16,753 --> 00:14:19,187
God, what a great day!

211
00:14:19,949 --> 00:14:21,940
What? Weatherwise.

212
00:14:23,305 --> 00:14:24,658
I know.

213
00:14:25,263 --> 00:14:27,618
The air, the trees.

214
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:32,099
Even though Nana's gone,
there's something almost life--

215
00:14:34,053 --> 00:14:35,884
Ross, are you okay?

216
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:37,404
No, I'm fine.

217
00:14:38,608 --> 00:14:40,087
Just. . .

218
00:14:40,326 --> 00:14:42,601
. . .having my worst fear
realized, but. . . .

219
00:14:50,634 --> 00:14:53,546
I'm just checking to see
if the muscle's in spasm.

220
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:57,588
-What? What is it?
-You missed a belt loop.

221
00:14:59,743 --> 00:15:01,779
Okay, it's in spasm.

222
00:15:02,859 --> 00:15:04,531
Here, sweetie. Here.

223
00:15:04,777 --> 00:15:06,813
I took these when I had
my golfing accident.

224
00:15:07,135 --> 00:15:08,011
Thanks, Mom.

225
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:17,193
Sorry.

226
00:15:18,082 --> 00:15:19,561
Hi, I'm Andrea.

227
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,831
I'm Dorothy's daughter.

228
00:15:22,037 --> 00:15:25,427
Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have
no idea who Dorothy is.

229
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,789
Look who's up!

230
00:15:31,147 --> 00:15:31,977
How do you feel?

231
00:15:33,424 --> 00:15:34,743
I feel great.

232
00:15:36,301 --> 00:15:38,496
I feel great. I feel great.

233
00:15:40,016 --> 00:15:41,893
Wow, those pills really worked.

234
00:15:42,294 --> 00:15:45,047
Yeah. Not the first two,
but the second two. . . .

235
00:15:48,487 --> 00:15:50,079
I love you guys.

236
00:15:51,643 --> 00:15:54,919
You guys are the greatest.
I love my sister.

237
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:57,275
I love Pheebs.

238
00:15:58,075 --> 00:15:59,349
That's so nice.

239
00:16:02,071 --> 00:16:03,026
I love you, man.

240
00:16:04,788 --> 00:16:07,177
And listen,
if you wanna be gay, be gay!

241
00:16:10,301 --> 00:16:11,893
It doesn't matter to me.

242
00:16:13,577 --> 00:16:14,566
You were right.

243
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:29,321
I love you the most.

244
00:16:30,797 --> 00:16:34,153
Well, you know who I love the most?

245
00:16:35,632 --> 00:16:36,781
You!

246
00:16:38,828 --> 00:16:40,739
Oh, you don't get it!

247
00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:48,138
What do you got there?

248
00:16:48,497 --> 00:16:51,409
Just a hearing disability.

249
00:16:52,492 --> 00:16:53,322
What's the score?

250
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:57,842
1 7-1 4, Giants.
Three minutes to go in the third.

251
00:16:58,086 --> 00:16:59,075
Beautiful!

252
00:17:07,595 --> 00:17:10,905
Pheebs, could you maybe
hand me a cracker?

253
00:17:13,468 --> 00:17:15,299
Your grandmother would've hated this.

254
00:17:16,305 --> 00:17:19,138
Well, sure. What with it
being her funeral and all.

255
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:23,534
No, I'd be hearing about. . .

256
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:26,336
. . .why didn't I get
the honey-glazed ham.

257
00:17:26,573 --> 00:17:30,009
Or I didn't spend enough on flowers.
If I spent more, she'd say. . .

258
00:17:30,288 --> 00:17:33,485
. . . ''Why waste your money?
I don't need flowers, I'm dead. ''

259
00:17:34,364 --> 00:17:36,002
That sounds like Nana.

260
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,874
Do you know what it's like
to grow up. . .

261
00:17:40,437 --> 00:17:44,635
. . .with someone who is critical
of every single thing you say?

262
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,264
I can imagine.

263
00:17:49,426 --> 00:17:52,179
I tell you, it's a wonder
your mother turned out. . .

264
00:17:52,423 --> 00:17:55,415
. . .to be the positive,
life-affirming person she is.

265
00:17:57,137 --> 00:17:59,048
That is a wonder!

266
00:18:01,532 --> 00:18:06,128
So tell me something, Mom.
If you had to do it all over again. . .

267
00:18:06,367 --> 00:18:09,279
. . .I mean, if she was here right now. . .

268
00:18:09,803 --> 00:18:10,952
. . .would you tell her?

269
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,516
Tell her what?

270
00:18:13,918 --> 00:18:18,230
How she drove you crazy,
picking on every little detail.

271
00:18:18,632 --> 00:18:20,429
Like your hair, for example.

272
00:18:21,229 --> 00:18:24,699
I'm not sure I know
what you're getting at.

273
00:18:26,104 --> 00:18:29,540
Would things have been better
if you'd just told her the truth?

274
00:18:36,212 --> 00:18:38,407
I think some things are
better left unsaid.

275
00:18:38,649 --> 00:18:41,402
I think it's nicer when people
just get along.

276
00:18:45,401 --> 00:18:46,390
More wine?

277
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,398
Oh, I think so.

278
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:58,863
Those earrings look
really lovely on you.

279
00:19:01,023 --> 00:19:02,138
Thank you.

280
00:19:03,061 --> 00:19:04,130
They're yours.

281
00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:07,015
Actually, they were Nana's.

282
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:13,169
Now I'm depressed!

283
00:19:17,444 --> 00:19:19,560
Even more than I was.

284
00:19:26,993 --> 00:19:28,949
Hey, who's this little naked guy?

285
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,187
That little naked guy would be me.

286
00:19:32,826 --> 00:19:34,418
Look at the little thing!

287
00:19:37,141 --> 00:19:39,609
Yes, fine.
That is my penis.

288
00:19:40,378 --> 00:19:42,130
Can we be grownups now?

289
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:44,168
Who are those people?

290
00:19:44,413 --> 00:19:45,209
Got me.

291
00:19:45,492 --> 00:19:47,926
That's Nana right there in the middle.

292
00:19:48,968 --> 00:19:50,083
Yeah, let's see.

293
00:19:50,326 --> 00:19:52,886
''Me and the gang at Java Joe's. ''

294
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,153
Monica, you look just like
your grandmother.

295
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,515
How old was she there?

296
00:19:56,719 --> 00:19:58,550
Let's see, '' 1 939. ''

297
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,714
Twenty-four, twenty-five.

298
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,664
It looks like a fun gang.

299
00:20:09,304 --> 00:20:12,341
Look, look, look!
I got Monica naked!

300
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,973
Let me see!

301
00:20:16,096 --> 00:20:18,291
No, no. That would be me again.

302
00:20:22,968 --> 00:20:25,198
I'm just trying something.

303
00:20:36,073 --> 00:20:37,028
Hey, Lowell.

304
00:20:37,351 --> 00:20:38,625
Oh, hey, Chandler.

305
00:20:40,748 --> 00:20:43,103
So how's it going in
Financial Services?

306
00:20:43,345 --> 00:20:46,496
It's like Mardi gras without
the papier-mâché heads.

307
00:20:46,741 --> 00:20:47,776
How about you?

308
00:20:47,979 --> 00:20:49,856
Good. Good. Listen. . .

309
00:20:51,655 --> 00:20:54,647
. . .I don't know what Shelly told you
about me, but. . .

310
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:57,049
. . .I'm not.

311
00:20:58,127 --> 00:21:00,243
I know. That's what I told her.

312
00:21:00,724 --> 00:21:01,839
Really?

313
00:21:03,122 --> 00:21:04,794
So you can tell?

314
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:10,796
Pretty much. Most of the time.
We have a kind of radar.

315
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,467
So you don't think I have. . .

316
00:21:14,668 --> 00:21:15,498
. . .a quaIity?

317
00:21:16,306 --> 00:21:20,140
Speaking for my people,
I'd have to say no.

318
00:21:22,579 --> 00:21:25,696
By the way, your friend, Brian,
from Payroll? He is.

319
00:21:26,295 --> 00:21:27,250
He is?

320
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,284
And way out of your league.

321
00:21:32,887 --> 00:21:34,400
Out of my league!

322
00:21:34,645 --> 00:21:38,604
I could get a Brian. If I wanted to
get a Brian, I could get a Brian.

323
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,598
Hey, Brian.
