1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,870
Would you let it go?
It's not a big deal.

2
00:00:03,119 --> 00:00:04,791
Not a big deal?
It's amazing.

3
00:00:05,039 --> 00:00:07,792
You reach in, there's one
little maneuver, and bam!

4
00:00:07,998 --> 00:00:10,114
A bra. Right out the sleeve.

5
00:00:10,517 --> 00:00:11,791
As far as I'm concerned. . .

6
00:00:12,036 --> 00:00:15,153
. . .there is nothing a guy can do
that comes close. Right?

7
00:00:15,395 --> 00:00:16,225
Come on!

8
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:18,227
You guys can pee standing up.

9
00:00:18,474 --> 00:00:20,590
We can? Okay, I'm trying that.

10
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:23,792
You know what blows my mind?

11
00:00:23,992 --> 00:00:27,109
Women can see breasts
anytime they want.

12
00:00:29,231 --> 00:00:31,301
You just look down,
and there they are.

13
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,944
How you get any work done
is beyond me.

14
00:00:35,389 --> 00:00:38,745
What I don't get is the way
guys can do so many mean things. . .

15
00:00:38,948 --> 00:00:40,301
. . .and then not even care.

16
00:00:46,905 --> 00:00:48,941
Multiple orgasms!

17
00:00:53,023 --> 00:00:55,059
The One With
the East German Laundry Detergent

19
00:01:42,367 --> 00:01:44,085
Saturday night. The big night!

20
00:01:44,326 --> 00:01:47,318
Date night!
Saturday night. Saturday night!

21
00:01:49,325 --> 00:01:51,520
-No plans, huh?
-Not a one!

22
00:01:52,604 --> 00:01:54,435
Not even breaking up
with Janice?

23
00:01:54,683 --> 00:01:56,833
Right, right. Shut up.

24
00:01:58,602 --> 00:02:01,275
Chandler, nobody likes
breaking up with someone.

25
00:02:01,561 --> 00:02:04,951
-You just gotta do it.
-I know. But it's just so hard.

26
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,033
You're sitting with her.
She has no idea what's happening.

27
00:02:08,279 --> 00:02:10,634
You finally get up
the courage to do it.

28
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,029
There's that awkward moment
when you've handed her the note.

29
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:19,746
Why do you have to break up with her?

30
00:02:19,955 --> 00:02:22,469
Be a man. Just stop calling.

31
00:02:24,953 --> 00:02:26,830
If you want, I'll do it with you.

32
00:02:27,352 --> 00:02:30,549
Thanks, but she'd feel like
we were ganging up on her.

33
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:33,305
You break up with Janice.
I'll break up with Tony.

34
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,903
You're breaking up with Tony?

35
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,710
He's sweet, but it's just
not fun anymore.

36
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:41,100
I don't know if it's me or
his hunger strike. I don't know.

37
00:02:43,387 --> 00:02:44,820
Do you want anything else?

38
00:02:45,067 --> 00:02:49,379
You had a nutty, chocolate-y,
kind of cake-y, pie thing that--

39
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:52,418
Nothing. I'm fine.

40
00:02:54,944 --> 00:02:56,821
What's the matter?
Why so scrunchie?

41
00:02:57,423 --> 00:03:00,335
My father wants to give me
a Mercedes convertible.

42
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:04,293
That guy, he burns me up.

43
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,732
Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes
if I move back home.

44
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,777
It was horrible!
He called me ''young lady. ''

45
00:03:11,018 --> 00:03:13,293
I hate when my father
calls me that.

46
00:03:14,377 --> 00:03:17,494
Did he give you that
''You're not up to this'' thing again?

47
00:03:17,696 --> 00:03:20,574
I got the extended disco
version with choruses of. . .

48
00:03:20,775 --> 00:03:22,572
. . . ''You'll Never Make it on Your Own. ''

49
00:03:27,453 --> 00:03:28,886
Hi, Joey.

50
00:03:30,092 --> 00:03:31,207
Oh, my God! Angela!

51
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:34,484
Wow! Being dumped by you
obviously agrees with her.

52
00:03:34,731 --> 00:03:36,528
-Are you gonna go over there?
-No.

53
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,723
Yeah. No.

54
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:42,687
Okay, but not yet.
I don't wanna seem too eager.

55
00:03:45,567 --> 00:03:48,081
One Mississippi, two Mississippi. . .

56
00:03:48,486 --> 00:03:50,442
. . .three Mississippi.
That seems cool.

57
00:03:54,644 --> 00:03:55,872
Hey, Angela.

58
00:03:57,323 --> 00:03:58,472
You look good.

59
00:03:58,963 --> 00:04:01,875
Because I'm wearing a dress
that accents my boobs.

60
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:10,234
You don't say.

61
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:14,507
So, Rachel, what are you
doing tonight?

62
00:04:14,758 --> 00:04:18,068
Big glamour night.
Me and Monica at Launderama.

63
00:04:19,636 --> 00:04:22,867
You wanna hear a freakish coincidence?

64
00:04:23,075 --> 00:04:24,827
Guess who's doing laundry there too?

65
00:04:25,554 --> 00:04:26,907
-Who?
-Me!

66
00:04:27,673 --> 00:04:29,425
Was that not clear?

67
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:33,900
Why don't. . . .

68
00:04:34,111 --> 00:04:37,103
Why don't I just
join you both there?

69
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,665
Don't you have a laundry room
in your building?

70
00:04:43,548 --> 00:04:46,267
I do have a laundry room
in my building.

71
00:04:49,146 --> 00:04:50,784
But there's a rat problem.

72
00:04:51,026 --> 00:04:54,098
Apparently, they're attracted to
the dryer sheets.

73
00:04:54,305 --> 00:04:57,058
They're going in fine,
but they're coming out all. . .

74
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:58,774
. . .fluffy.

75
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:02,691
Anyway, 7-ish?

76
00:05:03,142 --> 00:05:04,018
Sure.

77
00:05:07,061 --> 00:05:09,052
Forget it, Joey.
I'm with Bob now.

78
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,490
Bob? Who the hell's Bob?

79
00:05:11,739 --> 00:05:13,058
Bob is great.

80
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:16,296
He's smart, sophisticated,
and he has a real job.

81
00:05:16,538 --> 00:05:20,292
You go on three auditions a month
and call yourself an actor. But Bob--

82
00:05:20,496 --> 00:05:23,408
Come on! We were great together.

83
00:05:23,655 --> 00:05:27,853
And not just at the fun stuff,
but, like, talking too.

84
00:05:31,093 --> 00:05:33,766
Sorry, Joey. You said,
''Let's just be friends. ''

85
00:05:34,012 --> 00:05:35,411
So guess what?

86
00:05:35,611 --> 00:05:37,647
-What?
-We're just friends.

87
00:05:38,131 --> 00:05:39,484
Fine. Fine.

88
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:43,325
Why don't the four of us have
dinner tonight? You know, as friends.

89
00:05:43,569 --> 00:05:44,843
What ''four of us''?

90
00:05:45,088 --> 00:05:48,398
You and Bob,
and me and my girlfriend. . .

91
00:05:50,287 --> 00:05:51,083
. . .Monica.

92
00:05:51,286 --> 00:05:54,084
I'm telling you, this guy
is perfect for you.

93
00:05:54,285 --> 00:05:57,914
Forget it! Not after your cousin
who could belch the alphabet.

94
00:05:58,804 --> 00:06:02,479
Come on, this guy's great.
His name's Bob. He's Angela's. . .

95
00:06:02,723 --> 00:06:03,792
. . .brother.

96
00:06:04,002 --> 00:06:05,958
He's smart, he's sophisticated. . .

97
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:07,873
. . .and he has a real job.

98
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:11,875
I go on three auditions a month
and call myself an actor, but Bob is--

99
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,633
-Oh, God help us.
-What?

100
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:16,273
Ugly Naked Guy is laying kitchen tile.

101
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:22,226
Look, I'm asking a favor here.

102
00:06:22,436 --> 00:06:24,825
I'm thinking if I do this
for her brother. . .

103
00:06:25,075 --> 00:06:26,827
. . .maybe Angela will come back to me.

104
00:06:27,075 --> 00:06:30,226
What's going on here?
You go out with tons of girls.

105
00:06:30,434 --> 00:06:31,833
I know, but. . . .

106
00:06:33,713 --> 00:06:38,025
Look, I made a huge mistake.
I never should've broke up with her.

107
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,461
Will you help me? Please?

108
00:06:49,228 --> 00:06:52,664
Monica's not coming.
It's just gonna be me and Rachel.

109
00:06:53,986 --> 00:06:56,944
Hold on there, camper.
You've thought this through?

110
00:06:57,185 --> 00:07:00,222
It's laundry. The thinking
through is pretty minimal.

111
00:07:01,304 --> 00:07:03,340
Just you and Rachel?
Just the two of you?

112
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:05,733
This is a date.
You're going on a date.

113
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,215
What are you saying?

114
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:16,768
I should shave again?
Pick up some wine?

115
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:20,216
Well, you may wanna rethink
the dirty underwear.

116
00:07:21,457 --> 00:07:25,416
It's the first time she'll see your
underwear. You want it to be dirty?

117
00:07:32,214 --> 00:07:34,284
And the fabric softener?

118
00:07:35,093 --> 00:07:37,163
Now, what is wrong with my Snuggles?

119
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:42,206
What? It says I'm a sensitive,
warm kind of guy.

120
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,805
You know, like a little fuzzy bear.

121
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:49,198
I can pick something else
up on the way.

122
00:07:53,847 --> 00:07:54,643
Thank you.

123
00:07:54,846 --> 00:07:57,963
So what does this Bob guy
look like? Is he tall, short?

124
00:07:58,565 --> 00:07:59,998
Yep.

125
00:08:00,964 --> 00:08:01,760
Which?

126
00:08:02,204 --> 00:08:03,398
Which what?

127
00:08:04,843 --> 00:08:06,879
You've never met Bob, have you?

128
00:08:07,282 --> 00:08:08,112
No, but--

129
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,637
For all we know,
he could be horribly--

130
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,791
Horribly attractive.
I'll be shutting up now.

131
00:08:20,638 --> 00:08:22,788
Where are they? Where are they?

132
00:08:22,997 --> 00:08:26,194
This is nice. We never
do anything, just the two of us.

133
00:08:26,796 --> 00:08:30,789
That's great. Maybe tomorrow we can
rent a car, run over some puppies.

134
00:08:31,274 --> 00:08:32,468
I don't wanna do that.

135
00:08:35,113 --> 00:08:37,752
-Here we go.
-Have a good breakup.

136
00:08:39,432 --> 00:08:42,902
-Hey, Janice.
-My God, I am so glad you called me.

137
00:08:43,111 --> 00:08:46,228
I had the most supremely awful day.

138
00:08:47,469 --> 00:08:48,743
That's not good.

139
00:08:50,148 --> 00:08:52,981
Can I get an espresso
and a latte over here, please?

140
00:08:53,227 --> 00:08:56,025
We got the proofs from that
photo shoot with the vegetables.

141
00:08:56,266 --> 00:08:57,221
They sucked.

142
00:08:57,466 --> 00:09:00,344
I blew off the rest of the afternoon.
I went shopping.

143
00:09:00,585 --> 00:09:03,383
And I got you. . . .

144
00:09:03,624 --> 00:09:06,457
I'm looking. I'm looking.

145
00:09:06,863 --> 00:09:08,899
I'm looking.

146
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:10,810
-I got you--
-What?

147
00:09:11,022 --> 00:09:14,571
-What?
-What did you get me there?

148
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,169
I got you. . .

149
00:09:17,659 --> 00:09:18,978
. . .these.

150
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:21,610
Bullwinkle socks.

151
00:09:21,858 --> 00:09:24,133
-That's so sweet.
-I knew you had the Rockys.

152
00:09:24,377 --> 00:09:26,368
So you could wear
Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle. . .

153
00:09:26,616 --> 00:09:29,574
. . .or wear Rocky and Rocky,
or you can mix and match.

154
00:09:29,775 --> 00:09:31,572
Moose and squirrel.

155
00:09:31,775 --> 00:09:33,572
Whatever you want.

156
00:09:37,453 --> 00:09:40,013
I'm gonna get another espresso.
More latte?

157
00:09:43,011 --> 00:09:45,969
No, I'm still working on mine.

158
00:09:50,609 --> 00:09:51,405
That's it?

159
00:09:51,648 --> 00:09:53,001
Yeah, it was really hard.

160
00:09:53,448 --> 00:09:55,279
The hug looked pretty brutal.

161
00:09:55,927 --> 00:09:57,155
You weren't there.

162
00:10:09,523 --> 00:10:11,753
Coming through! Move! Move!

163
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,991
Excuse me! I was kind of
using that machine.

164
00:10:20,239 --> 00:10:22,548
Yeah, well, now you're kind of not.

165
00:10:23,718 --> 00:10:26,471
But I saved it.
I put my basket on top.

166
00:10:26,717 --> 00:10:29,072
I'm sorry.
Is that your basket?

167
00:10:29,316 --> 00:10:32,194
It's really pretty.
Unfortunately, I don't see suds!

168
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,589
What?

169
00:10:36,754 --> 00:10:39,791
No suds, no save, okay?

170
00:10:42,552 --> 00:10:43,951
What's going on?

171
00:10:44,151 --> 00:10:47,746
Nothing. This horrible woman
just took my machine.

172
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,429
Was your basket on top?

173
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,786
-Yeah, but there were no suds.
-So?

174
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:53,462
You know, no suds, no save.

175
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,585
No suds, no--
Excuse me.

176
00:10:55,828 --> 00:10:57,341
Hold on a second!

177
00:10:57,547 --> 00:10:59,617
This is my friend's machine.

178
00:10:59,866 --> 00:11:01,936
Hey, hey, hey!
Her stuff wasn't in it!

179
00:11:02,185 --> 00:11:06,019
Hey, hey, hey! That's not
the rule, and you know it!

180
00:11:16,101 --> 00:11:17,580
All right. Show's over.

181
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,536
Nothing to see here.

182
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:26,937
Let's do laundry.

183
00:11:27,137 --> 00:11:30,766
That was amazing!
I can't even send back soup.

184
00:11:31,016 --> 00:11:35,328
Well, that's because you're
such a sweet, gentle. . . .

185
00:11:39,493 --> 00:11:41,290
You must need detergent.

186
00:11:45,092 --> 00:11:46,969
-What's that?
-Uberweiss.

187
00:11:47,891 --> 00:11:50,883
It's new. It's German.
It's extra tough!

188
00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:55,000
Are you gonna separate those?

189
00:11:56,528 --> 00:11:57,927
Oh, God.

190
00:11:58,687 --> 00:12:00,962
Am I being like a total laundry spaz?

191
00:12:01,206 --> 00:12:04,881
Am I supposed to use one machine
for shirts and another for pants?

192
00:12:09,204 --> 00:12:11,240
Have you never done this before?

193
00:12:11,483 --> 00:12:14,475
Well, not myself.
But I know other people that have.

194
00:12:16,201 --> 00:12:19,113
Okay. You caught me.
I'm a laundry virgin.

195
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,678
Don't worry.
I'll use the gentle cycle.

196
00:12:28,198 --> 00:12:31,827
Basically, you wanna use
one machine for all your whites.

197
00:12:32,996 --> 00:12:35,146
A whole other machine
for your colors.

198
00:12:35,395 --> 00:12:38,114
And a third for your. . .

199
00:12:39,994 --> 00:12:42,554
. . .delicates.
And that would be your bras. . .

200
00:12:42,793 --> 00:12:45,910
. . .and your underpanty things.

201
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,907
These are white cotton panties.

202
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,499
Would they go with whites
or with delicates?

203
00:12:54,109 --> 00:12:56,100
That would be a judgment call.

204
00:13:01,067 --> 00:13:02,785
He's so cute!

205
00:13:04,626 --> 00:13:06,264
So where did you guys grow up?

206
00:13:06,505 --> 00:13:08,496
-Brooklyn Heights.
-Cleveland.

207
00:13:10,064 --> 00:13:11,782
-How did that happen?
-Oh, my God!

208
00:13:12,143 --> 00:13:13,496
What?

209
00:13:13,983 --> 00:13:16,133
I suddenly had the feeling I was. . .

210
00:13:16,382 --> 00:13:17,895
. . .falling.

211
00:13:19,261 --> 00:13:20,171
But I'm not.

212
00:13:30,257 --> 00:13:32,327
So, you and Angela, huh?

213
00:13:32,577 --> 00:13:34,693
Yep. Pretty much.

214
00:13:35,096 --> 00:13:36,495
You're a lucky man.

215
00:13:37,575 --> 00:13:39,531
You know what I miss
the most about her?

216
00:13:39,774 --> 00:13:42,891
That cute nibbley noise
she makes when she eats.

217
00:13:43,093 --> 00:13:46,051
Like a happy little squirrel. . .

218
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,284
. . .or a weasel.

219
00:13:49,651 --> 00:13:51,004
I never really noticed.

220
00:13:51,211 --> 00:13:53,520
Oh, yeah, yeah. Listen for it.

221
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,281
Monica. Monica is great.

222
00:13:56,529 --> 00:13:58,679
Yeah, she is.

223
00:13:58,928 --> 00:14:00,998
But it's not gonna last.

224
00:14:02,647 --> 00:14:04,877
She's too much for me in bed.

225
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:07,001
Sexually.

226
00:14:10,564 --> 00:14:13,317
I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.

227
00:14:13,563 --> 00:14:14,791
Yeah, isn't he?

228
00:14:15,043 --> 00:14:17,796
It's so great to meet a guy
who's smart and funny. . .

229
00:14:18,042 --> 00:14:20,272
. . .and has an emotional age beyond 8.

230
00:14:20,521 --> 00:14:23,877
You know what else?
He's unbelievable in bed!

231
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:30,791
My brother never even told me
when he lost his virginity.

232
00:14:33,837 --> 00:14:35,031
That's nice.

233
00:14:40,075 --> 00:14:42,908
You can do this. It's like
pulling off a Band-Aid.

234
00:14:43,154 --> 00:14:46,988
Just do it really fast,
and then the wound is exposed.

235
00:14:47,233 --> 00:14:48,666
Go! Go!

236
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:02,137
Hi, Janice.

237
00:15:03,627 --> 00:15:05,902
I don't think we should
go out anymore.

238
00:15:14,144 --> 00:15:15,463
All right.

239
00:15:19,942 --> 00:15:21,660
Well, there you go.

240
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,979
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

241
00:15:28,419 --> 00:15:31,456
I know this is gonna sound
really stupid. . .

242
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:33,848
. . .but I feel that if I can do this. . .

243
00:15:34,097 --> 00:15:36,850
. . .if I can actually do
my own laundry. . .

244
00:15:37,056 --> 00:15:38,853
. . .there isn't anything I can't do.

245
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:42,050
That does not sound stupid to me.

246
00:15:43,214 --> 00:15:47,207
The first time I had to make dinner
for myself after Carol left me. . . .

247
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:51,247
I'm sorry, that's all the time
we have. Next on Ross. . . .

248
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:54,125
-Uh-oh.
-What, ''uh-oh''?

249
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:55,440
Uh-oh. . . .

250
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:58,448
Uh-oh, the laundry's done.

251
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:01,481
It's a song.

252
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:03,480
The laundry song that we sing.

253
00:16:04,487 --> 00:16:07,684
Uh-oh! The laundry's done

254
00:16:08,646 --> 00:16:09,476
What's the matter?

255
00:16:09,726 --> 00:16:10,761
Nothing. Nothing.

256
00:16:11,005 --> 00:16:12,279
The laundry's done

257
00:16:12,525 --> 00:16:13,560
Come on, show me.

258
00:16:13,804 --> 00:16:17,717
It's just that you left a red sock
in with your whites, and now. . .

259
00:16:20,322 --> 00:16:22,438
. . .everything's kind of pink.

260
00:16:23,841 --> 00:16:25,160
Everything's pink?

261
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,040
Except for the red sock,
which is still red.

262
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,869
Don't be upset.
It can happen to anyone.

263
00:16:31,119 --> 00:16:32,916
But it didn't.
It happened to me.

264
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:36,594
God, I'm gonna look like
a big Marshmallow Peep!

265
00:16:36,797 --> 00:16:38,549
What am I doing? What am I doing?

266
00:16:38,796 --> 00:16:41,833
My father's right!
I can't live on my own.

267
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:44,424
I can't even do laundry!

268
00:16:55,471 --> 00:16:57,268
Something went wrong
with Underdog. . .

269
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,626
. . .and they couldn't get
his head to inflate.

270
00:17:00,909 --> 00:17:02,422
So anyway. . .

271
00:17:03,628 --> 00:17:06,301
. . .his head is, like,
flopping down Broadway.

272
00:17:07,387 --> 00:17:08,422
And I'm thinking. . .

273
00:17:09,586 --> 00:17:12,225
. . .how inappropriate this is.

274
00:17:12,585 --> 00:17:16,419
Something's in my eye. Could we
check it in the light, please?

275
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:20,976
-Oh, my God!
-What?

276
00:17:21,223 --> 00:17:23,817
Hello! Were we at
the same table? It's like. . .

277
00:17:24,022 --> 00:17:26,217
. . .cocktails in Appalachia.

278
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,336
They're close.

279
00:17:31,579 --> 00:17:34,537
Close? She's got her
tongue in his ear.

280
00:17:35,298 --> 00:17:39,132
Like you've never got a little
rambunctious with Ross.

281
00:17:40,296 --> 00:17:43,845
Joey, this is sick.
It's disgusting. It's. . .

282
00:17:44,655 --> 00:17:46,247
. . .not really true, is it?

283
00:17:46,494 --> 00:17:48,086
Who's to say what's true?

284
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:49,369
What were you thinking?

285
00:17:49,613 --> 00:17:52,047
I'm not proud of this, okay?

286
00:17:52,292 --> 00:17:53,645
Maybe I am a little.

287
00:17:55,651 --> 00:17:57,448
-I'm out of here!
-Wait! Come on!

288
00:17:57,651 --> 00:17:59,448
You like him. I want her.

289
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:01,043
He likes you.

290
00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:02,605
Really?

291
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:07,398
I'm thinking, if we put our heads
together, between the two of us. . .

292
00:18:07,608 --> 00:18:09,599
. . .we can break them up.

293
00:18:12,326 --> 00:18:14,635
I'm so sorry.
I can't believe I did this.

294
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:18,195
I just couldn't stop laughing
at your Norman Mailer story.

295
00:18:24,282 --> 00:18:27,399
Waiter? One more plate of
chicken wings over here.

296
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:35,714
Here's the thing.
It's like we're different.

297
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:39,030
I'm the bing, bing, bing.
You're the boom, boom, boom.

298
00:18:39,277 --> 00:18:40,596
Oh, my God!

299
00:18:40,837 --> 00:18:41,713
I'm so sorry!

300
00:18:42,196 --> 00:18:43,515
Are you okay?

301
00:18:44,676 --> 00:18:46,632
It's just my lens. It's my lens.

302
00:18:47,395 --> 00:18:48,794
I'll be right back.

303
00:18:51,073 --> 00:18:53,303
I hit her in the eye!
I hit her in the eye!

304
00:18:53,553 --> 00:18:56,909
This is the worst breakup
in the history of the world!

305
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,823
Oh, my God!

306
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,269
How many have you had?

307
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,580
I don't know. A million!

308
00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:08,546
Chandler, easy, easy.
Go to your happy place.

309
00:19:11,947 --> 00:19:14,222
-I'm fine, I'm fine.
-All right.

310
00:19:14,426 --> 00:19:16,178
I'm not fine. Here she comes.

311
00:19:16,385 --> 00:19:18,137
Wait here, okay? Breathe.

312
00:19:36,339 --> 00:19:37,613
How do you do that?

313
00:19:37,858 --> 00:19:39,814
It's like a gift.

314
00:19:42,377 --> 00:19:44,607
We should always break up together.

315
00:19:44,856 --> 00:19:45,925
I'd like that!

316
00:19:47,975 --> 00:19:50,967
You got the clothes clean.
That's the important part.

317
00:19:51,174 --> 00:19:54,405
I guess. Except everything
looks like jammies now.

318
00:20:00,251 --> 00:20:01,206
I'm sorry.

319
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:03,840
Excuse me. We had this cart.

320
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:07,124
I had a 24-inch waist.
You lose things.

321
00:20:07,329 --> 00:20:09,524
Now, come on.
Get out of my way.

322
00:20:09,768 --> 00:20:13,238
I'm sorry. Maybe I wasn't
being clear. This was our cart.

323
00:20:13,527 --> 00:20:15,404
There aren't any clothes in it!

324
00:20:15,646 --> 00:20:18,114
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Quit making up rules!

325
00:20:18,365 --> 00:20:20,356
Let go! Come on, it's my cart.

326
00:20:21,844 --> 00:20:23,960
Listen, Mitzi, if you
want this cart. . .

327
00:20:24,163 --> 00:20:26,597
. . .you're gonna have to
take me with it!

328
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,397
Yes! Did you see that?

329
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,789
You were incredible.

330
00:20:36,999 --> 00:20:39,388
A brand-new woman,
ladies and gentlemen.

331
00:20:39,598 --> 00:20:41,873
I could not have
done this without you.

332
00:20:50,395 --> 00:20:52,147
More clothes in the dryer?

333
00:20:54,313 --> 00:20:56,349
-I'm fine. I'm fine.
-Are you sure?

334
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:02,746
Are you sure you're okay?

335
00:21:03,031 --> 00:21:04,942
Does it still hurt?

336
00:21:07,469 --> 00:21:11,144
What a neat idea. All your
clothes match. I'm gonna do this.

337
00:21:14,027 --> 00:21:14,982
How'd it go?

338
00:21:15,227 --> 00:21:16,216
Excellent!

339
00:21:16,466 --> 00:21:20,539
We ripped that couple apart
and kept the pieces for ourselves.

340
00:21:21,745 --> 00:21:23,019
What a beautiful story.

341
00:21:25,423 --> 00:21:26,617
I'm fine, by the way.

342
00:21:26,863 --> 00:21:28,137
I'm sorry.

343
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:29,498
Where's Chandler?

344
00:21:29,742 --> 00:21:31,414
