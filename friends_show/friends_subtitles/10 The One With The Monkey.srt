1
00:00:05,667 --> 00:00:08,977
Guys? There's somebody
I'd like you to meet.

2
00:00:11,461 --> 00:00:13,099
Wait, wait. What is that?

3
00:00:13,299 --> 00:00:14,891
That's Marcel. Wanna say hi?

4
00:00:15,137 --> 00:00:16,286
No, I don't.

5
00:00:16,496 --> 00:00:18,487
He is precious!
Where did you get him?

6
00:00:18,734 --> 00:00:20,725
My friend Bethel rescued him
from some lab.

7
00:00:20,971 --> 00:00:22,290
That is so cruel.

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,567
Why? Why would a parent
name their child Bethel?

9
00:00:28,563 --> 00:00:30,394
That monkey's got a Ross on his ass!

10
00:00:35,516 --> 00:00:38,314
Is he gonna live with you,
like, in your apartment?

11
00:00:38,553 --> 00:00:41,511
It's been kind of quiet
since Carol left, so. . . .

12
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,468
Why don't you just get a roommate?

13
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:45,465
I don't know.
You reach a certain age. . .

14
00:00:45,706 --> 00:00:47,776
. . .having a roommate
is just kind of pathe--

15
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,576
Sorry, that's ''pathet,'' which is
Sanskrit for ''cool way to live. ''

16
00:00:56,694 --> 00:00:58,730
The One With the Monkey

17
00:01:00,011 --> 00:01:01,000
English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

18
00:01:44,885 --> 00:01:46,637
I'm doing all-new material tonight.

19
00:01:47,202 --> 00:01:51,400
I have 12 new songs about my mother's
suicide and one about a snowman.

20
00:01:53,596 --> 00:01:55,587
Might want to open with the snowman.

21
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,703
So how'd it go?

22
00:02:01,987 --> 00:02:03,545
I didn't get the job.

23
00:02:04,544 --> 00:02:07,342
How could you not get it?
You were Santa last year!

24
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,573
I don't know. Some fat guy's
sleeping with the store manager.

25
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:15,252
He's not even jolly.
It's all political.

26
00:02:16,412 --> 00:02:17,561
What are you gonna be?

27
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:19,568
I'm gonna be one of his helpers.

28
00:02:19,809 --> 00:02:22,642
It's just such a slap in the face,
you know?

29
00:02:23,045 --> 00:02:25,764
Hey, do you guys know
what you're doing for New Year's?

30
00:02:27,161 --> 00:02:29,834
Hey, what? What is wrong
with New Year's?

31
00:02:30,078 --> 00:02:34,151
Nothing for you. You have Paolo.
You don't have to face the pressure. . .

32
00:02:34,394 --> 00:02:38,182
. . .of finding anything with lips
to kiss when the ball drops!

33
00:02:38,429 --> 00:02:39,987
Man, I'm talking loud!

34
00:02:41,506 --> 00:02:44,942
For your information, Paolo's
gonna be in Rome this New Year's.

35
00:02:45,183 --> 00:02:47,219
I'll be just as pathetic
as the rest of you.

36
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,939
Yeah, you wish.

37
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,890
I'm sick of being a victim
this Dick Clark holiday.

38
00:02:54,093 --> 00:02:56,527
I say this year, no dates,
we make a pact.

39
00:02:56,771 --> 00:02:58,648
Just the six of us. Dinner.

40
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,527
-Sure.
-Fine.

41
00:03:00,766 --> 00:03:02,996
I was hoping for a little
more enthusiasm.

42
00:03:05,761 --> 00:03:06,557
You're on.

43
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,119
Oh, good.

44
00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:11,749
Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen,
back by popular demand. . .

45
00:03:11,995 --> 00:03:14,225
. . .Miss Phoebe Buffay.

46
00:03:18,588 --> 00:03:19,737
Thanks. Hi.

47
00:03:20,586 --> 00:03:24,261
I want to start with a song that
means a lot to me this time of year.

48
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:32,335
I made a man with eyes of coal

49
00:03:32,574 --> 00:03:35,646
And a smile so bewitchin '

50
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,718
How was I supposed to know

51
00:03:38,967 --> 00:03:41,720
That my mom was dead in the kitchen?

52
00:03:48,557 --> 00:03:50,832
My mother's ashes

53
00:03:51,354 --> 00:03:54,107
Even her eyelashes

54
00:03:54,471 --> 00:03:58,669
Are resting in a little yellow jar

55
00:04:02,663 --> 00:04:05,382
And sometimes when it's freezing

56
00:04:06,698 --> 00:04:08,177
I feel a little sneezy

57
00:04:08,896 --> 00:04:11,251
And now I--
Excuse me? Excuse me?

58
00:04:11,494 --> 00:04:12,290
Noisy boys.

59
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,603
Is it something you'd like
to share with the group?

60
00:04:20,524 --> 00:04:22,003
No, that's okay.

61
00:04:22,202 --> 00:04:25,035
If it's important enough
to discuss while I'm playing. . .

62
00:04:25,239 --> 00:04:28,117
. . .I assume it's important enough
for everyone else to hear.

63
00:04:28,316 --> 00:04:30,386
That guy's going home with a note.

64
00:04:36,308 --> 00:04:38,344
-I was just saying--
-Could you speak up?

65
00:04:38,586 --> 00:04:39,701
Sorry.

66
00:04:40,703 --> 00:04:44,332
I was saying you were
the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen.

67
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,210
And you said Daryl Hannah. . .

68
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:50,328
. . .was the most beautiful woman
he'd ever seen.

69
00:04:50,573 --> 00:04:53,610
And I said I liked her in Splash,
but not in Wall Street.

70
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,563
-I thought she had a hard quality.
-A hard quality.

71
00:04:58,485 --> 00:05:00,999
And while Daryl Hannah is beautiful
in a conventional way. . .

72
00:05:01,242 --> 00:05:04,678
. . .you are luminous
with a kind of delicate grace.

73
00:05:07,236 --> 00:05:10,148
Then that's when you started yelling.

74
00:05:17,665 --> 00:05:19,781
Okay, we're gonna take a short break.

75
00:05:23,859 --> 00:05:26,771
I think that guy's going home
with more than a note.

76
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,049
Come here, Marcel. Sit here.

77
00:05:36,965 --> 00:05:39,354
Pheebs, I can't believe
he hasn't kissed you yet.

78
00:05:39,563 --> 00:05:44,398
I mean, by my sixth date with Paolo,
he'd already named both my breasts.

79
00:05:47,834 --> 00:05:50,109
Did I just share too much?

80
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,102
Just a smidge.

81
00:05:53,828 --> 00:05:57,138
David's, like, a scientist guy.
He's very methodical.

82
00:05:57,344 --> 00:05:58,333
I think it's romantic.

83
00:05:58,583 --> 00:05:59,618
Me too!

84
00:06:00,341 --> 00:06:02,172
Did you ever see
An Officer and a Gentleman?

85
00:06:03,578 --> 00:06:06,729
He's kind of like the guy
I went to see that with.

86
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:15,323
Except he's smarter and gentler
and sweeter.

87
00:06:16,644 --> 00:06:18,714
I just want to be
with him all the time.

88
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:22,113
You know, day and night.
And night and day.

89
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,753
And special occasions.

90
00:06:26,994 --> 00:06:29,906
I see where this is going.
You're gonna ask him to New Year's.

91
00:06:30,151 --> 00:06:32,711
You'll break the pact.
She's breaking the pact.

92
00:06:35,345 --> 00:06:37,097
Yeah, could I just. . .?

93
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:41,011
Yeah, because I already asked Janice.

94
00:06:41,858 --> 00:06:44,326
Come on, this was a pact!
This was your pact!

95
00:06:44,576 --> 00:06:47,090
I couldn't handle the pressure
and I snapped!

96
00:06:47,293 --> 00:06:50,126
But Janice?
That was the worst breakup in history!

97
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,804
I'm not saying it was a good idea.
I snapped!

98
00:06:55,724 --> 00:06:57,601
Hi, sorry I'm late.

99
00:07:05,834 --> 00:07:07,665
Too many jokes.

100
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,349
Must mock Joey.

101
00:07:12,787 --> 00:07:14,698
Nice shoes, huh?

102
00:07:15,504 --> 00:07:17,256
God, you're killing me!

103
00:07:20,219 --> 00:07:22,255
He's playing with my spatulas again!

104
00:07:22,457 --> 00:07:24,891
Look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?

105
00:07:25,134 --> 00:07:26,965
Do you always have to bring him here?

106
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,162
I didn't want to leave him alone.

107
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,922
We had our first fight this morning.

108
00:07:34,484 --> 00:07:36,315
It has to do with my working late.

109
00:07:36,562 --> 00:07:39,520
I said some things that I didn't mean.

110
00:07:41,317 --> 00:07:42,432
He threw some feces.

111
00:07:46,712 --> 00:07:48,748
If you're working late,
I can look in on him.

112
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:51,420
That would be great!

113
00:07:51,786 --> 00:07:54,619
But make sure it seems
like you're there to see him. . .

114
00:07:54,863 --> 00:07:57,423
. . .and you're not doing it
as a favor to me.

115
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,572
Okay. But if he asks,
I'm not going to lie.

116
00:08:07,051 --> 00:08:09,281
But you can't actually
test this theory.

117
00:08:09,528 --> 00:08:13,441
Because today's particle accelerators
are nowhere near powerful enough. . .

118
00:08:13,684 --> 00:08:15,595
. . .to simulate these conditions.

119
00:08:15,802 --> 00:08:17,713
All right. I have a question then.

120
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,470
Were you planning on kissing me ever?

121
00:08:24,353 --> 00:08:26,503
That's definitely a valid question. . .

122
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,706
. . .and the answer. . .

123
00:08:28,948 --> 00:08:31,143
. . .would be yes.

124
00:08:31,346 --> 00:08:32,415
Yes, I was.

125
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,971
But see, I wanted it to be
this phenomenal kiss. . .

126
00:08:40,176 --> 00:08:43,009
. . .that happened at this
phenomenal moment because it's you.

127
00:08:43,413 --> 00:08:44,368
Sure.

128
00:08:44,572 --> 00:08:48,360
Right. But the longer I waited,
the more phenomenal the kiss had to be.

129
00:08:48,608 --> 00:08:52,487
And now, it's just got to be
one of those things where I. . .

130
00:08:52,723 --> 00:08:55,795
. . .sweep everything off the table
and throw you down on it.

131
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,554
And I'm not really
a sweeping sort of fella.

132
00:08:58,837 --> 00:09:02,671
Oh, David, I think you are
a ''sweeping sort of fella. ''

133
00:09:03,872 --> 00:09:06,944
I mean, you're a sweeper
trapped inside a physicist's body.

134
00:09:07,988 --> 00:09:09,387
-Really.
-I'm sure of it.

135
00:09:09,626 --> 00:09:12,379
You should just do it.
Just sweep and throw me.

136
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,416
Now?

137
00:09:16,699 --> 00:09:18,212
Right now. Just. . . .

138
00:09:22,613 --> 00:09:25,127
You know what?
This is just really expensive.

139
00:09:26,409 --> 00:09:28,286
And this was a gift.

140
00:09:29,366 --> 00:09:32,199
-Now you're just tidying up.
-Okay, what the hell?

141
00:09:36,398 --> 00:09:39,276
-You want me to actually throw you--?
-I can hop.

142
00:09:54,979 --> 00:09:58,415
Tell me something, what does
''No-Date Pact'' mean to you?

143
00:09:58,656 --> 00:10:02,729
I'm sorry. It's just that Chandler
has somebody and Phoebe has somebody.

144
00:10:02,971 --> 00:10:04,848
I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.

145
00:10:05,049 --> 00:10:07,040
Fun Bobby, your ex-boyfriend,
Fun Bobby?

146
00:10:07,367 --> 00:10:09,881
You know more than one Fun Bobby?

147
00:10:10,164 --> 00:10:11,677
I happen to know a Fun Bob.

148
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,913
Okay. Here we go.

149
00:10:15,158 --> 00:10:17,831
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
There's no room for milk.

150
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,066
There. Now there is.

151
00:10:25,308 --> 00:10:29,540
So on our no-date evening, three
of you now are gonna have dates.

152
00:10:29,983 --> 00:10:30,779
-Four.
-Four.

153
00:10:31,022 --> 00:10:32,250
-Five.
-Five.

154
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,500
Sorry. Paolo's catching
an earlier flight.

155
00:10:35,737 --> 00:10:39,093
And I met this really hot
single mom at the store.

156
00:10:39,733 --> 00:10:41,291
What's an elf to do?

157
00:10:41,971 --> 00:10:46,123
So I'm gonna be the only one standing
there alone when the ball drops?

158
00:10:46,366 --> 00:10:50,041
Come on. We'll have a big party,
and no one will know who's with who.

159
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:52,159
This is so not what I needed now.

160
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,310
What's the matter?

161
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:54,912
Oh, it's Marcel.

162
00:10:57,914 --> 00:10:59,267
He keeps shutting me out.

163
00:10:59,513 --> 00:11:03,028
He's walking around all the time,
dragging his hands.

164
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:06,507
That's weird. I had a blast
with him the other night.

165
00:11:06,705 --> 00:11:08,616
-Really?
-We played. We watched TV.

166
00:11:08,863 --> 00:11:11,252
That juggling thing is amazing.

167
00:11:14,098 --> 00:11:16,009
What juggling thing?

168
00:11:16,655 --> 00:11:19,567
With the balled-up socks?
I figured you taught him that.

169
00:11:22,609 --> 00:11:24,804
It wasn't that big a deal.
Just balled-up socks.

170
00:11:25,486 --> 00:11:26,521
And a melon.

171
00:11:30,761 --> 00:11:32,911
-Phoebe! Hi!
-Hi, Max. Do you know everybody?

172
00:11:33,158 --> 00:11:34,876
No. Have you seen David?

173
00:11:36,275 --> 00:11:37,708
No, he hasn't been around.

174
00:11:37,953 --> 00:11:41,184
If you see him, tell him to pack.
We are going to Minsk.

175
00:11:41,749 --> 00:11:42,579
Minsk?

176
00:11:42,788 --> 00:11:44,380
Minsk. It's in Russia.

177
00:11:45,385 --> 00:11:47,341
I know where Minsk is.

178
00:11:48,662 --> 00:11:49,777
We got the grant!

179
00:11:49,981 --> 00:11:52,700
Three years, all expenses paid.

180
00:11:53,377 --> 00:11:54,605
So when do you leave?

181
00:11:54,856 --> 00:11:55,732
January 1 st.

182
00:12:12,837 --> 00:12:15,749
-What are you doing here?
-Max told me about Minsk.

183
00:12:15,994 --> 00:12:19,191
So, you know, congratulations!
This is so exciting!

184
00:12:20,909 --> 00:12:22,900
It'd be even more exciting,
if we were going.

185
00:12:23,586 --> 00:12:26,100
Oh, you're not going? Oh, why?

186
00:12:27,222 --> 00:12:28,052
Tell her, David.

187
00:12:28,301 --> 00:12:32,533
''I don't want to go to Minsk to work
with Lipson and Yamaguchi and Flank.

188
00:12:32,777 --> 00:12:35,211
I want to stay here and make out
with my girlfriend! ''

189
00:12:35,773 --> 00:12:38,765
Okay, thank you, Max.
Thank you.

190
00:12:40,089 --> 00:12:41,761
So you're really not going?

191
00:12:42,007 --> 00:12:45,044
I don't know. I don't know
what I'm gonna do. I just. . . .

192
00:12:45,843 --> 00:12:46,639
You decide.

193
00:12:47,202 --> 00:12:48,317
-Don't do that.
-Please?

194
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,509
But I'm asking you.

195
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:51,158
I can't make a decision.

196
00:12:51,397 --> 00:12:53,149
-Please, just--
-Okay. Stay.

197
00:12:55,273 --> 00:12:56,672
-Stay.
-Stay.

198
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:06,102
Getting so good at that!

199
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,418
It was Max's stuff.

200
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,120
I love this artichoke thing.

201
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:23,723
Don't tell me what's in it.
The diet starts tomorrow.

202
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,279
You remember Janice.

203
00:13:31,276 --> 00:13:32,425
Vividly.

204
00:13:40,746 --> 00:13:41,576
Hi, I'm Sandy.

205
00:13:41,825 --> 00:13:43,941
Sandy, hi. Come on in.

206
00:13:53,653 --> 00:13:54,449
You brought your kids.

207
00:13:54,692 --> 00:13:56,364
Yeah. That's okay, right?

208
00:13:59,687 --> 00:14:01,006
Party!

209
00:14:01,325 --> 00:14:03,759
That thing is not coming in here!

210
00:14:04,003 --> 00:14:07,234
''That thing''? This is how
you greet guests at a party?

211
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:11,108
If I showed up with my new girlfriend,
she wouldn't be welcome?

212
00:14:11,595 --> 00:14:14,587
Your new girlfriend
wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.

213
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:18,907
He was more embarrassed
about that than anyone.

214
00:14:20,585 --> 00:14:24,260
And for him to have the courage
to walk back in here. . .

215
00:14:25,101 --> 00:14:26,500
. . .like nothing happened. . . .

216
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:30,530
All right. All right.
Just keep him away from me.

217
00:14:30,775 --> 00:14:32,970
Thank you. Come on, Marcel.

218
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,727
What do you say you and I
do a little mingling?

219
00:14:36,849 --> 00:14:38,123
All right. . .

220
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,997
. . .I'll catch up with you later.

221
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:47,951
Oh, my God! Rachel, honey. . .

222
00:14:49,196 --> 00:14:50,754
. . .are you okay?

223
00:14:51,034 --> 00:14:52,023
Where's Paolo?

224
00:14:52,672 --> 00:14:53,661
Rome.

225
00:14:54,071 --> 00:14:55,663
Jerk missed his flight.

226
00:14:56,189 --> 00:14:57,622
And then your face exploded?

227
00:15:02,542 --> 00:15:05,181
I was at the airport
getting into a cab. . .

228
00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:06,698
. . .when this woman. . .

229
00:15:06,938 --> 00:15:09,532
. . .this blond planet
with a pocketbook. . .

230
00:15:10,334 --> 00:15:11,608
. . .starts yelling at me.

231
00:15:11,853 --> 00:15:14,367
Something about how
it was her cab first.

232
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:18,444
The next thing I know, she just
starts pulling me out by my hair!

233
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:21,404
And I started blowing my attack
whistle thingy. . .

234
00:15:21,642 --> 00:15:24,156
. . .and then three more cabs show up.

235
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,797
So as I'm going to get into a cab,
she tackles me!

236
00:15:29,235 --> 00:15:34,150
And I hit my head on the curb
and cut my lip on my whistle.

237
00:15:37,786 --> 00:15:39,902
Everybody having fun at the party?

238
00:15:42,021 --> 00:15:43,136
Are people eating my dip?

239
00:15:52,571 --> 00:15:54,960
When I saw you at the store
last week. . .

240
00:15:55,607 --> 00:15:59,805
. . .it was probably the first time
I ever mentally undressed an elf.

241
00:16:02,001 --> 00:16:03,832
Wow, that's dirty!

242
00:16:09,193 --> 00:16:09,989
Hey, kids.

243
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:15,826
Look at him. I'm not saying he has
to spend the whole evening with me. . .

244
00:16:16,066 --> 00:16:17,738
. . .but at least check in.

245
00:16:19,183 --> 00:16:21,014
There you are!

246
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,020
You got away from me.

247
00:16:25,257 --> 00:16:27,248
But you found me.

248
00:16:27,534 --> 00:16:29,172
Here, Ross, take our picture.

249
00:16:29,373 --> 00:16:32,649
Smile. You're on Janice Camera.

250
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:35,086
Kill me. Kill me now.

251
00:16:38,923 --> 00:16:40,675
Everybody, it's Fun Bobby!

252
00:16:43,758 --> 00:16:44,873
Hey, sorry I'm late.

253
00:16:45,076 --> 00:16:47,067
But my grandfather. . .

254
00:16:47,274 --> 00:16:48,912
. . .died about two hours ago.

255
00:16:49,112 --> 00:16:52,991
But I couldn't get a flight
out till tomorrow, so. . .

256
00:16:53,508 --> 00:16:54,702
. . .here I am.

257
00:16:55,146 --> 00:16:57,341
Hey, Fun Bobby!
How's it going, man?

258
00:16:58,063 --> 00:16:59,257
Whoa! Who died?

259
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:07,289
It's going to be an open casket,
you know?

260
00:17:08,332 --> 00:17:11,130
So at least I'll get to see him again.

261
00:17:13,927 --> 00:17:18,478
I'm gonna blow this one up and
I'm gonna write ''Reunited'' in glitter.

262
00:17:18,722 --> 00:17:20,678
All right, Janice, that's it!

263
00:17:25,275 --> 00:17:28,153
When I invited you, I didn't
think it meant that we--

264
00:17:28,392 --> 00:17:30,542
Oh, no!

265
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,741
-I'm sorry you misunderstood.
-Oh, my God!

266
00:17:37,103 --> 00:17:39,219
You listen to me!
You listen to me!

267
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:44,011
One of these times, it's just gonna be
your last chance with me!

268
00:17:45,894 --> 00:17:47,725
Will you give me the thing?

269
00:17:51,248 --> 00:17:52,044
Hi, Max.

270
00:17:52,487 --> 00:17:53,522
Yoko.

271
00:17:58,361 --> 00:18:01,558
I've decided to go to Minsk
without you.

272
00:18:03,396 --> 00:18:04,988
It won't be the same. . .

273
00:18:06,033 --> 00:18:07,785
. . .but it will still be Minsk.

274
00:18:07,991 --> 00:18:09,549
Happy New Year.

275
00:18:11,068 --> 00:18:12,387
Are you all right?

276
00:18:12,866 --> 00:18:14,663
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

277
00:18:23,255 --> 00:18:24,290
You're going to Minsk.

278
00:18:25,453 --> 00:18:27,364
No, I'm not going to Minsk.

279
00:18:27,571 --> 00:18:29,163
Oh, you are so going to Minsk.

280
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:32,287
You belong in Minsk.
You can't stay here just for me.

281
00:18:32,526 --> 00:18:35,598
Yes, I can. Because if I go,
it means I have to break up with you.

282
00:18:35,842 --> 00:18:38,959
-And I can't break up with you.
-Oh, yes. Yes, you can.

283
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:43,391
Just say, ''Phoebe, I love you,
but my work is my life.

284
00:18:43,634 --> 00:18:45,226
That's what I have to do now. ''

285
00:18:45,472 --> 00:18:48,225
And I say, ''Your work?
How can you say that?''

286
00:18:50,187 --> 00:18:52,382
And then you say,
''It's tearing me apart. . .

287
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:55,139
. . .but I have no choice.
Can't you understand that?''

288
00:18:55,382 --> 00:18:57,054
And I say, ''No!

289
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,939
No! I can't understand that! ''

290
00:19:00,137 --> 00:19:00,967
Sorry.

291
00:19:02,615 --> 00:19:05,175
And then you put
your arms around me. . . .

292
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:07,124
Put your arms around me.

293
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:08,485
Sorry.

294
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:13,077
And then you tell me you love me
and you'll never forget me.

295
00:19:14,123 --> 00:19:16,318
I'll never forget you.

296
00:19:17,719 --> 00:19:20,358
Then you say that it's almost
midnight and you have to go. . .

297
00:19:20,596 --> 00:19:24,987
. . .because you don't want to start
the year with me if you can't finish it.

298
00:19:31,185 --> 00:19:32,504
I'm gonna miss you. . .

299
00:19:32,943 --> 00:19:34,615
. . .you scientist guy.

300
00:19:36,979 --> 00:19:38,776
Hi, this is Dick Clark live
in Times Square.

301
00:19:39,017 --> 00:19:43,693
We're in a virtual snowstorm
of confetti here in Times Square.

302
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,570
It gets better every year.

303
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,163
Here you go, kids.

304
00:19:48,088 --> 00:19:50,682
And then the peacock bit me.

305
00:19:51,444 --> 00:19:53,196
Please kiss me at midnight!

306
00:19:58,157 --> 00:19:58,987
You seen Sandy?

307
00:19:59,236 --> 00:20:01,511
I don't know how to tell you this. . .

308
00:20:01,754 --> 00:20:05,542
. . .but she's in the bedroom getting it
on with Max, that scientist geek.

309
00:20:05,949 --> 00:20:08,258
Cool, look at that.
I did know how to tell you.

310
00:20:09,306 --> 00:20:11,661
Hey, everybody, the ball is going.

311
00:20:11,863 --> 00:20:12,852
What?

312
00:20:13,781 --> 00:20:15,612
The ball is dropping!

313
00:20:18,137 --> 00:20:20,412
In 20 seconds, it'll be midnight.

314
00:20:20,614 --> 00:20:23,253
And the moment of joy is upon us.

315
00:20:23,851 --> 00:20:26,649
Looks like that ''No-Date Pact'' thing
worked out.

316
00:20:27,048 --> 00:20:29,437
Everybody looks so happy.
I hate that!

317
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,840
Not everybody is happy.
Hey, Bobby!

318
00:20:32,042 --> 00:20:34,636
--four, three, two. . .

319
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:37,558
. . .one! Happy New Year!

320
00:20:39,475 --> 00:20:42,353
I just thought I'd throw this out.
I'm no math whiz. . .

321
00:20:42,591 --> 00:20:46,823
. . .but I do believe there are
three girls and three guys right here.

322
00:20:48,785 --> 00:20:51,458
I don't feel like kissing
anyone tonight.

323
00:20:51,702 --> 00:20:53,420
I can't kiss anyone.

324
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,338
So I'm kissing everyone?

325
00:20:56,058 --> 00:20:58,094
You can't kiss Ross.
That's your brother.

326
00:20:59,094 --> 00:21:01,733
Perfect. So now everybody's
getting kissed but me.

327
00:21:01,971 --> 00:21:03,199
Somebody kiss me.

328
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:07,039
Somebody kiss me! It's midnight!
Somebody kiss me! It's midnight!

329
00:21:07,286 --> 00:21:09,117
All right! All right! All right!

330
00:21:09,484 --> 00:21:10,473
There!

331
00:21:17,755 --> 00:21:20,223
I wanted this to work so much.

332
00:21:20,872 --> 00:21:22,510
I'm still in there, you know?

333
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,662
Changing his diapers.
Picking his fleas.

334
00:21:26,187 --> 00:21:28,382
But he's just phoning it in.

335
00:21:29,823 --> 00:21:32,291
It's hard to accept
that something you love so much. . .

336
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,656
. . .doesn't love you back, you know?

337
00:21:35,417 --> 00:21:38,375
I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
