The One With the Two Parts - Part II
Previously on Friends. . . .

2
00:00:03,019 --> 00:00:04,452
-Excuse me.
-It's Phoebe!

3
00:00:04,659 --> 00:00:06,650
-WiII that be aII?
-They're twins.

4
00:00:06,858 --> 00:00:09,247
Phoebe's Phoebe. Ursula's hot!

5
00:00:09,457 --> 00:00:10,253
It's for Ursula.

6
00:00:10,456 --> 00:00:13,016
Sure, yeah. Okay, it fits.

7
00:00:13,215 --> 00:00:14,887
Marcel, give Rossy the remote.

8
00:00:17,414 --> 00:00:18,688
How did he do this?

9
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:21,123
It's this whole stupid Ursula thing.

10
00:00:21,372 --> 00:00:24,409
So he's going out with her.
Is it really so terrible?

11
00:00:24,611 --> 00:00:26,761
-You don't know my sister.
-Talk to Joey.

12
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,689
-He's falling in love with her.
-You won't lose him.

13
00:00:29,889 --> 00:00:33,199
They haven't even slept together yet.
That's not serious.

14
00:00:37,406 --> 00:00:38,600
May we help you?

15
00:00:40,005 --> 00:00:41,438
Rachel! Rachel!

16
00:00:41,764 --> 00:00:43,800
I'm okay! I'm okay!

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,760
My friend was taking down
our Christmas lights. . .

19
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:57,076
. . .and she fell off the balcony
and may have broken her ankle.

20
00:00:57,278 --> 00:00:59,746
My God, you still have
your Christmas lights up?

21
00:01:02,076 --> 00:01:03,748
Fill this out and bring it back.

22
00:01:04,155 --> 00:01:05,304
Here you go.

23
00:01:10,672 --> 00:01:11,787
All right.

24
00:01:12,112 --> 00:01:13,431
Name. . .

25
00:01:13,671 --> 00:01:14,865
. . .address. . . .

26
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,147
In case of emergency, call. . .?

27
00:01:18,389 --> 00:01:19,504
You.

28
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:20,865
Really?

29
00:01:22,947 --> 00:01:24,539
Oh, that is so sweet!

30
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,622
Oh, gosh. I love you.

31
00:01:28,865 --> 00:01:30,298
Okay, insurance?

32
00:01:30,584 --> 00:01:33,382
Yeah, check it.
Definitely gonna want some of that!

33
00:01:34,703 --> 00:01:35,931
You don't have insurance?

34
00:01:36,182 --> 00:01:37,695
Why? How much will this cost?

35
00:01:37,941 --> 00:01:40,580
X-rays alone could be
a couple hundred dollars!

36
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,135
-What'll we do?
-There's not much we can do.

37
00:01:45,578 --> 00:01:47,694
Unless I use yours.

38
00:01:50,696 --> 00:01:51,845
Now wait a second.

39
00:01:52,056 --> 00:01:55,128
Who did I just put as my
''in case of emergency'' person?

40
00:01:55,534 --> 00:01:57,047
That's insurance fraud.

41
00:01:58,693 --> 00:02:01,844
All right then, forget it.
Might as well just go home.

42
00:02:04,811 --> 00:02:08,087
-Okay, come here. I hate this.
-Thank you. I love you.

43
00:02:10,328 --> 00:02:13,240
I'm gonna need
a new set of these forms.

44
00:02:13,927 --> 00:02:14,723
Why?

45
00:02:16,046 --> 00:02:18,082
I am really an idiot!

46
00:02:19,685 --> 00:02:21,516
I was filling out my friend's form. . .

47
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:23,794
. . .and instead of putting
her information. . .

48
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:25,237
. . .I put mine.

49
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,280
You are an idiot.

50
00:02:28,121 --> 00:02:31,272
Yep, that's me.
I am that stupid.

51
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:36,117
I had a dream that I was
playing football with my kid.

52
00:02:36,918 --> 00:02:38,112
That's nice.

53
00:02:38,477 --> 00:02:40,069
No, no. With him.

54
00:02:43,155 --> 00:02:46,147
I'm on this field,
and they hike me the baby.

55
00:02:47,794 --> 00:02:51,389
I've gotta do something because the
Tampa Bay team's coming right at me!

56
00:02:52,632 --> 00:02:54,668
Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.

57
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,869
Right, but. . .

58
00:02:58,069 --> 00:03:01,857
. . .it is just me and the baby,
so I'm thinking they can take us.

59
00:03:03,627 --> 00:03:05,140
And so, I. . .

60
00:03:05,746 --> 00:03:07,259
. . .I just heave it downfield!

61
00:03:07,506 --> 00:03:09,303
What are you, crazy?
That's a baby!

62
00:03:09,505 --> 00:03:11,655
He should take the sack?

63
00:03:15,103 --> 00:03:16,058
Anyway. . .

64
00:03:16,302 --> 00:03:18,372
. . .suddenly I'm downfield.

65
00:03:18,621 --> 00:03:22,296
And I realize that I'm the one
who's suppose to catch him, right?

66
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,134
Only I know I'm not gonna
get there in time.

67
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:27,091
So I am running and I'm running. . .

68
00:03:27,298 --> 00:03:28,890
. . .and that is when I woke up.

69
00:03:29,137 --> 00:03:32,368
See, I am so not ready
to be a father.

70
00:03:32,576 --> 00:03:34,407
Hey, you're gonna be fine.

71
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:37,846
You're one of the most caring,
responsible men in North America.

72
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,085
You're gonna make a great dad.

73
00:03:41,332 --> 00:03:44,768
Yeah, Ross. You and the baby
just need better blocking.

74
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:51,647
Have you ever been to the
Rainbow Room? Is it expensive?

75
00:03:51,888 --> 00:03:53,480
Only if you order stuff.

76
00:03:55,087 --> 00:03:57,681
I'm taking Ursula tonight.
It's her birthday.

77
00:03:57,886 --> 00:04:00,844
-What about Phoebe's birthday?
-When's that?

78
00:04:02,804 --> 00:04:03,600
Tonight.

79
00:04:04,443 --> 00:04:07,037
Man, what are the odds
of that happening?

80
00:04:09,121 --> 00:04:10,759
You take your time.

81
00:04:16,038 --> 00:04:17,153
There it is!

82
00:04:20,996 --> 00:04:21,906
What'll you do?

83
00:04:22,716 --> 00:04:26,425
What can I do? I don't want
to screw it up with Ursula.

84
00:04:26,674 --> 00:04:27,663
And your friend, Phoebe?

85
00:04:27,914 --> 00:04:31,623
If she's my friend, she'll understand.
Wouldn't you guys?

86
00:04:32,112 --> 00:04:33,864
If you tried that on my birthday. . .

87
00:04:34,111 --> 00:04:37,228
. . .you'd be staring at
the business end of a hissy fit.

88
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:42,621
An added pinch of saffron
makes all the difference.

89
00:04:47,826 --> 00:04:48,622
Monica?

90
00:04:48,865 --> 00:04:49,661
Yes?

91
00:04:50,105 --> 00:04:51,902
Yes, she is.

92
00:04:52,704 --> 00:04:54,535
This is my friend, Rachel.

93
00:04:54,743 --> 00:04:56,222
Hi, I'm Dr. Mitchell.

94
00:04:56,422 --> 00:04:58,811
And I'm his friend, Dr. Rosen.

95
00:04:59,701 --> 00:05:01,612
Aren't you a little cute
to be a doctor?

96
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,014
Excuse me?

97
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:05,056
God, young, young.
I meant young.

98
00:05:05,299 --> 00:05:07,051
Young to be a doctor.

99
00:05:07,258 --> 00:05:09,613
-Good, Rach.
-Thank you.

100
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:22,003
He said it was a sprain,
and that was it.

101
00:05:22,212 --> 00:05:24,407
You left out the stupid part.

102
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:26,046
It's not stupid.

103
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:30,442
The very cute doctors asked us out
for tomorrow night, and I said yes.

104
00:05:30,688 --> 00:05:33,805
I think it's totally insane.
They work for the hospital.

105
00:05:34,007 --> 00:05:36,805
It's like returning
to the scene of the crime.

106
00:05:37,406 --> 00:05:41,240
-I say we blow off the dates.
-What? Monica, they are cute.

107
00:05:41,484 --> 00:05:44,954
They are doctors. Cute doctors.
Doctors who are cute.

108
00:05:45,403 --> 00:05:47,792
All right, what have
we learned so far?

109
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:50,837
Oh, God.

110
00:05:56,678 --> 00:05:57,906
Surprise!

111
00:06:05,275 --> 00:06:07,994
What are you doing?
You scared the crap out of me!

112
00:06:09,673 --> 00:06:11,504
-Was that the cake?
-Yeah.

113
00:06:11,952 --> 00:06:13,988
I got a lemon schmush.

114
00:06:14,551 --> 00:06:16,587
Come on.
She'll be here any minute.

115
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,583
I hope it's okay.

116
00:06:22,748 --> 00:06:24,545
''Happy Birthday, Peehee. ''

117
00:06:26,466 --> 00:06:28,821
Maybe we can make
a ''B'' out of a rose.

118
00:06:29,025 --> 00:06:31,380
Yeah, we'll just use
our special cake tools.

119
00:06:32,464 --> 00:06:33,817
-What's going on?
-We just--

120
00:06:34,063 --> 00:06:35,576
Surprise!

121
00:06:38,901 --> 00:06:40,619
This is so great!

122
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,811
This was not at all scary.

123
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:45,658
Hi, everybody. Hi, Betty!

124
00:06:45,858 --> 00:06:47,052
Betty, hi!

125
00:06:47,258 --> 00:06:50,409
You found Betty!
Oh, my gosh! This is so great.

126
00:06:50,657 --> 00:06:53,888
Everybody I love is in the same room.

127
00:06:54,135 --> 00:06:55,727
Where's Joey?

128
00:06:58,453 --> 00:06:59,806
Did you see Betty?

129
00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:13,444
I wouldn't mind having a piece
of this sun-dried tomato business.

130
00:07:14,207 --> 00:07:18,405
Years ago, if somebody'd said, ''Here's
a tomato that looks like a prune'' . . .

131
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,880
. . .I'd have said,
''Get out of my office! ''

132
00:07:24,123 --> 00:07:26,842
Dad, before I was born,
did you freak out at all?

133
00:07:27,042 --> 00:07:29,351
I'm not freaking out!
I'm just saying. . .

134
00:07:29,601 --> 00:07:32,035
. . .if someone had come to me
with the idea--

135
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,198
I'm talking about
the whole baby thing.

136
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:38,152
Did you ever get this sort of. . .

137
00:07:38,397 --> 00:07:42,754
. . .panicky, ''Oh, my God, I'm gonna
be a father'' kind of a thing?

138
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:47,667
Your mother did the work.
I was busy with the business.

139
00:07:47,914 --> 00:07:49,666
I wasn't around that much.

140
00:07:49,913 --> 00:07:51,790
Is that what this is about?

141
00:07:51,992 --> 00:07:53,664
No, no. I was just wondering.

142
00:07:53,871 --> 00:07:57,181
There's time to make up for that.
We can do stuff together.

143
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:01,628
You always wanted to go to coIonial
Williamsburg. How about we do that?

144
00:08:02,228 --> 00:08:03,980
Thanks, Dad, really.

145
00:08:04,227 --> 00:08:06,741
You know, I just, I just. . . .

146
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:09,581
I just needed to know. . .

147
00:08:09,785 --> 00:08:12,743
. . .when did you start
to feel like a father?

148
00:08:14,183 --> 00:08:18,813
Well, I guess it must have been
the day after you were born.

149
00:08:19,421 --> 00:08:22,333
We were in the hospital room,
your mother was asleep. . .

150
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:26,209
. . .and they brought you in
and gave you to me.

151
00:08:26,418 --> 00:08:29,535
You were this ugly little red thing!

152
00:08:29,897 --> 00:08:33,936
And all of a sudden, you grabbed
my finger with your whole fist. . .

153
00:08:34,175 --> 00:08:35,654
. . .and you squeezed it. . .

154
00:08:35,895 --> 00:08:37,533
. . .so tight.

155
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,130
And that's when I knew.

156
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:46,889
So you don't want to go
to Williamsburg?

157
00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:51,920
We can go to Williamsburg.

158
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:54,721
Eat your fish.

159
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:01,035
Rachel, the cute doctors are here!

160
00:09:01,284 --> 00:09:02,637
Okay, coming.

161
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,393
Hi, come on in.
Hey, Michael, Jeffrey.

162
00:09:06,802 --> 00:09:07,678
We brought wine.

163
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:12,319
Look at this. It's from the cellars
of Ernest and Tova Borgnine.

164
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,636
-How could we resist?
-That's great!

165
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,315
-So, Monica, how's the ankle?
-It's. . . .

166
00:09:19,717 --> 00:09:21,514
Why don't you tell them?

167
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:23,588
After all, it is your ankle.

168
00:09:24,115 --> 00:09:26,913
It's feeling a lot better.
Thank you.

169
00:09:27,154 --> 00:09:30,703
Why don't you guys sit down,
and we'll get you some glasses.

170
00:09:32,392 --> 00:09:33,302
Stat!

171
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,141
Listen, why don't we just
tell them who we really are?

172
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:44,098
-I think it'll be fine.
-It will not. We'll get in trouble.

173
00:09:44,307 --> 00:09:46,138
Would you stop being such a wuss!

174
00:09:46,466 --> 00:09:50,015
A wuss? Excuse me
for living in the real world.

175
00:09:50,345 --> 00:09:52,540
-So?
-So they still seem normal.

176
00:09:52,784 --> 00:09:53,933
Because they are.

177
00:09:54,143 --> 00:09:56,532
When we go out with women
we meet at the hospital--

178
00:09:56,782 --> 00:09:58,977
Would you relax?
Take a look around.

179
00:09:59,581 --> 00:10:02,300
There are no pagan altars.

180
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,093
No piles of bones in the corners.

181
00:10:06,298 --> 00:10:08,368
They're fine. Go like this:

182
00:10:12,096 --> 00:10:15,975
We are not going to do it, okay?
Sometimes you can be such a big baby!

183
00:10:16,175 --> 00:10:17,733
-I am not a baby.
-Be serious.

184
00:10:17,934 --> 00:10:20,004
-You get uptight--
-You act like a princess.

185
00:10:20,213 --> 00:10:22,522
You know what? You know what?

186
00:10:22,732 --> 00:10:26,486
Every day you are becoming
more and more like your mother.

187
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,089
Excuse me.

188
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,479
Here we go.

189
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:33,397
This is a great place.
How long have you lived here?

190
00:10:33,608 --> 00:10:36,441
Thanks. I've been here
about six years.

191
00:10:36,646 --> 00:10:39,683
And Rachel moved in a few months ago.

192
00:10:40,645 --> 00:10:43,113
See, I was supposed to get married. . .

193
00:10:43,324 --> 00:10:45,280
. . .but I left the guy at the altar.

194
00:10:50,561 --> 00:10:53,155
Yeah, I know
it's pretty selfish, but. . .

195
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,675
. . .hey, that's me!

196
00:10:59,837 --> 00:11:01,475
Why don't you try the hummus?

197
00:11:01,716 --> 00:11:02,944
Monica, what do you do?

198
00:11:04,115 --> 00:11:06,310
I am a chef at a restaurant uptown.

199
00:11:06,514 --> 00:11:07,310
Good for you.

200
00:11:07,514 --> 00:11:08,867
Yeah, it is.

201
00:11:10,153 --> 00:11:14,863
Mostly because I get to boss people
around, which I just love to do.

202
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,822
Well, this hummus is great.

203
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:20,667
God bless the chickpea.

204
00:11:25,347 --> 00:11:26,496
Oh, God!

205
00:11:26,706 --> 00:11:29,061
I am so spoiled!

206
00:11:33,144 --> 00:11:34,133
That's it.

207
00:11:35,743 --> 00:11:38,257
And have I mentioned that
back in high school. . .

208
00:11:38,462 --> 00:11:39,781
. . .I was a cow?

209
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,056
I used to wet my bed.

210
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:47,618
I use my breasts to get
other people's attention.

211
00:11:47,938 --> 00:11:49,656
We both do that!

212
00:12:03,412 --> 00:12:06,051
Monica and Rachel's apartment.

213
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:10,084
Just one second.
Rachel, it's your dad.

214
00:12:12,928 --> 00:12:14,122
Hi, Dad.

215
00:12:14,327 --> 00:12:16,238
No, no. It's me.

216
00:12:17,246 --> 00:12:19,840
Listen, Dad,
I can't talk right now.

217
00:12:20,045 --> 00:12:22,036
But there's something. . . .

218
00:12:22,244 --> 00:12:24,963
There's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

219
00:12:25,643 --> 00:12:26,439
Excuse me.

220
00:12:26,842 --> 00:12:28,798
Remember back in freshman year?

221
00:12:29,001 --> 00:12:31,834
Well, Billy Dreskin and I
had sex on your bed.

222
00:12:42,236 --> 00:12:43,271
Daddy. . . .

223
00:12:44,315 --> 00:12:47,068
Why? Why would I sleep
with Billy Dreskin?

224
00:12:47,314 --> 00:12:49,464
His father tried to put
you out of business!

225
00:12:49,713 --> 00:12:51,112
You are dead!

226
00:12:55,071 --> 00:12:57,266
Ross, he's got the remote again.

227
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,625
Good.

228
00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:01,068
Maybe he can switch it back.

229
00:13:04,907 --> 00:13:06,056
Maybe not.

230
00:13:13,184 --> 00:13:16,460
Hold on a second and let me
just check and see if she's here.

231
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:20,416
It's the woman from the hospital.
There's a problem with the form.

232
00:13:20,621 --> 00:13:22,259
Oh, God, what do we do?

233
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,218
Just find out what they want.

234
00:13:24,459 --> 00:13:26,211
Okay. No, you do it.

235
00:13:26,898 --> 00:13:29,014
Hello. This is Monica.

236
00:13:33,056 --> 00:13:35,251
Yes, we'll be right down.
Thank you.

237
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:39,014
We forgot to sign one
of the admissions forms.

238
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:42,326
-You're right, this wasn't worth it.
-Thank you.

239
00:13:42,612 --> 00:13:44,204
Let me just change.

240
00:13:50,049 --> 00:13:51,084
Trouble?

241
00:13:52,288 --> 00:13:54,324
Your sister stood me up
the other night.

242
00:13:54,527 --> 00:13:57,997
Oh, no. Don't you hate it
when people aren't there for you?

243
00:13:59,885 --> 00:14:02,718
-Did you try calling her?
-I've been trying for two days.

244
00:14:02,964 --> 00:14:05,603
When I called the restaurant,
they said she was busy.

245
00:14:05,843 --> 00:14:08,403
I can't believe
she's blowing me off!

246
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:33,430
You got a minute?

247
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:36,391
Yeah, I'm just working.

248
00:14:48,026 --> 00:14:49,857
I got you a birthday present.

249
00:14:50,185 --> 00:14:51,584
Wow, you remembered!

250
00:14:57,262 --> 00:14:59,218
It's a Judy Jetson thermos.

251
00:14:59,421 --> 00:15:00,649
Like the kind you--

252
00:15:00,861 --> 00:15:01,976
Right.

253
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,690
Oh, I got something for you too.

254
00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:06,776
How'd you know I was coming?

255
00:15:07,378 --> 00:15:09,255
Yeah, twin thing.

256
00:15:11,657 --> 00:15:13,648
I can't believe you did this.

257
00:15:13,856 --> 00:15:15,574
I can't believe you. . .

258
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:17,373
. . .did this!

259
00:15:21,413 --> 00:15:23,529
So what's the deal
with you and Joey?

260
00:15:24,331 --> 00:15:25,605
Oh, right.

261
00:15:25,811 --> 00:15:28,484
He is so great.
But that's over.

262
00:15:29,409 --> 00:15:31,127
-Does he know?
-Who?

263
00:15:31,968 --> 00:15:36,405
Joey. You know, he's really nutsy
about you.

264
00:15:36,846 --> 00:15:38,279
He is? Why?

265
00:15:38,566 --> 00:15:39,555
You got me.

266
00:15:40,605 --> 00:15:41,594
Excuse me. . .

267
00:15:41,845 --> 00:15:44,359
. . .doesn't this come
with a side salad?

268
00:15:45,923 --> 00:15:47,675
So are you gonna call him?

269
00:15:47,882 --> 00:15:50,635
-You think he likes me?
-No. Joey.

270
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,555
No, no. He is so smart.
He'll figure it out.

271
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:57,357
Do you want some chicken?

272
00:15:58,118 --> 00:16:00,348
No, no.
No food with a face, remember?

273
00:16:01,237 --> 00:16:03,273
You have not changed.

274
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:04,949
Yeah, you too.

275
00:16:08,314 --> 00:16:09,793
Hi! Remember us?

276
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:15,182
You just called about needing
a signature on the admissions form?

277
00:16:15,431 --> 00:16:17,786
Well, it turns out
we need a whole new one.

278
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,986
Because, you see. . .

279
00:16:20,509 --> 00:16:22,545
. . .I put the wrong name again.

280
00:16:23,228 --> 00:16:25,947
-Because--
-You're that stupid!

281
00:16:27,146 --> 00:16:29,740
I am. I'm that stupid!

282
00:16:30,305 --> 00:16:32,694
And I'm just gonna pay
for this with a check.

283
00:16:33,104 --> 00:16:34,856
Your insurance will cover that.

284
00:16:35,063 --> 00:16:37,531
Yeah, I know.
I'm just not that bright either.

285
00:16:39,701 --> 00:16:41,100
Okay, worst case scenario:

286
00:16:41,421 --> 00:16:43,537
Say you never feel like a father.

287
00:16:44,739 --> 00:16:48,527
Say your son never feels
connected to you as one.

288
00:16:49,018 --> 00:16:52,488
Say all of his relationships
are affected by this.

289
00:16:52,696 --> 00:16:54,334
Do you have a point?

290
00:16:55,495 --> 00:16:57,326
You know, you'd think I would.

291
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,130
What's up with the simian?

292
00:17:03,172 --> 00:17:05,128
It's just a fur ball.

293
00:17:07,011 --> 00:17:08,490
Whose turn is it?

294
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,567
Yours. I got
43 points for ''kidney. ''

295
00:17:10,969 --> 00:17:14,166
No, you got
zero points for ''idney. ''

296
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:16,598
I had a ''K. ''
Where's my ''K''?

297
00:17:23,404 --> 00:17:26,202
You've got to help me!
My monkey swallowed a ''K'' !

298
00:17:26,403 --> 00:17:27,836
Get that animal out of here!

299
00:17:28,042 --> 00:17:31,352
The animal hospital is across town.
He's choking!

300
00:17:31,561 --> 00:17:34,121
-What is it?
-Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.

301
00:17:36,159 --> 00:17:36,955
Excuse me.

302
00:17:37,398 --> 00:17:39,628
This hospital is for people!

303
00:17:39,837 --> 00:17:42,112
He is people!
He has a name, okay?

304
00:17:42,316 --> 00:17:43,874
He watches Jeopardy!...

305
00:17:44,076 --> 00:17:46,715
. . .he touches himself
when nobody's watching.

306
00:17:47,754 --> 00:17:49,187
Please have a heart.

307
00:17:49,394 --> 00:17:51,544
-I'll take a look at him.
-Thank you.

308
00:17:51,793 --> 00:17:52,782
-Michael!
-Rachel.

309
00:17:52,992 --> 00:17:54,710
-What?
-Monica.

310
00:18:09,785 --> 00:18:10,900
Urs!

311
00:18:11,385 --> 00:18:13,296
I've been trying to call you.

312
00:18:14,464 --> 00:18:15,419
Listen. . . .

313
00:18:15,623 --> 00:18:19,298
Don't say ''listen. '' I know that
''listen. '' I've said that ''listen. ''

314
00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:21,497
I'm sorry.

315
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,411
I don't get it.
What happened?

316
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,969
What about what
you said under the bridge?

317
00:18:30,897 --> 00:18:33,411
Forget about what
I said under the bridge.

318
00:18:33,616 --> 00:18:36,688
I was talking crazy that night.
I was so drunk.

319
00:18:38,374 --> 00:18:39,284
You don't drink.

320
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:41,884
That's right, I don't.

321
00:18:42,452 --> 00:18:44,283
But I was drunk on you.

322
00:18:46,451 --> 00:18:48,089
But it's not gonna work.

323
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:51,330
Why? Is it because
I'm friends with Phoebe?

324
00:18:52,528 --> 00:18:55,201
If it was, would you
stop hanging out with her?

325
00:18:58,486 --> 00:19:00,158
No, I couldn't do that.

326
00:19:01,565 --> 00:19:03,476
Then, yeah, it's because of Phoebe.

327
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:07,482
So you know, it's either her or me.

328
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:11,874
Then I'm sorry.

329
00:19:17,998 --> 00:19:20,273
You're gonna be
really hard to get over.

330
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,066
I know.

331
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:32,266
I don't know whether it's just
because we're breaking up or what. . .

332
00:19:32,512 --> 00:19:34,423
. . .but you've never
looked so beautiful.

333
00:19:35,071 --> 00:19:36,060
Really?

334
00:20:05,659 --> 00:20:06,853
Pheebs?

335
00:20:17,295 --> 00:20:18,523
He looks so tiny.

336
00:20:20,133 --> 00:20:21,805
-We just got the message.
-Is he okay?

337
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:24,243
The doctor got the ''K'' out.

338
00:20:24,852 --> 00:20:27,082
He also found an ''M'' and an ''O. ''

339
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:31,649
We think he was trying
to spell out ''monkey. ''

340
00:20:37,726 --> 00:20:41,036
The doctor says he'll be fine.
He's just sleeping now.

341
00:20:42,644 --> 00:20:44,362
So you feel like a dad yet?

342
00:20:44,604 --> 00:20:46,276
No. Why?

343
00:20:46,643 --> 00:20:50,113
Come on, you came through.
You did what you had to do.

344
00:20:50,321 --> 00:20:52,039
That's very ''dad. ''

345
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,390
He's waking up.

346
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,075
Hey, fella.
How you doing?
