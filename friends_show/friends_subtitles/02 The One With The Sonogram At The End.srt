1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,199
You guys don't understand.

2
00:00:02,439 --> 00:00:05,237
For us, kissing is as
important as any part of it.

3
00:00:05,437 --> 00:00:06,870
Yeah, right!

4
00:00:09,474 --> 00:00:10,543
You serious?

5
00:00:11,593 --> 00:00:12,503
Oh, yeah!

6
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:14,987
All you need to know
is in the first kiss.

7
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:16,026
Absolutely.

8
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,664
For us, kissing's an opening act. . .

9
00:00:18,868 --> 00:00:21,860
. . .like the comedian
you have to sit through. . .

10
00:00:22,066 --> 00:00:23,977
. . .before Pink Floyd comes out.

11
00:00:27,142 --> 00:00:30,214
And it's not that
we don't like the comedian.

12
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,615
It's just that that's not. . .

13
00:00:32,818 --> 00:00:34,729
. . .why we bought the ticket.

14
00:00:37,055 --> 00:00:41,173
The problem is, after the concert,
no matter how great the show was. . .

15
00:00:41,412 --> 00:00:44,768
. . .you girls are always looking
for the comedian again.

16
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:47,968
We're in the car, fighting traffic. . .

17
00:00:48,168 --> 00:00:49,647
. . .just trying to stay awake.

18
00:00:51,606 --> 00:00:54,359
Well, word of advice:
Bring back the comedian.

19
00:00:54,604 --> 00:00:59,041
Or next time you'll find yourself
listening to that album alone.

20
00:01:03,637 --> 00:01:05,946
Are we still talking about sex?

21
00:01:07,675 --> 00:01:09,347
The One With the Sonogram at the End

22
00:01:12,352 --> 00:01:13,341
English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

23
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,631
No, it's good.
It is good.

24
00:02:00,839 --> 00:02:04,354
It's just that doesn't she seem
a little angry?

25
00:02:04,556 --> 00:02:06,148
Well, she has issues.

26
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,113
Does she?

27
00:02:09,473 --> 00:02:11,703
He's out banging other women
with a club. . .

28
00:02:11,911 --> 00:02:15,426
. . .while she's home getting
the mastodon smell out of the carpet.

29
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:18,581
Marsha, see, these are cave people.

30
00:02:19,586 --> 00:02:21,702
Okay, they have issues like:

31
00:02:22,104 --> 00:02:25,540
''Gee, that glacier's
getting kind of close! '' See?

32
00:02:25,742 --> 00:02:28,302
Speaking of issues,
isn't that your ex-wife?

33
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,693
Yes, it is. Carol, hi!

34
00:02:30,938 --> 00:02:32,530
Okay. Yes, it is.

35
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:34,972
I'll catch up with you
in the Ice Age.

36
00:02:49,246 --> 00:02:50,679
Hi.

37
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,636
So. . . .

38
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,478
You look great.

39
00:03:02,677 --> 00:03:03,712
I hate that.

40
00:03:04,675 --> 00:03:05,505
Sorry.

41
00:03:05,755 --> 00:03:07,825
Thanks. You look good too.

42
00:03:08,073 --> 00:03:10,462
Well, you know,
in here, anyone who. . .

43
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,544
. . .stands erect. . . .

44
00:03:16,827 --> 00:03:18,180
So what's new?
Still a--

45
00:03:18,386 --> 00:03:19,535
A lesbian?

46
00:03:21,384 --> 00:03:22,453
You never know.

47
00:03:23,023 --> 00:03:24,934
How's the family?

48
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:28,140
Marty's still totally paranoid.

49
00:03:28,339 --> 00:03:30,057
Carol, why are you here?

50
00:03:31,937 --> 00:03:32,733
I'm pregnant.

51
00:03:33,096 --> 00:03:34,051
Pregnant!

52
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,079
She didn 't leave
in such a hurry after all.

53
00:03:45,448 --> 00:03:49,839
This is the Three's Company episode
where's there's a misunderstanding.

54
00:03:52,643 --> 00:03:54,634
Then I've already seen this one.

55
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,032
Are you through with that?

56
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,787
Sorry, the swallowing
slowed me down.

57
00:04:02,237 --> 00:04:03,955
Whose ball of paper is this?

58
00:04:04,195 --> 00:04:07,790
That's mine. I wrote a note to
myself, then I didn't need it.

59
00:04:07,993 --> 00:04:10,029
So I balled it up
and now I wish I was dead.

60
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:17,186
She already fluffed that pillow.
You already fluffed-- It's fine.

61
00:04:17,786 --> 00:04:21,142
I don't want to give them
any more ammunition than they have.

62
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,335
We know how cruel parents can be. . .

63
00:04:23,582 --> 00:04:26,301
. . .about the flatness
of a child's pillow.

64
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,092
Monica? Hi!

65
00:04:29,778 --> 00:04:32,087
Monica, you're scaring me.

66
00:04:33,415 --> 00:04:36,646
I mean, you're all chaotic
and twirly, you know?

67
00:04:37,053 --> 00:04:38,168
Not in a good way.

68
00:04:40,011 --> 00:04:41,046
Yeah, calm down.

69
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:45,602
You don't see Ross getting chaotic
and twirly every time they come.

70
00:04:45,807 --> 00:04:49,402
That's because my parents think
Ross can do no wrong.

71
00:04:49,644 --> 00:04:51,441
You see, he's ''The Prince. ''

72
00:04:51,683 --> 00:04:54,993
Apparently they had some big ceremony
before I was born.

73
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:00,946
-What?
-Ugly Naked Guy got a ThighMaster.

74
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:08,512
-Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
-Yeah, it's beautiful!

75
00:05:13,868 --> 00:05:15,301
Oh, God! Oh, God!

76
00:05:16,946 --> 00:05:18,777
No, don't touch that.

77
00:05:21,143 --> 00:05:25,216
Like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough
having to return it to him.

78
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,371
''Barry, remember me?
I'm the girl. . .

79
00:05:27,579 --> 00:05:30,377
. . .that stomped on your heart
in front of your family''

80
00:05:30,617 --> 00:05:33,609
Now I must return the ring,
without the ring. . .

81
00:05:33,854 --> 00:05:36,652
. . .which makes it so much harder.

82
00:05:37,572 --> 00:05:39,449
Easy, we'll find it.
Won't we?

83
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,280
Okay, look.

84
00:05:43,848 --> 00:05:45,281
When did you have it last?

85
00:05:45,487 --> 00:05:47,717
Doy! Probably
right before she lost it.

86
00:05:50,004 --> 00:05:52,564
You don't get
a lot of ''doy'' these days.

87
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:56,681
I know I had it this morning.

88
00:05:56,919 --> 00:05:59,797
I know I had it when I was
in the kitchen with. . . .

89
00:06:00,037 --> 00:06:01,356
Dinah?

90
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:06,753
Oh, don't be mad.

91
00:06:07,152 --> 00:06:09,347
-You didn't!
-Oh, I'm sorry.

92
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,740
I gave you one job!

93
00:06:13,028 --> 00:06:15,542
But look how straight
those noodles are.

94
00:06:16,785 --> 00:06:20,744
That's not how you look
for an engagement ring in a lasagna.

95
00:06:23,021 --> 00:06:24,500
I just can't do it.

96
00:06:25,739 --> 00:06:26,728
Boys?

97
00:06:27,818 --> 00:06:29,137
We're going in!

98
00:06:37,411 --> 00:06:38,207
Hi.

99
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,728
That is not a happy ''hi. ''

100
00:06:41,928 --> 00:06:43,361
Carol's pregnant.

101
00:06:43,567 --> 00:06:44,920
I found it!

102
00:06:50,523 --> 00:06:51,717
Yeah.

103
00:06:52,721 --> 00:06:54,313
Do that for two hours. . .

104
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,114
. . .you might be where I am
right about now.

105
00:06:58,077 --> 00:07:01,149
That puts that whole
pillow thing in perspective.

106
00:07:03,394 --> 00:07:05,749
How do you fit
into this whole thing?

107
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:08,506
Carol says she and Susan
want me to be involved.

108
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:13,147
But if I'm not comfortable with it,
I don't have to be involved.

109
00:07:13,387 --> 00:07:15,264
Basically, it's totally up to me.

110
00:07:15,466 --> 00:07:17,536
She is so great.
I miss her.

111
00:07:22,581 --> 00:07:23,934
What does she mean by ''involved''?

112
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,574
Presumably, the biggest
part of your job is done.

113
00:07:28,737 --> 00:07:31,205
Anyway, they want me
to go down to this. . .

114
00:07:31,415 --> 00:07:33,770
. . .sonogram thing
with them tomorrow.

115
00:07:33,973 --> 00:07:34,962
What'll you do?

116
00:07:35,172 --> 00:07:37,128
I have no idea.

117
00:07:37,371 --> 00:07:40,886
No matter what I do, though,
I'm still gonna be a father.

118
00:07:50,482 --> 00:07:52,040
This is still ruined, right?

119
00:07:58,317 --> 00:08:01,468
Martha Lugwin's daughter
is going to call you.

120
00:08:04,153 --> 00:08:05,871
What's that curry taste?

121
00:08:06,351 --> 00:08:07,466
Curry.

122
00:08:11,748 --> 00:08:14,706
I think they're great.
I really do.

123
00:08:14,945 --> 00:08:17,857
Remember the Lugwins?
The big one had a thing for you.

124
00:08:18,063 --> 00:08:19,701
They all had a thing for him!

125
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:21,452
Oh, Mom!

126
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,771
Why is this girl going to call me?

127
00:08:24,019 --> 00:08:28,251
She just graduated, and she wants
to be something in cooking, food. . .

128
00:08:28,496 --> 00:08:29,645
. . .or I don't know.

129
00:08:29,855 --> 00:08:31,493
I told her you had a restaurant.

130
00:08:31,734 --> 00:08:34,806
I don't have a restaurant.
I work in a restaurant.

131
00:08:35,052 --> 00:08:36,770
They don't have to know that.

132
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:42,918
Ross, help me with the spaghetti.

133
00:08:44,246 --> 00:08:46,282
Oh, we're having spaghetti.
That's. . .

134
00:08:46,524 --> 00:08:47,843
. . .easy.

135
00:08:49,882 --> 00:08:52,840
This'll sound unbelievably selfish
on my part. . .

136
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,032
. . .but did you plan on bringing
up the baby/lesbian thing?

137
00:08:56,237 --> 00:08:57,989
It'd take the heat off of me.

138
00:09:01,914 --> 00:09:05,623
What Rachel did to her life!
We ran into her parents at the club.

139
00:09:05,831 --> 00:09:07,662
They were not playing very well.

140
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,026
I won't say what they
spent on that wedding. . .

141
00:09:10,268 --> 00:09:12,657
. . .but $40,000 is a lot of money.

142
00:09:15,504 --> 00:09:19,019
At least she had the chance
to leave a man at the altar.

143
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,254
What's that supposed to mean?

144
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:24,608
Nothing.

145
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:28,056
-It's an expression.
-No, it's not.

146
00:09:28,296 --> 00:09:31,493
Don't listen to her!
You've always been independent.

147
00:09:31,773 --> 00:09:34,003
Even when you were a kid,
and you were chubby. . .

148
00:09:34,212 --> 00:09:37,204
. . .and you had no friends,
you were just fine.

149
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:41,641
You'd read alone in your room.
And your puzzles. . . .

150
00:09:45,044 --> 00:09:48,832
There are people, like Ross,
who need to shoot for the stars.

151
00:09:49,042 --> 00:09:51,761
With his museum and
his papers getting published.

152
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,996
Others are satisfied as they are.

153
00:09:54,198 --> 00:09:57,793
I'm telling you, these are
the people who never get cancer.

154
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:04,593
I read about women trying
to have it all, and I thank God. . .

155
00:10:04,831 --> 00:10:07,664
. . .our little Harmonica
doesn't have that problem.

156
00:10:10,267 --> 00:10:12,861
So, Ross, what's going on with you?

157
00:10:13,865 --> 00:10:18,461
Any stories? No news, no little
anecdotes to share with the folks?

158
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:25,050
Look, I realize you guys
have been wondering. . .

159
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:28,215
. . .what exactly happened
between Carol and me.

160
00:10:28,415 --> 00:10:30,053
So here's the deal.

161
00:10:33,052 --> 00:10:34,451
Carol's a lesbian.

162
00:10:36,609 --> 00:10:38,804
She's living with a woman named Susan.

163
00:10:40,647 --> 00:10:43,161
She's pregnant with my child.

164
00:10:44,124 --> 00:10:47,002
And she and Susan are
going to raise the baby.

165
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,473
And you knew about this?

166
00:11:06,989 --> 00:11:08,661
Your folks are really that bad?

167
00:11:09,747 --> 00:11:12,181
Well, you know, these people are pros.

168
00:11:14,384 --> 00:11:16,773
They know what they do.
They take their time.

169
00:11:17,022 --> 00:11:19,582
They get the job done!

170
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:24,371
Boy, I know they say that
you can't change your parents.

171
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:27,529
Boy, if you could, I'd want yours.

172
00:11:29,414 --> 00:11:30,210
Must pee!

173
00:11:32,012 --> 00:11:33,684
It's worse when you're twins.

174
00:11:33,891 --> 00:11:35,927
-You're a twin?
-Yeah. We don't speak.

175
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:38,848
She's this high-powered,
driven, career-type.

176
00:11:39,167 --> 00:11:40,919
-What does she do?
-She's a waitress.

177
00:11:43,084 --> 00:11:45,917
All right. You guys,
I kind of gotta clean up now.

178
00:11:46,162 --> 00:11:48,915
Chandler, you're an only child.
You don't have any of this.

179
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,357
No, although I did have
an imaginary friend. . .

180
00:11:52,598 --> 00:11:54,270
. . .who my parents preferred.

181
00:11:56,475 --> 00:11:58,511
Hit the lights, please.

182
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,423
How long was I in there?

183
00:12:08,147 --> 00:12:09,262
I'm just cleaning up.

184
00:12:09,986 --> 00:12:12,500
Do you need any help?

185
00:12:14,143 --> 00:12:15,462
Okay, sure. Thanks.

186
00:12:21,099 --> 00:12:22,088
Anyway. . . .

187
00:12:23,137 --> 00:12:26,174
So you nervous
about Barry tomorrow?

188
00:12:26,695 --> 00:12:28,014
A little.

189
00:12:29,773 --> 00:12:31,092
A lot.

190
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,680
So, got any advice?

191
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:37,881
You know, as someone
who's recently been dumped.

192
00:12:39,087 --> 00:12:42,397
Well, you may want to steer clear
of the word ''dumped. ''

193
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:47,802
Chances are he's going to be this
broken shell of a man. You know?

194
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,874
You should try not to look too terrific.
I know it'll be hard.

195
00:12:55,236 --> 00:12:59,388
You know, I'll go down there,
and I'll give Barry back his ring.

196
00:12:59,633 --> 00:13:04,070
And you can go with Carol
and Susan to the OB-G YN.

197
00:13:05,948 --> 00:13:08,303
You've got Carol tomorrow.

198
00:13:09,106 --> 00:13:10,983
When did it get so complicated?

199
00:13:11,225 --> 00:13:12,419
Got me.

200
00:13:13,263 --> 00:13:15,652
Remember when we were
in high school together?

201
00:13:15,902 --> 00:13:18,257
Didn't you think you'd meet someone. . .

202
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,809
. . .fall in love, and that'd be it?

203
00:13:30,412 --> 00:13:32,607
Man! I never thought I'd be here.

204
00:13:40,165 --> 00:13:41,280
Me neither.

205
00:13:58,273 --> 00:14:00,264
Sorry I'm late.
I got stuck at work.

206
00:14:00,511 --> 00:14:03,947
There was this big
dinosaur thing. Anyway. . . .

207
00:14:04,908 --> 00:14:05,704
Hi.

208
00:14:07,027 --> 00:14:09,985
-You remember Susan.
-How could I forget?

209
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:13,852
Hello, Susan.
Good shake, good shake.

210
00:14:15,901 --> 00:14:18,495
So we're just waiting for. . .?

211
00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:20,929
-Dr. Oberman.
-And is he--?

212
00:14:21,137 --> 00:14:23,014
-She.
-Of course, ''she. ''

213
00:14:24,695 --> 00:14:28,574
Is she familiar with our
special situation?

214
00:14:28,772 --> 00:14:30,524
Yes, and she's very supportive.

215
00:14:30,731 --> 00:14:32,687
Great! Okay, that's great!

216
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:35,398
No, I'm. . . .

217
00:14:36,687 --> 00:14:37,597
Thanks.

218
00:14:57,393 --> 00:14:58,951
That opens my cervix.

219
00:15:05,148 --> 00:15:05,944
Barry?

220
00:15:06,147 --> 00:15:07,375
Come on in.

221
00:15:08,226 --> 00:15:09,056
Are you sure?

222
00:15:09,665 --> 00:15:12,338
It's fine, it's fine.
Robbie's gonna be here for hours.

223
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,618
So how are you doing?

224
00:15:18,738 --> 00:15:19,568
I'm. . . .

225
00:15:20,977 --> 00:15:22,376
I'm okay.

226
00:15:23,575 --> 00:15:24,690
You look great.

227
00:15:26,813 --> 00:15:29,202
Dr. Farber, Jason
Greenspan 's gagging.

228
00:15:29,451 --> 00:15:32,170
Be right there.
I'll be back in a second.

229
00:15:37,046 --> 00:15:37,842
I dumped him.

230
00:15:56,433 --> 00:15:59,186
So how's this going to work. . .

231
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,190
. . .you know, with us?

232
00:16:01,429 --> 00:16:04,227
You know, when important
decisions have to be made?

233
00:16:04,587 --> 00:16:05,861
Give me a ''for instance. ''

234
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:07,738
Well, I don't know.

235
00:16:07,945 --> 00:16:11,255
-How about with the baby's name?
-Marlon. . .

236
00:16:11,463 --> 00:16:13,931
. . .if it's a boy.
Minnie, if it's a girl.

237
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,339
As in ''Mouse''?

238
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,297
As in my grandmother.

239
00:16:21,136 --> 00:16:24,048
Still, you say ''Minnie,''
you hear ''Mouse. ''

240
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:27,611
How about. . . .

241
00:16:28,211 --> 00:16:29,564
How about ''Julia''?

242
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:31,399
Julia.

243
00:16:31,609 --> 00:16:32,724
We agreed on Minnie.

244
00:16:33,008 --> 00:16:35,568
We agreed we'd spend
our lives together.

245
00:16:35,806 --> 00:16:38,320
Things change.
Roll with the punches.

246
00:16:39,004 --> 00:16:40,835
I believe Julia's on the table.

247
00:16:43,801 --> 00:16:45,120
Sorry about that.

248
00:16:48,198 --> 00:16:50,553
So what have you been up to?

249
00:16:51,955 --> 00:16:53,149
Not much.

250
00:16:53,754 --> 00:16:54,743
I got a job.

251
00:16:54,953 --> 00:16:56,102
That's great!

252
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:58,745
Why are you so tan?

253
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:02,378
I went to Aruba.

254
00:17:03,587 --> 00:17:06,306
Oh, no!
You went on our honeymoon alone?

255
00:17:06,545 --> 00:17:07,694
No.

256
00:17:11,062 --> 00:17:12,700
See, I went with. . . .

257
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,738
-Now, this may hurt.
-Me?

258
00:17:19,776 --> 00:17:20,845
I went with Mindy.

259
00:17:21,655 --> 00:17:22,690
Mindy?

260
00:17:23,774 --> 00:17:25,002
My maid of honor?

261
00:17:27,131 --> 00:17:28,883
We're kind of a thing now.

262
00:17:32,488 --> 00:17:34,160
You got plugs!

263
00:17:34,446 --> 00:17:37,165
Careful, careful. They
haven't quite taken yet.

264
00:17:37,764 --> 00:17:39,322
And you got lenses.

265
00:17:40,243 --> 00:17:42,882
But you hate sticking
your finger in your eye.

266
00:17:43,121 --> 00:17:44,474
Not for her.

267
00:17:48,357 --> 00:17:50,587
Listen, I really
wanted to thank you.

268
00:17:53,474 --> 00:17:55,385
A month ago,
I wanted to hurt you. . .

269
00:17:55,752 --> 00:17:58,061
. . .more than I've ever
wanted to hurt anyone.

270
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,584
And I'm an orthodontist.

271
00:18:02,028 --> 00:18:03,381
You know, you were right.

272
00:18:03,627 --> 00:18:05,265
I thought we were happy.

273
00:18:05,665 --> 00:18:06,620
We weren't.

274
00:18:08,224 --> 00:18:10,101
But with Mindy. . .

275
00:18:10,822 --> 00:18:12,460
. . .now I'm happy.

276
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,889
-Spit.
-What?

277
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:15,975
Me.

278
00:18:18,457 --> 00:18:19,856
Anyway. . . .

279
00:18:21,695 --> 00:18:24,892
I guess this belongs to you.

280
00:18:26,052 --> 00:18:28,247
And thank you for giving it to me.

281
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:31,285
Well, thank you for giving it back.

282
00:18:34,686 --> 00:18:36,039
Hello!

283
00:18:39,482 --> 00:18:41,473
Oh, please!
What's wrong with Helen?

284
00:18:41,681 --> 00:18:42,716
Helen Geller?

285
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,108
l don't think so!

286
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:47,349
It's not gonna be Helen Geller.

287
00:18:47,557 --> 00:18:48,626
Thank you.

288
00:18:48,876 --> 00:18:50,707
No. I mean, it's not Geller.

289
00:18:51,514 --> 00:18:52,913
It'll be Helen Willick?

290
00:18:53,993 --> 00:18:58,066
Actually, we talked about
Helen Willick Bunch.

291
00:18:59,709 --> 00:19:02,269
Well, wait a minute.
Why is she in the title?

292
00:19:02,467 --> 00:19:03,786
It's my baby too.

293
00:19:04,506 --> 00:19:07,100
Really? I don't remember
you making any sperm.

294
00:19:09,702 --> 00:19:12,216
And we all know what
a challenge that is.

295
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,333
You two, stop it!

296
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:16,615
She gets a credit!
I'm in there too!

297
00:19:17,617 --> 00:19:22,327
Not Helen Willick Bunch Geller.
I think that borders on child abuse.

298
00:19:22,533 --> 00:19:26,162
Of course not!
I'm suggesting Geller Willick Bunch.

299
00:19:26,411 --> 00:19:29,289
He knows no one will
say all those names.

300
00:19:29,489 --> 00:19:32,845
They'll end up calling her Geller.
Then he gets his way.

301
00:19:33,486 --> 00:19:35,397
My way?
You think this is my way?

302
00:19:35,644 --> 00:19:39,114
Of all the ways I ever imagined
this moment in my life being. . .

303
00:19:39,362 --> 00:19:42,832
. . .this is not my way. You know what?
This is too hard.

304
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:45,639
Knock, knock!
How are we today? Any nausea?

305
00:19:45,838 --> 00:19:47,669
-A little.
-Just a little.

306
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:53,985
I was just wondering about the
mother-to-be, but thanks for sharing.

307
00:19:54,232 --> 00:19:55,028
Lie back.

308
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,509
You know what? I'm gonna go.

309
00:19:57,749 --> 00:20:01,583
I don't think I can be involved
in this particular family thing.

310
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,534
Oh, my God!

311
00:20:13,739 --> 00:20:14,967
Look at that!

312
00:20:15,178 --> 00:20:16,531
I know!

313
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,761
Well, isn't that amazing?

314
00:20:32,326 --> 00:20:33,964
What are we supposed to see?

315
00:20:35,724 --> 00:20:39,353
I don't know, but I think it's about
to attack the Enterprise.

316
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:46,152
If you tilt your head
to the left and relax your eyes. . .

317
00:20:46,357 --> 00:20:48,552
. . .it kind of looks
like an old potato.

318
00:20:49,754 --> 00:20:51,346
Then don't do that, all right?

319
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:56,783
What do you think?

320
00:20:59,428 --> 00:21:00,827
Are you welling up?

321
00:21:01,626 --> 00:21:02,422
You are.

322
00:21:02,665 --> 00:21:04,735
-You are. You're welling up.
-I'm not.

323
00:21:04,984 --> 00:21:07,623
-You're going to be an aunt.
-Oh, shut up!

324
00:21:08,981 --> 00:21:10,539
Hi, Mindy!

325
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,537
Hi, it's Rachel.

326
00:21:12,819 --> 00:21:16,528
Yeah, I'm fine.
I saw Barry today.

327
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:21,250
He told me. No, it's okay.
Really, it's okay.

328
00:21:21,493 --> 00:21:24,849
I hope you two are very happy.
I really do.

329
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:28,560
And, Min, you know,
if everything works out. . .

330
00:21:28,768 --> 00:21:32,317
. . .and you guys end up getting
married and having kids. . .

331
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:35,483
. . .I hope they have his old
hairline and your old nose!

332
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,995
I know it was a cheap shot,
but I feel so much better now!
