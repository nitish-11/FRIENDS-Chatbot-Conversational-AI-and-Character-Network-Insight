1
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,750
Oh, look, look!
There's Joey's picture!

2
00:00:06,959 --> 00:00:08,233
This is so exciting!

3
00:00:08,438 --> 00:00:11,236
You can spot someone who's
never seen his plays.

4
00:00:11,477 --> 00:00:13,866
Notice, no fear.
No sense of impending doom.

5
00:00:14,076 --> 00:00:16,192
The exclamation point scares me.

6
00:00:16,435 --> 00:00:18,585
It's not just Freud,
it's Freud!

7
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:21,591
Magic is about to happen!

8
00:00:22,672 --> 00:00:24,105
Well, Eva. . .

9
00:00:24,871 --> 00:00:27,829
. . .we've done
some excellent work here.

10
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,708
And I would have to say. . .

11
00:00:31,229 --> 00:00:34,824
. . .your problem is quite clear.

12
00:00:36,586 --> 00:00:39,658
All you want is a dinkle

13
00:00:40,025 --> 00:00:42,778
What you envy's a schwang

14
00:00:42,984 --> 00:00:46,181
A thing through which you can tinkle

15
00:00:46,382 --> 00:00:48,942
To play with or simply let hang

16
00:00:49,141 --> 00:00:51,257
The One With the Butt

17
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,529

18
00:01:44,917 --> 00:01:46,953
I feel violated.

19
00:01:47,716 --> 00:01:50,708
Did anybody else feel like
peeling their skin off. . .

20
00:01:50,915 --> 00:01:52,746
. . .to have something else to do?

21
00:01:53,394 --> 00:01:54,383
Ross, 1 0:00.

22
00:01:54,633 --> 00:01:56,351
Is it? It feels like 2.

23
00:01:57,632 --> 00:01:59,350
No, 1 0:00!

24
00:02:01,231 --> 00:02:04,940
There's a beautiful woman
at 8, 9, 1 0:00!

25
00:02:07,028 --> 00:02:08,143
Hello!

26
00:02:08,387 --> 00:02:09,183
She's amazing!

27
00:02:09,427 --> 00:02:13,022
She makes the women I dream about
look like short, fat, bald men.

28
00:02:14,185 --> 00:02:15,823
Go over to her.
She's not with anyone.

29
00:02:16,024 --> 00:02:17,776
And what would my opening line be?

30
00:02:18,023 --> 00:02:19,342
Excuse me. . . .

31
00:02:21,822 --> 00:02:24,052
Come on, she's a person.
You can do it.

32
00:02:24,261 --> 00:02:27,139
Could she be more out of my league?
Ross, back me up.

33
00:02:27,339 --> 00:02:30,137
He could never get a woman
like that in a million years.

34
00:02:32,137 --> 00:02:35,766
But you always see these beautiful
women with these ''nothing'' guys.

35
00:02:36,016 --> 00:02:37,927
You could be one of those guys.

36
00:02:38,895 --> 00:02:40,647
-You could do that.
-You think?

37
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:41,724
Absolutely!

38
00:02:41,933 --> 00:02:44,447
I can't believe
I'm even considering this.

39
00:02:44,692 --> 00:02:47,160
-I'm very aware of my tongue.
-Come on.

40
00:02:47,411 --> 00:02:48,560
Here goes.

41
00:02:57,127 --> 00:02:59,038
Okay, next word would be. . .

42
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:00,235
. . .Chandler.

43
00:03:01,365 --> 00:03:03,925
Chandler is my name and. . . .

44
00:03:04,444 --> 00:03:05,240
Hi!

45
00:03:07,402 --> 00:03:08,755
Yes, you said that.

46
00:03:09,002 --> 00:03:11,835
Yes! Yes, I did.
But what I didn't say. . .

47
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,031
. . .what I wanted to say was. . .

48
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,312
. . .would you like to go out with me?
Thank you. Good night.

49
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,107
Chandler?

50
00:03:21,596 --> 00:03:22,392
There he is!

51
00:03:22,596 --> 00:03:24,985
-I didn't know you could dance!
-You were in a play!

52
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:27,314
What'd you think?

53
00:03:28,194 --> 00:03:31,186
-I didn't know you could dance!
-You were in a play!

54
00:03:31,392 --> 00:03:33,952
Come on, it wasn't that bad.
I was the lead.

55
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:37,268
It was better than the troll thing.
At least you got to see my head.

56
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:40,465
-You're right.
-We saw your head.

57
00:03:40,668 --> 00:03:42,147
She said yes! She said yes!

58
00:03:43,547 --> 00:03:45,105
Awful play, man!

59
00:03:47,665 --> 00:03:51,738
Her name's Aurora. She's Italian
and she pronounces my name ''Chandler. ''

60
00:03:53,743 --> 00:03:56,735
I like that better.
The usher gave me this to give to you.

61
00:03:56,941 --> 00:03:59,899
-What is it?
-The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency.

62
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,819
An agency left me its card.
Maybe they wanna sign me!

63
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:04,134
Based on this play?

64
00:04:06,657 --> 00:04:08,568
Based on this play!

65
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,288
Hey, kids!

66
00:04:19,572 --> 00:04:22,848
No, because this line is passion,
and this is just a line.

67
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:26,719
I've been here seven seconds, and you
haven't asked me how my date went.

68
00:04:27,728 --> 00:04:30,242
How was your date, Chandler?

69
00:04:30,447 --> 00:04:31,641
It was unbelievable!

70
00:04:31,847 --> 00:04:35,442
I've never met anyone like her.
She's had the most amazing life!

71
00:04:35,645 --> 00:04:36,919
She was in the Israeli army.

72
00:04:37,164 --> 00:04:39,314
None of the bullets hit
the engine block. . .

73
00:04:39,563 --> 00:04:41,838
. . .so we made it to the border.

74
00:04:42,042 --> 00:04:43,873
But just barely and I. . . .

75
00:04:44,921 --> 00:04:48,675
I've been talking about myself
all night long. I'm sorry.

76
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:50,870
What about you?
Tell me your stories.

77
00:04:51,718 --> 00:04:52,867
All right, once. . .

78
00:04:53,118 --> 00:04:55,712
. . .once I got on the subway, right?

79
00:04:55,956 --> 00:04:57,514
And it was at night. . .

80
00:04:57,756 --> 00:05:00,270
. . .and I rode it
all the way to Brooklyn. . .

81
00:05:01,154 --> 00:05:02,872
. . .just for the hell of it.

82
00:05:03,673 --> 00:05:06,141
We talked till 2.
It was this perfect evening.

83
00:05:07,352 --> 00:05:08,228
More or less.

84
00:05:08,431 --> 00:05:10,706
Suddenly, we realized
we were in Yemen.

85
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,623
I'm sorry, so ''we'' is. . .?

86
00:05:13,469 --> 00:05:14,663
''We'' is me and Rick.

87
00:05:14,908 --> 00:05:15,784
Who's Rick?

88
00:05:16,028 --> 00:05:17,222
Who's Rick?

89
00:05:18,467 --> 00:05:19,377
My husband.

90
00:05:21,745 --> 00:05:24,020
-Oh, so you're divorced?
-No.

91
00:05:24,944 --> 00:05:28,061
I'm sorry. So you're widowed?
Hopefully?

92
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:30,615
No, I'm still married.

93
00:05:32,341 --> 00:05:36,459
So how would your husband feel
about you sitting here with me. . .

94
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:39,009
. . .sliding your foot
so far up my leg. . .

95
00:05:39,218 --> 00:05:41,652
. . .you can count
the change in my pocket?

96
00:05:43,296 --> 00:05:44,490
Don't worry.

97
00:05:44,696 --> 00:05:47,574
I imagine he'd be okay with you
because he's okay with Ethan.

98
00:05:49,054 --> 00:05:51,363
Ethan? There's an Ethan?

99
00:05:52,532 --> 00:05:54,329
Ethan is my. . .

100
00:05:54,931 --> 00:05:55,727
. . .boyfriend.

101
00:05:56,051 --> 00:05:57,086
What?!

102
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,883
What kind of relationship
do you imagine us having. . .

103
00:06:02,088 --> 00:06:04,556
. . .if you already have
a husband and a boyfriend?

104
00:06:05,447 --> 00:06:07,836
I suppose, mainly sexual.

105
00:06:11,324 --> 00:06:12,882
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

106
00:06:13,244 --> 00:06:16,236
What not work out?
I'm seeing her again on Thursday.

107
00:06:16,602 --> 00:06:18,035
Didn't you listen to the story?

108
00:06:20,281 --> 00:06:22,033
Didn't you listen to the story?

109
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,834
How could you get involved
with a woman like this?

110
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:28,355
I had trouble with it at first.
But I get all the good stuff.

111
00:06:28,557 --> 00:06:31,833
All the fun, all the talking,
all the sex. . .

112
00:06:32,036 --> 00:06:33,628
. . .and no responsibility.

113
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:36,912
This is every guy's fantasy!

114
00:06:37,114 --> 00:06:39,548
That is not true.
Ross, is this your fantasy?

115
00:06:39,792 --> 00:06:41,430
No, of course not.

116
00:06:43,631 --> 00:06:45,383
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

117
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:49,625
You'd go out with someone else
who's going out with someone else?

118
00:06:50,108 --> 00:06:50,904
I couldn't.

119
00:06:51,108 --> 00:06:52,097
Good for you.

120
00:06:52,387 --> 00:06:54,457
When I'm with a woman,
I need to know. . .

121
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:57,419
. . .that I'm going out
with more people than she is.

122
00:06:58,105 --> 00:06:58,935
You know. . .

123
00:06:59,144 --> 00:07:02,022
. . .monogamy can be a tricky concept.

124
00:07:02,223 --> 00:07:04,612
I mean, anthropologically speaking. . . .

125
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,212
Fine. Now you'll never know.

126
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,973
We're kidding. Tell us.

127
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,659
-We wanna know.
-Come on!

128
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:15,574
All right. There's a theory
put forth by Richard Leakey--

129
00:07:26,373 --> 00:07:29,285
Are we greeting each other
this way now? I like that.

130
00:07:30,891 --> 00:07:32,483
Look! I cleaned!

131
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,840
I did the windows.
I did the floors.

132
00:07:35,049 --> 00:07:38,246
I used all the attachments on
the vacuum except for that round one.

133
00:07:38,448 --> 00:07:39,801
I don't know what it's for.

134
00:07:40,047 --> 00:07:42,117
Nobody knows, and we're
not supposed to ask.

135
00:07:43,285 --> 00:07:44,434
What do you think?

136
00:07:44,685 --> 00:07:47,279
-It's very clean.
-Really, it looks great!

137
00:07:51,682 --> 00:07:54,071
I see you moved the green ottoman.

138
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,272
How did that happen?

139
00:08:00,678 --> 00:08:03,033
I don't know.
I thought it looked better there.

140
00:08:03,277 --> 00:08:06,428
And also, it's an extra seat
around the coffee table.

141
00:08:07,035 --> 00:08:08,866
Yeah, it's interesting.

142
00:08:10,354 --> 00:08:12,390
But you know what? Just for fun. . .

143
00:08:12,873 --> 00:08:16,183
. . .let's see what it looked like
in the old spot.

144
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,589
Just to compare.

145
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,018
Let's see.

146
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,227
Well, it looks good there too.

147
00:08:22,749 --> 00:08:24,705
Let's leave it there for a while.

148
00:08:25,667 --> 00:08:28,386
I can't believe you tried
to move the green ottoman.

149
00:08:29,466 --> 00:08:31,582
Thank God you didn't
fan out the magazines.

150
00:08:31,785 --> 00:08:33,582
She'll scratch your eyes out.

151
00:08:33,824 --> 00:08:35,576
You guys, I am not that bad!

152
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:36,977
Yeah, you are.

153
00:08:38,342 --> 00:08:39,775
Remember, I lived with you?

154
00:08:40,021 --> 00:08:41,773
You were a little, you know. . . .

155
00:08:45,619 --> 00:08:46,847
That is so unfair!

156
00:08:47,058 --> 00:08:50,733
When we were kids, yours was the only
Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy.

157
00:08:53,456 --> 00:08:55,970
Okay, so I'm responsible.
I'm organized.

158
00:08:56,175 --> 00:08:57,927
But, hey, I can be a kook!

159
00:09:00,213 --> 00:09:02,204
All right, you madcap gal!

160
00:09:03,891 --> 00:09:05,006
Try to imagine this.

161
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:08,760
The phone bill arrives,
but you don't pay it right away.

162
00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:09,805
Why not?

163
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:11,488
Because you're a kook!

164
00:09:13,527 --> 00:09:16,166
lnstead, you wait until
they send you a notice.

165
00:09:17,046 --> 00:09:18,195
I could do that.

166
00:09:18,405 --> 00:09:22,193
Okay, then you let me
go grocery shopping. . .

167
00:09:22,403 --> 00:09:24,121
. . .and I buy laundry detergent.

168
00:09:24,443 --> 00:09:27,640
But it's not the one
with the easy-pour spout.

169
00:09:27,841 --> 00:09:29,399
Why would someone do that?

170
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,556
One might wonder.

171
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,399
A glass is on the table.
There's no coaster.

172
00:09:36,637 --> 00:09:38,355
It's a cold drink. It's a hot day.

173
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:43,154
Beads of condensation are inching
their way closer to the wood. . . .

174
00:09:43,395 --> 00:09:44,384
Stop it!

175
00:09:47,953 --> 00:09:49,181
Oh, my God!

176
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:51,463
It's true. Who am I?

177
00:09:51,951 --> 00:09:53,907
Monica, you're Mom.

178
00:10:01,947 --> 00:10:02,936
Oh, my God!

179
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:07,143
Okay, I'll be there.

180
00:10:09,423 --> 00:10:10,936
That was my agent.

181
00:10:12,822 --> 00:10:17,373
My agent has just gotten me a job
in the new Al Pacino movie!

182
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,059
That's great!

183
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:21,375
What's the part?

184
00:10:21,578 --> 00:10:23,534
Can you believe this?
Al Pacino!

185
00:10:23,777 --> 00:10:25,529
This guy's why I became an actor.

186
00:10:25,737 --> 00:10:27,967
''I'm out of order?
You're out of order!

187
00:10:28,216 --> 00:10:30,935
This whole courtroom's out of order! ''

188
00:10:31,934 --> 00:10:33,526
Seriously, what's the part?

189
00:10:33,773 --> 00:10:37,288
''Just when I thought I was out,
they pull me back in! ''

190
00:10:37,612 --> 00:10:40,524
Come on. Seriously,
Joey, what's the part?

191
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:43,923
You're, you're. . . .
What?

192
00:10:46,408 --> 00:10:48,683
I'm his butt double, okay?

193
00:10:52,925 --> 00:10:55,359
I play Al Pacino's butt.

194
00:10:57,523 --> 00:11:00,640
All right? He goes
into the shower, and then. . .

195
00:11:00,882 --> 00:11:02,315
. . .I'm his butt.

196
00:11:03,161 --> 00:11:04,310
Oh, my God!

197
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,715
Come on, you guys.

198
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,111
This is a real movie
and Al Pacino's in it and that's big!

199
00:11:09,358 --> 00:11:10,711
Oh, no, it's terrific.

200
00:11:10,917 --> 00:11:13,033
After all your years of struggling. . .

201
00:11:13,236 --> 00:11:16,308
. . .you've finally been able
to crack your way into show business.

202
00:11:19,354 --> 00:11:21,629
Okay, fine.
Make jokes, I don't care.

203
00:11:21,873 --> 00:11:23,226
This is a big break for me!

204
00:11:23,472 --> 00:11:25,030
You're right. It is.

205
00:11:26,191 --> 00:11:28,910
So are you gonna invite us all
to the big opening?

206
00:11:41,145 --> 00:11:43,739
-I need to borrow some moisturizer.
-For what?

207
00:11:43,943 --> 00:11:45,854
What do you think?
Today's the big day!

208
00:11:46,382 --> 00:11:49,101
Okay, go into the bathroom.
Use whatever you want.

209
00:11:49,301 --> 00:11:51,895
Just don't ever tell me
what you did in there.

210
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,335
Thank you.

211
00:11:56,178 --> 00:11:58,169
-Joey's mom's on the phone.
-He's in the bathroom.

212
00:11:58,377 --> 00:12:01,687
-You don't wanna go in there!
-Come on, we're roommates.

213
00:12:03,335 --> 00:12:05,724
My eyes! My eyes!

214
00:12:08,173 --> 00:12:09,606
I warned you.

215
00:12:09,852 --> 00:12:11,570
Who is being loud?

216
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,683
Oh, that would be Monica.

217
00:12:14,211 --> 00:12:16,884
Can I borrow some things?
I wanna make Aurora breakfast.

218
00:12:17,129 --> 00:12:18,801
You got the whole night, huh?

219
00:12:19,049 --> 00:12:22,200
Well, I only have 20 minutes
until Ethan, so. . . .

220
00:12:22,447 --> 00:12:24,278
Do I sense a bit of resentment?

221
00:12:24,526 --> 00:12:27,484
No, no, no. No resentment.
Believe me. . .

222
00:12:27,725 --> 00:12:29,716
. . .it's worth it, okay?

223
00:12:29,924 --> 00:12:32,040
In a relationship,
you have these key moments. . .

224
00:12:32,243 --> 00:12:34,598
. . .you'll remember
for the rest of your life.

225
00:12:34,842 --> 00:12:37,914
Well, every single second
is like that with Aurora.

226
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,549
And I've just wasted
35 of them talking to you.

227
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,876
So, Monica, can you
help me with the door?

228
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:47,426
You know, the old Monica
would remind you. . .

229
00:12:47,636 --> 00:12:51,265
. . .to scrub that Teflon pan
with a plastic brush.

230
00:12:52,634 --> 00:12:54,465
But I'm not gonna do that.

231
00:13:00,111 --> 00:13:02,261
Damn it! Hire the girl.

232
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,499
Okay, everybody ready?

233
00:13:05,229 --> 00:13:08,744
Listen, I just wanna thank you
for this great opportunity.

234
00:13:09,947 --> 00:13:10,936
Lose the robe.

235
00:13:12,186 --> 00:13:12,982
Me?

236
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:14,420
That would work.

237
00:13:14,905 --> 00:13:17,658
Right. Okay.
Losing the robe!

238
00:13:19,103 --> 00:13:20,980
Okay, and the robe is lost.

239
00:13:21,742 --> 00:13:24,415
Everybody, I would like
to get this in one take.

240
00:13:24,621 --> 00:13:25,895
Let's roll it.

241
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,453
Water's working.

242
00:13:28,219 --> 00:13:29,937
And action!

243
00:13:31,938 --> 00:13:33,291
And cut!

244
00:13:34,097 --> 00:13:35,496
Butt guy, what are you doing?

245
00:13:36,936 --> 00:13:38,085
I'm showering.

246
00:13:38,615 --> 00:13:40,014
No, that was clenching.

247
00:13:40,814 --> 00:13:44,443
Well, the way I see it,
the guy's upset here, you know?

248
00:13:44,692 --> 00:13:46,842
His wife's dead,
his brother's missing.

249
00:13:47,051 --> 00:13:49,645
I think his butt would be angry here.

250
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,169
I think his butt would like
to get the shot before lunch.

251
00:13:54,088 --> 00:13:56,841
Once again, rolling.
Water working.

252
00:13:57,807 --> 00:13:59,638
And action!

253
00:14:00,925 --> 00:14:02,244
And cut!

254
00:14:02,485 --> 00:14:03,281
What was that?

255
00:14:04,524 --> 00:14:06,799
I was going for quiet desperation.

256
00:14:08,122 --> 00:14:10,841
But if you have to ask. . . .

257
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:19,030
God, I love these fingers.

258
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:20,393
Thank you.

259
00:14:20,597 --> 00:14:23,031
No, actually, I meant my fingers.

260
00:14:24,076 --> 00:14:26,431
Look at them.
Look at how happy they are.

261
00:14:28,394 --> 00:14:31,272
-Oh, my God, I'm late!
-Oh, no, no, no.

262
00:14:31,512 --> 00:14:34,310
-Don't go, don't go.
-Okay, okay.

263
00:14:35,231 --> 00:14:37,108
-I have to.
-Look, she's leaving.

264
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:40,264
I'm sorry.
He'll be waiting for me.

265
00:14:40,469 --> 00:14:42,027
I thought you talked to Rick.

266
00:14:42,268 --> 00:14:44,065
It's not Rick.

267
00:14:44,267 --> 00:14:46,303
Ethan? He gets
the whole day with you!

268
00:14:46,706 --> 00:14:48,139
No, it's Andrew.

269
00:14:53,503 --> 00:14:55,414
I know there'll be many moments. . .

270
00:14:55,622 --> 00:14:58,819
. . .when I'll regret asking
the following question, but. . . .

271
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,973
And Andrew is. . .?

272
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,056
He's. . .

273
00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:03,214
. . .new.

274
00:15:04,378 --> 00:15:08,496
So you're not completely fulfilled
by Rick, Ethan and myself?

275
00:15:08,697 --> 00:15:11,052
No, that's not exactly what I was--

276
00:15:11,256 --> 00:15:13,008
Most women would kill. . .

277
00:15:13,255 --> 00:15:15,211
. . .for three guys like us.

278
00:15:16,613 --> 00:15:17,841
So what do you want?

279
00:15:18,732 --> 00:15:19,528
You.

280
00:15:19,812 --> 00:15:22,451
-You have me.
-No, no. Just you.

281
00:15:23,011 --> 00:15:23,807
What do you mean?

282
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,802
Lose the other guys.

283
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:29,407
Like, all of them?

284
00:15:30,088 --> 00:15:32,921
Come on, we're great together.
Why not?

285
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:35,197
Why can't we just have
what we have now?

286
00:15:35,405 --> 00:15:37,635
Why can't we just talk,
laugh and make love. . .

287
00:15:37,884 --> 00:15:40,557
. . .without feeling obligated
to one another?

288
00:15:40,963 --> 00:15:44,399
Up until tonight, I thought
that's what you wanted too.

289
00:15:45,561 --> 00:15:47,392
Well, part of me wants that. . .

290
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,716
. . .but it's like I'm two guys.

291
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:52,792
I mean, one guy's saying,
''Shut up! This is great! ''

292
00:15:53,877 --> 00:15:55,549
But there's this other guy.

293
00:15:55,757 --> 00:15:58,635
It's the guy who wells up
every time the Grinch's heart. . .

294
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,594
. . .grows three sizes
and breaks that measuring device.

295
00:16:02,234 --> 00:16:06,193
He's saying, you know,
''This is too hard. Get out, get out! ''

296
00:16:07,072 --> 00:16:09,745
So which one of the two guys
will you listen to?

297
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:14,340
I have to listen to both.
They don't let each other finish.

298
00:16:16,068 --> 00:16:16,944
Which one?

299
00:16:20,826 --> 00:16:21,702
The second guy.

300
00:16:23,465 --> 00:16:24,454
I see.

301
00:16:29,142 --> 00:16:31,178
Call me if you change your mind.

302
00:16:39,578 --> 00:16:42,570
Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.

303
00:16:54,892 --> 00:16:57,645
Look at it this way.
You dumped her!

304
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:01,120
Right? I mean, this woman was. . .

305
00:17:01,329 --> 00:17:02,887
. . .unbelievably sexy. . .

306
00:17:03,128 --> 00:17:06,325
. . .and beautiful,
intelligent, unattainable. . . .

307
00:17:08,446 --> 00:17:10,357
Tell me why you did this again?

308
00:17:12,684 --> 00:17:14,037
Movie star!

309
00:17:14,243 --> 00:17:17,758
Aren't you the guy who plays
the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?

310
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:20,837
Nope.

311
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,549
No? What happened, big guy?

312
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:25,152
Big guy?

313
00:17:27,238 --> 00:17:29,354
It felt like a ''big guy'' moment.

314
00:17:30,357 --> 00:17:31,267
I got fired!

315
00:17:32,476 --> 00:17:34,307
They said I acted too much with it.

316
00:17:37,034 --> 00:17:38,786
I told everybody about this.

317
00:17:38,993 --> 00:17:40,870
Everybody will be
expecting to see me.

318
00:17:41,112 --> 00:17:43,546
You know what?
No one will be able to tell.

319
00:17:43,831 --> 00:17:45,344
My mom will.

320
00:17:47,189 --> 00:17:49,180
There's something so sweet. . .

321
00:17:49,428 --> 00:17:51,544
. . .and disturbing about that.

322
00:17:52,787 --> 00:17:55,585
I've done nothing
but crappy plays for six years. . .

323
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:58,704
. . .and I finally get my shot,
and I blow it!

324
00:17:58,904 --> 00:18:00,576
Maybe this wasn't your shot.

325
00:18:00,784 --> 00:18:05,141
I think when it's your shot,
you know it's your shot.

326
00:18:05,782 --> 00:18:08,137
Did it feel like your shot?

327
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,968
Hard to tell. I was naked.

328
00:18:12,219 --> 00:18:13,732
I don't think this was your shot.

329
00:18:13,938 --> 00:18:16,133
I don't even think
you just get one shot.

330
00:18:16,337 --> 00:18:19,568
I really believe big things are
gonna happen for you. I do.

331
00:18:19,816 --> 00:18:23,525
You've gotta keep thinking about
the day that some kid will go. . .

332
00:18:23,734 --> 00:18:27,249
. . . ''I got the part! I'm gonna be
Joey Tribbiani's ass! ''

333
00:18:30,411 --> 00:18:32,925
You think? That's so nice.

334
00:18:39,007 --> 00:18:41,475
I'm sorry, Joey.
I'm gonna go to bed, guys.

335
00:18:41,726 --> 00:18:42,715
Good night.

336
00:18:43,086 --> 00:18:45,202
You're gonna leave
your shoes out here?

337
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:53,314
Really? Just casually
strewn about. . .

338
00:18:53,521 --> 00:18:55,716
. . .in that reckless,
haphazard manner?

339
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,109
It doesn't matter.
I'll get them tomorrow. Or not!

340
00:19:02,757 --> 00:19:03,906
Whenever.

341
00:19:06,476 --> 00:19:09,115
She is a kook.

342
00:19:22,589 --> 00:19:26,502
If it bothers you that much,
just go out and get the shoes.

343
00:19:28,027 --> 00:19:30,495
No, don 't do this!

344
00:19:30,745 --> 00:19:32,098
This is stupid!

345
00:19:32,345 --> 00:19:35,303
I don 't have to prove anything.
I'm gonna go get them.

346
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,735
But then everyone will know.

347
00:19:39,182 --> 00:19:43,300
Unless I get them, and then wake up
really early and put them back.

348
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,173
I need help!
