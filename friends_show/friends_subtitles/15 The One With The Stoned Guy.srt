1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,055
Coffee.

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:05,535
-Thank you.
-Cappuccino.

3
00:00:06,818 --> 00:00:09,696
And a nice hot cider for Monica.

4
00:00:09,937 --> 00:00:11,006
Thank you.

5
00:00:11,736 --> 00:00:12,612
Rach?

6
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:15,530
Why does my cinnamon stick
have an eraser?

7
00:00:19,533 --> 00:00:20,852
That's why.

8
00:00:21,852 --> 00:00:23,205
Sorry.

9
00:00:25,571 --> 00:00:27,641
The One With the Stoned Guy

10
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:29,919
English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

11
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:21,338
Chandler?

12
00:01:22,429 --> 00:01:24,659
Miss Tedlock, you're looking
lovely today.

13
00:01:24,908 --> 00:01:28,298
May I say that is a very
flattering sleeve length on you?

14
00:01:30,186 --> 00:01:34,179
Mr. Costilick would like you to stop
by his office at the end of the day.

15
00:01:34,904 --> 00:01:38,453
If this is about those prank memos,
I had nothing to do with them.

16
00:01:38,703 --> 00:01:40,500
Nothing at all. Really.

17
00:01:41,022 --> 00:01:41,818
Nothing.

18
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,933
Hey, you guys! You guys!

19
00:01:47,179 --> 00:01:49,852
Chandler's coming and he says
he has incredible news.

20
00:01:50,098 --> 00:01:53,408
So when he gets here,
let's all act, like, you know--

21
00:01:54,097 --> 00:01:56,816
Never mind. But it was gonna
be really good.

22
00:01:57,695 --> 00:01:59,048
What's going on?

23
00:01:59,295 --> 00:02:01,855
So it's a typical day at work.
I'm inputting my numbers. . .

24
00:02:02,094 --> 00:02:06,804
. . .and Big Al tells me he wants
to make me processing supervisor.

25
00:02:07,052 --> 00:02:09,043
-That is great!
-Congratulations!

26
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:10,326
So. . .

27
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:11,406
. . .I quit.

28
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,209
Why?

29
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:15,445
Why? This was supposed to be
a temp job.

30
00:02:15,688 --> 00:02:18,407
Chandler, you've been there
for five years.

31
00:02:18,647 --> 00:02:22,640
I know, but if I took it, it would
be admitting that this is what I do.

32
00:02:22,886 --> 00:02:24,035
Was it a lot more money?

33
00:02:24,285 --> 00:02:28,198
Doesn't matter. I just don't want
to be a guy who sits in his office. . .

34
00:02:28,404 --> 00:02:29,996
. . .worrying about the WENUS.

35
00:02:33,442 --> 00:02:34,636
''The WENUS?''

36
00:02:35,001 --> 00:02:38,516
Weekly estimated net usage system.
It's a processing term.

37
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:41,036
Oh, that WENUS.

38
00:02:42,558 --> 00:02:43,593
What are you gonna do?

39
00:02:43,798 --> 00:02:45,834
I don't know. That's the thing.

40
00:02:46,037 --> 00:02:48,073
But I won't figure it out
working there.

41
00:02:48,316 --> 00:02:50,432
I have something you can do!

42
00:02:50,675 --> 00:02:52,745
I have this new massage client, Steve.

43
00:02:54,433 --> 00:02:56,993
Anyway, he's opening up
a restaurant. . .

44
00:02:57,232 --> 00:02:59,587
. . .and he's looking for a head chef.

45
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,299
Hi, there.

46
00:03:05,149 --> 00:03:08,505
I know. You're a chef, I know,
and I thought of you first.

47
00:03:08,748 --> 00:03:11,581
But Chandler's the one
who needs a job right now, so. . . .

48
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:16,339
I just don't have a lot
of chefing experience.

49
00:03:16,745 --> 00:03:18,497
Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.

50
00:03:20,663 --> 00:03:22,460
What kind of food
is he looking for?

51
00:03:22,663 --> 00:03:25,382
He wants to do something eclectic,
so he's looking for someone. . .

52
00:03:25,621 --> 00:03:27,577
. . .who can create the entire menu.

53
00:03:27,781 --> 00:03:29,373
-Oh, my God!
-Yeah, I know!

54
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,258
So what do you think?

55
00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:35,896
Thanks. I just don't see myself
in a big white hat.

56
00:03:39,056 --> 00:03:40,489
Oh, Monica! Guess what?

57
00:03:50,572 --> 00:03:52,528
Can you see my nipples
through this shirt?

58
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,162
No, but don't worry.
I'm sure they're still there.

59
00:03:59,608 --> 00:04:00,961
Where you going, Mr. Suit-ey Man?

60
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:05,759
I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert
Pilman, career counselor-a-go-go!

61
00:04:07,605 --> 00:04:09,118
I added the ''a-go-go. ''

62
00:04:09,604 --> 00:04:10,593
Career counselor?

63
00:04:10,844 --> 00:04:13,597
Hey, you guys all know
what you want to do.

64
00:04:13,843 --> 00:04:15,071
I don't.

65
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:19,158
Hey, you guys in the living room
all know what you want to do.

66
00:04:19,441 --> 00:04:21,557
You know, you have goals,
you have dreams.

67
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,949
I don't have a dream!

68
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,350
The lesser known
''I Don't Have a Dream'' speech.

69
00:04:28,157 --> 00:04:30,671
Oh, I love my life! I love my life!

70
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,349
Brian 's Song!

71
00:04:35,315 --> 00:04:36,543
The meeting went great?

72
00:04:36,794 --> 00:04:39,467
So great! He showed me
where the restaurant's gonna be.

73
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:41,590
It's this cute little place on 1 0th.

74
00:04:41,832 --> 00:04:44,505
It's not too big, not too small.
It's just right.

75
00:04:44,711 --> 00:04:47,942
Was it formerly owned
by a blond woman and some bears?

76
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:52,065
Anyway, I'm cooking for him
Monday night. Kind of an audition.

77
00:04:52,308 --> 00:04:55,186
He wants you to be here,
which will be great for me.

78
00:04:55,427 --> 00:04:56,701
You can make yummy noises.

79
00:04:57,026 --> 00:04:59,017
-What are you gonna make?
-Yummy noises.

80
00:05:01,185 --> 00:05:03,176
And, Monica, what are you gonna make?

81
00:05:03,424 --> 00:05:05,779
I don't know.
It's just got to be great.

82
00:05:06,023 --> 00:05:08,173
I know what you can make!
I know!

83
00:05:08,422 --> 00:05:11,095
You should make that thing
with the stuff.

84
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,656
You know. . .

85
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,891
. . .that thing with the stuff?

86
00:05:17,578 --> 00:05:18,772
Okay, I don't know.

87
00:05:20,617 --> 00:05:22,926
Anyone know a good date place
in the neighborhood?

88
00:05:23,736 --> 00:05:27,888
How about Tony's? If you can finish
a 32-ounce steak, it's free.

89
00:05:31,493 --> 00:05:34,724
Anyone know a good place
if you're not dating a puma?

90
00:05:36,091 --> 00:05:39,322
-Who are you going out with?
-Is this the bug lady?

91
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,607
I love you, Ross.

92
00:05:43,528 --> 00:05:45,246
Her name's Celia.
She's not a bug lady.

93
00:05:45,488 --> 00:05:47,763
She's curator of insects
at the museum.

94
00:05:49,326 --> 00:05:50,475
What are you gonna do?

95
00:05:50,885 --> 00:05:54,116
I thought we'd go to dinner,
then bring her back to my place. . .

96
00:05:54,324 --> 00:05:56,713
. . .and I'd introduce her to my monkey.

97
00:05:59,122 --> 00:06:00,919
He's not speaking metaphorically.

98
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,754
So back to your place?
You thinking maybe. . . .

99
00:06:10,598 --> 00:06:12,350
Well, I don't know. . . .

100
00:06:13,477 --> 00:06:14,671
I'm hoping. . . .

101
00:06:16,396 --> 00:06:18,512
I tell you, that monkey's
a chick magnet.

102
00:06:18,715 --> 00:06:23,027
She's gonna look at his furry, cute
little face and it'll seal the deal.

103
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:27,712
Celia, don't worry.
He's not gonna hurt you!

104
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:29,703
Soothing tones, soothing tones.

105
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,462
Here, here.
You want some?

106
00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:35,508
I can't stand this.

107
00:06:35,748 --> 00:06:37,306
He's got his claws on my--

108
00:06:37,507 --> 00:06:38,860
Yeah, all right.

109
00:06:47,064 --> 00:06:49,100
Try this salmon mousse.

110
00:06:50,902 --> 00:06:51,698
Good.

111
00:06:51,902 --> 00:06:54,291
Is it better than
the other salmon mousse?

112
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:56,096
It's creamier.

113
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,656
Yeah? Well, is that better?

114
00:06:58,859 --> 00:07:02,169
I don't know.
We're talking about whipped fish.

115
00:07:02,978 --> 00:07:05,367
I'm just happy I'm keeping it down.

116
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,647
God, what happened to you?

117
00:07:12,854 --> 00:07:15,687
Eight and a half hours
of aptitude tests. . .

118
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:20,011
. . .intelligence tests, personality
tests, and what do I learn?

119
00:07:20,651 --> 00:07:25,202
''You're suited for data processing for
a large multi national corporation. ''

120
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:29,680
That's so great because you
already know how to do that!

121
00:07:30,287 --> 00:07:32,005
Can you believe it?

122
00:07:32,206 --> 00:07:35,482
Don't I seem like I should
be doing something really cool?

123
00:07:35,725 --> 00:07:39,513
You know, I just always
pictured myself doing something. . . .

124
00:07:39,763 --> 00:07:40,912
Something!

125
00:07:41,163 --> 00:07:44,075
Oh, Chandler, I know, I know.

126
00:07:44,642 --> 00:07:47,634
You can see your nipples
through this shirt.

127
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,829
Here you go.
Maybe this will cheer you up.

128
00:07:54,758 --> 00:07:58,876
I had a grape about five hours ago,
so I better split this with you.

129
00:08:00,196 --> 00:08:02,869
It's supposed to be that small.
It's a pre-appetizer.

130
00:08:03,074 --> 00:08:05,872
The French call it an amuse-bouche.

131
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,903
Well, it is amusing.

132
00:08:18,908 --> 00:08:19,977
Oh, hi, Wendy.

133
00:08:20,548 --> 00:08:21,776
Yeah, 8:00.

134
00:08:22,747 --> 00:08:24,146
What did we say, $ 1 0 an hour?

135
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:26,661
Okay, great.

136
00:08:26,945 --> 00:08:28,901
All right, I'll see you then. Bye.

137
00:08:29,104 --> 00:08:30,537
Ten dollars an hour for what?

138
00:08:30,784 --> 00:08:33,173
I asked a waitress at work
to help me out.

139
00:08:33,743 --> 00:08:34,892
Waitressing?

140
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,213
Of course I thought of you.

141
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,255
But. . . .

142
00:08:42,699 --> 00:08:43,575
But. . . .

143
00:08:43,819 --> 00:08:44,615
But, but. . . .

144
00:08:46,338 --> 00:08:50,889
But, you see, it's just this thing
has to go just perfect, you know. . .

145
00:08:51,136 --> 00:08:54,970
. . .and, well, Wendy's more
of a professional waitress.

146
00:08:57,334 --> 00:09:01,885
And I'm maintaining my amateur status
so I can waitress in the Olympics.

147
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:09,801
You know, I don't mean to brag, but
I waited tables at lnnsbruck in '7 6.

148
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,286
Amuse-bouche?

149
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,473
Talk to me.

150
00:09:37,998 --> 00:09:40,831
A weird thing happened to me
on the train this morning--

151
00:09:41,397 --> 00:09:43,149
Talk dirty.

152
00:09:47,114 --> 00:09:49,753
-Here?
-Come on.

153
00:09:49,993 --> 00:09:51,028
Come on.

154
00:09:51,233 --> 00:09:52,712
Say something. . .

155
00:09:53,072 --> 00:09:54,471
. . .hot!

156
00:09:55,871 --> 00:09:56,986
What?

157
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,619
What?

158
00:10:00,189 --> 00:10:01,258
What?

159
00:10:02,588 --> 00:10:03,577
What?

160
00:10:03,988 --> 00:10:05,421
-What?
-Vulva.

161
00:10:12,704 --> 00:10:13,853
''Vulva?''

162
00:10:15,903 --> 00:10:18,019
All right, I panicked, all right?

163
00:10:18,262 --> 00:10:19,934
She took me by surprise.

164
00:10:20,142 --> 00:10:23,851
But it wasn't a total loss.
I mean, we ended up cuddling.

165
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,819
Whoa, you cuddled? How many times?

166
00:10:28,218 --> 00:10:29,890
Shut up. It was nice.

167
00:10:30,498 --> 00:10:33,410
I just don't think I'm
the dirty-talking kind of guy.

168
00:10:33,616 --> 00:10:35,846
Just say what you want to do to her.

169
00:10:36,095 --> 00:10:38,051
Or what you want her to do to you.

170
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:41,412
Or what you think other people
might be doing to each other.

171
00:10:41,853 --> 00:10:44,845
Look, I tell you what.
Try something on me.

172
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,804
Please be kidding.

173
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:52,405
Why not? Come on.

174
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:56,278
Just close your eyes and tell me
what you'd like to be doing right now.

175
00:11:03,485 --> 00:11:05,282
I'm in my apartment. . . .

176
00:11:06,244 --> 00:11:07,120
Yeah, what else?

177
00:11:07,323 --> 00:11:09,962
You're not there.
We're not having this conversation!

178
00:11:10,442 --> 00:11:12,273
-All right. I'll start.
-Joey, please.

179
00:11:12,481 --> 00:11:14,631
Come on, come on.
All right, ready?

180
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,554
Oh, Ross. . .

181
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:21,592
. . .you get me so hot,
I want your lips on me now.

182
00:11:23,437 --> 00:11:24,267
See?

183
00:11:27,756 --> 00:11:28,984
Now you say something.

184
00:11:29,195 --> 00:11:30,833
I really don't think so.

185
00:11:31,074 --> 00:11:32,109
Come on.

186
00:11:32,554 --> 00:11:33,907
You like this woman?

187
00:11:34,153 --> 00:11:35,427
-You wanna see her again?
-Sure.

188
00:11:35,672 --> 00:11:38,505
If you can't talk dirty to me,
how will you talk dirty to her?

189
00:11:38,751 --> 00:11:41,140
Now tell me you want
to caress my butt!

190
00:11:46,068 --> 00:11:47,547
Okay, turn around.

191
00:11:48,867 --> 00:11:51,176
I don't want you staring at me
while I do this.

192
00:11:51,386 --> 00:11:53,980
All right, all right.
I'm not looking. Go ahead.

193
00:11:54,185 --> 00:11:55,220
Okay.

194
00:11:58,464 --> 00:11:59,294
I want--

195
00:11:59,543 --> 00:12:01,579
Okay, I want. . .

196
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:02,971
. . .to feel. . .

197
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,941
. . .your hot, soft skin
with my lips.

198
00:12:06,421 --> 00:12:07,570
There you go.

199
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,373
Keep going, keep going.

200
00:12:15,257 --> 00:12:17,373
I want to take my tongue and--

201
00:12:26,973 --> 00:12:27,928
Say it.

202
00:12:31,211 --> 00:12:32,280
Say it!

203
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:36,602
--run it all over your body. . .

204
00:12:38,408 --> 00:12:40,603
. . .until you're trembling with--

205
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,155
With?

206
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,630
-Funny story.
-You're not gonna believe this.

207
00:13:04,878 --> 00:13:06,072
It's okay. It's okay.

208
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:09,355
I was always rooting for you
two kids to get together.

209
00:13:11,396 --> 00:13:14,229
While you were sleeping, that guy
from your old job called again.

210
00:13:14,474 --> 00:13:15,384
Again?

211
00:13:15,714 --> 00:13:18,547
-And again and again and again.
-And again.

212
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,307
And again!

213
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:29,259
Hey, Mr. Costilick.
How's life on the 1 5th floor?

214
00:13:30,348 --> 00:13:31,940
Yeah, I miss you too.

215
00:13:32,148 --> 00:13:35,743
It's a lot less satisfying
to steal pens from your own home.

216
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:39,134
That's very generous.

217
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,741
But look, this isn't about the money.

218
00:13:41,984 --> 00:13:46,341
I need something more than a job.
I need something I really care about--

219
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:49,535
That's on top of the year-end
bonus structure?

220
00:13:49,781 --> 00:13:51,009
-Your dream!
-Your dream!

221
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:54,536
Look, Al. Al, I'm not
playing hardball here, okay?

222
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:57,577
This is not a negotiation.
This is a rejection!

223
00:13:59,777 --> 00:14:01,176
Stop saying numbers!

224
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:04,726
I'm telling you, you've got
the wrong guy! You got the wrong guy!

225
00:14:04,975 --> 00:14:06,408
I'll see you Monday!

226
00:14:19,809 --> 00:14:21,925
Wow! It's huge!

227
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:25,120
It's so much bigger than the cubicle.

228
00:14:25,327 --> 00:14:27,283
This is a cube!

229
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:28,835
Look at this.

230
00:14:32,604 --> 00:14:34,322
You have a window!

231
00:14:35,683 --> 00:14:36,911
Yes, indeedy.

232
00:14:37,162 --> 00:14:41,314
-With a beautiful view of--
-Oh, look! That guy's peeing!

233
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,672
Okay. That's enough of the view.
Check this out.

234
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,117
Okay, sit down here. Sit down.

235
00:14:48,318 --> 00:14:50,513
This is great. This is great.

236
00:14:51,077 --> 00:14:52,271
You ready?

237
00:14:53,556 --> 00:14:55,626
Helen, could you come in here
for a moment?

238
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,307
Thank you, that'll be all.

239
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:06,623
Last time I do that.
I promise.

240
00:15:11,989 --> 00:15:13,707
Wendy, we had a deal.

241
00:15:13,948 --> 00:15:15,540
Yeah, you promised.

242
00:15:22,745 --> 00:15:23,939
Who was that?

243
00:15:26,064 --> 00:15:27,258
Wendy bailed.

244
00:15:27,463 --> 00:15:29,101
I have no waitress.

245
00:15:30,782 --> 00:15:32,613
That's too bad.

246
00:15:33,101 --> 00:15:33,897
Bye-bye.

247
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,093
-Ten dollars an hour!
-Nope.

248
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:38,528
$ 1 2 an hour.

249
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:42,130
I wish I could, but I've made plans
to walk around.

250
00:15:43,457 --> 00:15:46,415
When you ran out on your wedding,
I was there for you.

251
00:15:46,656 --> 00:15:50,365
I put a roof over your head,
and if that means nothing to you. . . .

252
00:15:51,134 --> 00:15:52,852
Twenty dollars an hour.

253
00:15:54,173 --> 00:15:55,128
Done.

254
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:05,285
Well, hello! Welcome to Monica's!
May I take your coat?

255
00:16:08,647 --> 00:16:10,558
-Hi, Steve.
-Hello, Monica.

256
00:16:10,766 --> 00:16:12,484
Hello, greeter girl.

257
00:16:13,445 --> 00:16:15,436
-This is Rachel.
-Yeah, okay.

258
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:19,880
Everything smells so delicious.

259
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:24,201
I can't remember a time I smelled
such a delicious combination of--

260
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,635
Okay, smells.

261
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,111
It's a lovely apartment.

262
00:16:29,359 --> 00:16:31,270
Thank you. Would you like a tour?

263
00:16:31,518 --> 00:16:34,078
I was just being polite,
but all right.

264
00:16:37,236 --> 00:16:38,191
What's up?

265
00:16:38,436 --> 00:16:42,395
In the cab on the way over,
Steve blazed up a doobie.

266
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:44,550
What?

267
00:16:45,233 --> 00:16:48,464
Smoked a joint, you know?
Lit a bone. Weed, hemp, ganja.

268
00:16:50,711 --> 00:16:52,702
Okay, I'm with you, Cheech.

269
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,421
Is it dry in here?

270
00:16:59,548 --> 00:17:01,664
Let me get you some wine.

271
00:17:01,947 --> 00:17:04,381
I think we're ready
for our first course too.

272
00:17:07,305 --> 00:17:09,455
These are rock shrimp ravioli. . .

273
00:17:09,704 --> 00:17:11,774
. . .in a cilantro ponzu sauce. . .

274
00:17:12,023 --> 00:17:14,253
. . .with just a touch of minced. . .

275
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,455
. . .ginger.

276
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:23,574
Well, smack my ass and call me Judy!

277
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:28,650
These are fantastic!

278
00:17:28,896 --> 00:17:31,330
Oh, gosh! I'm so glad you liked them.

279
00:17:31,615 --> 00:17:33,731
Like them? I couId eat 100 of them!

280
00:17:36,933 --> 00:17:38,969
That's all there is of these. . .

281
00:17:39,212 --> 00:17:42,363
. . .but in about 8 1 /2 minutes,
we'll serve some tartlets.

282
00:17:42,931 --> 00:17:44,250
''Tartlets?''

283
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,129
''Tartlets. ''

284
00:17:47,129 --> 00:17:48,562
''Tartlets. ''

285
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:52,405
Word has lost all meaning.

286
00:17:58,525 --> 00:18:01,244
Excuse me. Can I help you
with anything?

287
00:18:01,484 --> 00:18:03,839
You know, I don't know
what I'm looking for.

288
00:18:19,597 --> 00:18:21,110
Oh, cool! Taco shells!

289
00:18:23,795 --> 00:18:27,026
These are-- They are like a little
corn envelope, you know?

290
00:18:27,234 --> 00:18:29,668
You don't want to spoil your appetite.

291
00:18:30,672 --> 00:18:31,900
Sugar-O's!

292
00:18:32,192 --> 00:18:35,423
You know, if you just wait
another 6 1 /2 minutes--

293
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:37,706
Macaroni and cheese!
We gotta make this!

294
00:18:42,908 --> 00:18:44,387
No, we don't.

295
00:18:47,466 --> 00:18:48,501
Sorry.

296
00:18:52,864 --> 00:18:55,014
Why don't you just have a seat here?

297
00:19:00,741 --> 00:19:01,776
Give me the Gummy Bears.

298
00:19:06,259 --> 00:19:07,135
Give them to me.

299
00:19:07,338 --> 00:19:08,248
We'll share.

300
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,688
-No. Give me the bears.
-You can't have any.

301
00:19:10,897 --> 00:19:11,807
Give them to me!

302
00:19:12,016 --> 00:19:13,210
This is not working.

303
00:19:14,296 --> 00:19:16,969
Bears overboard! They're drowning!

304
00:19:17,774 --> 00:19:21,130
Hey, fellas! Grab onto a Sugar-O!
Save yourselves!

305
00:19:21,373 --> 00:19:24,809
Help! Help! I'm drowning! Help!

306
00:19:26,571 --> 00:19:28,084
That's it! Dinner is over!

307
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:29,206
-What?
-''What?''

308
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:30,883
-Why?
-''Why?''

309
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:33,279
I've waited seven years
for an opportunity like this. . .

310
00:19:33,488 --> 00:19:36,639
. . .and you can't even wait
4 1/2 minutes for a tartlet?

311
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,152
What a tool.

312
00:19:49,602 --> 00:19:51,797
You don't want to work
for a guy like that.

313
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:56,034
I know. It's just I just thought
that this was, you know, ''it. ''

314
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:57,997
You'll get there.
You're an amazing chef.

315
00:19:58,399 --> 00:20:00,833
You know those yummy noises?
I wasn't faking.

316
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,025
So how did it go with Celia?

317
00:20:12,393 --> 00:20:14,384
I was unbelievable.

318
00:20:14,592 --> 00:20:15,991
All right, Ross!

319
00:20:16,672 --> 00:20:19,391
I was the James Michener
of dirty talk.

320
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,905
It was the most elaborate filth
you have ever heard.

321
00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:25,300
I mean, there were characters,
plot lines. . .

322
00:20:25,788 --> 00:20:27,221
. . .themes, a motif.

323
00:20:27,467 --> 00:20:30,061
At one point, there were villagers.

324
00:20:31,826 --> 00:20:32,736
And. . . .

325
00:20:34,545 --> 00:20:37,582
Well, by the time we finished
with all the dirty talk. . .

326
00:20:37,823 --> 00:20:40,257
. . .it was late and we were
both exhausted, so. . . .

327
00:20:40,502 --> 00:20:42,970
-You cuddled.
-Yeah, which was nice.

328
00:20:43,461 --> 00:20:45,975
Do you guys want to try to catch
a late movie?

329
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,218
Shouldn't we wait for Chandler?

330
00:20:48,939 --> 00:20:50,657
Whoa! Where the hell is he?

331
00:20:51,138 --> 00:20:53,015
Yes, Fran, I know what time it is. . .

332
00:20:53,257 --> 00:20:56,374
. . .but I'm looking at the WENUS
and I'm not happy!

333
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:59,287
Oh, really?
Let me tell you something.

334
00:20:59,535 --> 00:21:03,972
You will care about it because
I care about it. Got it? Good!

335
00:21:19,167 --> 00:21:20,282
How's this?

336
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:23,242
Sorry. How about over here?

337
00:21:23,446 --> 00:21:25,164
That just means it's working.

338
00:21:25,405 --> 00:21:27,361
Does this hurt?

339
00:21:27,804 --> 00:21:29,362
How about this?

340
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:31,516
There you go!

341
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,429
Oh, the throb!
