1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,755
Here's little Ben nodding off.

2
00:00:03,401 --> 00:00:05,710
Look at Aunt Monica's Little boy.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,111
-Look, he's got Ross' hair cut.
-Let me see.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,919
Oh, God!
Is he just the sweetest thing?

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,958
You must just want
to kiss him all over.

6
00:00:19,801 --> 00:00:21,711
That would be nice.

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,356
Pardon?

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,519
Nothing. Just a Little
extra air in my mouth.

9
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,871
Chan, can you help me out here?
I promise I'II pay you back.

10
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:39,753
Yeah, right.
Including the waffles last week. . .

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,433
. . .you now owe me. . .

12
00:00:41,801 --> 00:00:43,917
. . . 17 jillion dollars.

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,319
Really, I'II pay you back this time.

14
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:48,911
Where's the money coming from?

15
00:00:49,161 --> 00:00:52,436
I'm helping out at the NYU
Med School with some research.

16
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,198
What kind of research?

17
00:00:56,161 --> 00:00:57,957
Just, you know, science.

18
00:00:58,801 --> 00:01:00,313
Science.

19
00:01:02,161 --> 00:01:04,197
Yeah, I think I've heard of that.

20
00:01:06,521 --> 00:01:08,239
It's a fertility study.

21
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,118
Please tell me you're only
donating your time.

22
00:01:15,801 --> 00:01:18,314
Come on, you guys.
It's not that big a deal.

23
00:01:18,521 --> 00:01:20,796
I just go down there
every other day. . .

24
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,112
. . .and make my contribution
to the project.

25
00:01:24,561 --> 00:01:27,075
But at the end of two weeks,
I get $ 700!

26
00:01:28,161 --> 00:01:30,914
You're gonna be making money
hand over fist.

27
00:01:33,281 --> 00:01:35,350
The One Where Rachel Finds Out

28
00:01:36,641 --> 00:01:37,629
English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

29
00:02:20,121 --> 00:02:22,475
Okay, we got the coleslaw.
We got the buns.

30
00:02:22,721 --> 00:02:26,759
We've got the ground-up flesh
of formally cute cows and turkeys.

31
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,919
Men are here!

32
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,913
We make fire.

33
00:02:38,961 --> 00:02:40,360
Cook meat.

34
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,433
Then put out fire by peeing,
no get invited back!

35
00:02:43,681 --> 00:02:44,874
Cute, cute!

36
00:02:45,161 --> 00:02:47,355
Joey, Melanie called.
She's gonna be late.

37
00:02:48,161 --> 00:02:49,639
So how are things going?

38
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,395
Is she becoming your special someone?

39
00:02:54,401 --> 00:02:57,120
I don't know.
She's pretty great.

40
00:02:57,401 --> 00:03:00,518
What does she think of
your Little science project?

41
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,110
You think I'd tell a girl I like
that I'm also seeing a cup?

42
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,319
The man's got a point.

43
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,037
The tough thing is, she really wants
to have sex with me.

44
00:03:14,281 --> 00:03:16,111
Crazy bitch!

45
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,437
I got a week left in the program,
and according to the rules. . .

46
00:03:24,681 --> 00:03:28,310
. . .to get the money, I can't conduct
any personal experiments. . .

47
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,954
. . .if you know what I mean.

48
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,236
Joey, we always know what you mean.

49
00:03:40,681 --> 00:03:43,717
How long did you think
this barbecue was gonna Last?

50
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,429
I'm going to China.

51
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,437
Jeez, you say one thing and. . . .

52
00:03:49,281 --> 00:03:50,395
You're going to China?

53
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,194
It's for the museum.
Someone found a bone.

54
00:03:53,401 --> 00:03:55,356
They don't want us
to have the bone.

55
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,639
So I'm going to try to persuade them--
It's a whole big bone thing.

56
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,355
Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for a week.

57
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,913
So if you wanna reach me, you can't.
So here's my itinerary.

58
00:04:09,721 --> 00:04:12,314
-Here's a picture of me.
-Oh, let me see.

59
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,879
Could you show it to Ben now and then
so he doesn't forget me?

60
00:04:18,201 --> 00:04:19,235
Hi, Ben.

61
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,199
I'm your father.

62
00:04:23,401 --> 00:04:25,516
I am The Head!

63
00:04:30,721 --> 00:04:32,312
This barbecue's gonna be fun.

64
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:37,196
Is Rachel here? I wanted to wish her
a happy birthday before I Left.

65
00:04:37,401 --> 00:04:39,516
She's out having drinks with Carl.

66
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,113
Hey, who's Carl?

67
00:04:44,721 --> 00:04:46,915
You know, that guy she met
at the coffeehouse.

68
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:51,153
-See, there's this guy she met at--
-The coffeehouse? Right.

69
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,639
So you do know who he is.

70
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,752
I'm gonna go say goodbye
to the guys.

71
00:04:59,961 --> 00:05:02,428
You know what?
Tell them that bone story.

72
00:05:10,081 --> 00:05:12,470
-I have to go to China.
-The country?

73
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:17,432
No, this big pile of dishes
in my mom's breakfront.

74
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,793
Do you guys know who Carl is?

75
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,232
Let's see.
Alvin, Simon, Theodore. . . .

76
00:05:26,761 --> 00:05:29,115
Rachel’s having
drinks with him tonight.

77
00:05:29,401 --> 00:05:31,834
How can she, when she's never
shown interest in you?

78
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,033
Forget about her.

79
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,120
He's right, man. Please move on.
Go to China. Eat Chinese food.

80
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,028
Of course, there,
they just call it food.

81
00:05:44,081 --> 00:05:45,958
I guess. I don't know.

82
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:49,918
AII right, just give her this
for me, okay?

83
00:05:50,161 --> 00:05:53,516
We're just looking out for you.
We want you to be happy.

84
00:05:53,761 --> 00:05:57,435
And I may only have a couple beers
in me, but I love you, man.

85
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:01,672
I'm still on my first.

86
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,072
I just think you're nice.

87
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,749
That's when me and my friends
started this fruit-basket business.

88
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:20,920
We call ourselves
''The Three Basketeers. ''

89
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,314
Like ''The Three Musketeers,''
only with fruit.

90
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,754
-How do you Like your burgers?
-No. Presents first, food later!

91
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,949
Hold on there, tiger.

92
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,194
How are you holding up?

93
00:06:39,401 --> 00:06:40,754
Well, not so good.

94
00:06:40,961 --> 00:06:44,350
She thinks we're gonna
complete the transaction tonight. . .

95
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,834
. . .if you know what I--

96
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:47,355
And you do!

97
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,038
So have you ever thought about
being there for her?

98
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,913
What do you mean?

99
00:06:56,721 --> 00:06:59,281
You know, just be there for her.

100
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,314
Not following you.

101
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,319
Think about it.

102
00:07:13,721 --> 00:07:18,112
I'm guessing this is from. . . .

103
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,718
Well, thank you, Melanie.

104
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,117
This one right here is from me.

105
00:07:26,401 --> 00:07:27,720
It's light.

106
00:07:28,201 --> 00:07:29,315
It rattles.

107
00:07:29,521 --> 00:07:30,509
It's. . .

108
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,315
. . .Travel Scrabble!

109
00:07:37,401 --> 00:07:38,516
Thank you.

110
00:07:42,721 --> 00:07:43,949
This one's from Joey.

111
00:07:44,161 --> 00:07:45,673
It feels Like a book.
I think it's a book.

112
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,271
And it's a book!

113
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,990
It's Dr. Seuss!

114
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,990
That book got me through
some tough times.

115
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:58,355
There is a Little child
inside this man.

116
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,358
The doctors say if they remove it,
he'll die!

117
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,151
-Who's this from?
-That's Ross' .

118
00:08:12,161 --> 00:08:13,514
Oh, my God!

119
00:08:14,881 --> 00:08:16,108
He remembered!

120
00:08:16,521 --> 00:08:17,509
Remembered what?

121
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,149
It was months ago.

122
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,716
We were walking by this antique store,
and I saw this pin.

123
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:27,432
I told him it was just Like one
my grandmother had when I was Little.

124
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,990
I can't believe he remembered!

125
00:08:30,401 --> 00:08:33,119
Well, sure, but can you
play it on a plane?

126
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,516
It's so pretty!

127
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,154
This must've cost him a fortune.

128
00:08:42,361 --> 00:08:43,476
I can't believe he did this.

129
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,911
Remember when he
fell in Love with Carol. . .

130
00:08:46,121 --> 00:08:49,511
. . .and bought her that ridiculously
expensive crystal duck?

131
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,715
What did you say?

132
00:09:03,761 --> 00:09:05,160
Crystal duck.

133
00:09:13,001 --> 00:09:14,638
The ''Love'' part?

134
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,713
Oh, my God!

135
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,430
That's good.
Just keep rubbing your head.

136
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,512
That'll turn back time.

137
00:09:37,001 --> 00:09:40,276
This is unbelievable.
I mean, this is unbelievable!

138
00:09:40,601 --> 00:09:43,035
I know.
This is really, really huge!

139
00:09:43,361 --> 00:09:47,559
No, it's not. It's small,
it's tiny, it's petite, it's wee.

140
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,555
I don't think any of our lives
will ever be the same ever again!

141
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,388
Is there a mute button
on this woman?

142
00:09:56,601 --> 00:09:59,832
I think this is so great!
I mean, you and Ross!

143
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,354
Did you have any idea?

144
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,159
No, none!

145
00:10:03,401 --> 00:10:06,438
My first night in the city,
he mentioned asking me out. . .

146
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,114
. . .but nothing ever happened,
so I just. . . .

147
00:10:09,361 --> 00:10:12,319
What else did he say?
Does he want to go out with me?

148
00:10:12,601 --> 00:10:14,353
Given that he's desperately
in Love with you. . .

149
00:10:14,601 --> 00:10:17,512
. . .he wouldn’t mind getting
a cup of coffee or something.

150
00:10:18,521 --> 00:10:19,714
Ross?

151
00:10:20,361 --> 00:10:21,953
AII this time?

152
00:10:22,281 --> 00:10:24,316
-I've gotta talk to him.
-He's in China!

153
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,675
The country.

154
00:10:27,401 --> 00:10:30,074
Wait, his flight doesn't leave
for 45 minutes.

155
00:10:30,281 --> 00:10:33,397
-What about the time difference?
-From here to the airport?

156
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,635
-You're never gonna make it!
-I've got to try.

157
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,910
What'll you say to him?

158
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,155
I don't know.

159
00:10:41,401 --> 00:10:42,516
Then maybe you shouldn’t go.

160
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,236
Right, because if you're gonna
break his heart, that can wait.

161
00:10:46,481 --> 00:10:48,391
But if it's good news,
tell him now.

162
00:10:48,601 --> 00:10:50,079
Maybe I'II know when I see him.

163
00:10:50,281 --> 00:10:52,714
Here, look.
AII right, does this help?

164
00:11:00,401 --> 00:11:04,109
AII I know is, I cannot wait a week.
This is just too big.

165
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,709
I've just got to talk to him.
I've got--

166
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,155
I'II see you Later.

167
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,237
I Love you!

168
00:11:10,481 --> 00:11:11,914
Deal with me first!

169
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,837
AII right.

170
00:11:30,761 --> 00:11:32,239
Excuse me, pardon me.

171
00:11:32,481 --> 00:11:33,516
Your boarding pass?

172
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:35,558
I don't have one.
I need to talk to my friend.

173
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:39,549
Sorry, you're not allowed on
the jetway without a boarding pass.

174
00:11:39,761 --> 00:11:42,797
He's right there,
in the blue jacket! Can I just--?

175
00:11:43,001 --> 00:11:44,877
I'm sorry.
Federal regulations!

176
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:48,954
AII right, then could you please
just give him a message for me?

177
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,599
This is very important.

178
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,031
AII right.
What's the message?

179
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,718
I don't know.

180
00:11:57,601 --> 00:11:58,829
Excuse me! Sir!

181
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,354
Excuse me! Sir?

182
00:12:00,601 --> 00:12:02,159
I have a message for you.

183
00:12:02,401 --> 00:12:06,314
Rachel said she loved the present.
She'll see you when you get back.

184
00:12:06,521 --> 00:12:07,714
What?

185
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,159
Toby, I don't know
what she's talking about.

186
00:12:12,401 --> 00:12:13,800
There's no Rachel!

187
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,112
Don't give me that deep freeze!

188
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,709
Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey!

189
00:12:29,401 --> 00:12:32,313
I think I blacked out there
for a minute.

190
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,319
It was nothing.

191
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,910
Well, now we gotta
find something fun for you!

192
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,393
You know what?

193
00:12:46,601 --> 00:12:49,991
Forget about me.
Let's give you another turn.

194
00:12:52,401 --> 00:12:53,675
Me, again?

195
00:12:53,881 --> 00:12:56,111
Sure. Why not?

196
00:12:58,761 --> 00:13:03,391
Boy! Somebody's gonna get
a big fruit basket tomorrow!

197
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,558
I gotta tell you, you are nothing Like
I thought you would be.

198
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,670
How do you mean?

199
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,111
I just had you pegged as one of those
guys who are always, ''Me, me, me! ''

200
00:13:19,361 --> 00:13:20,237
But you. . .

201
00:13:21,121 --> 00:13:22,270
. . .you're a giver.

202
00:13:23,601 --> 00:13:25,955
You're, Like, the most generous
man I ever met.

203
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,431
I mean, you're practically a woman.

204
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,280
So Rach, do you want to save
this wrapping paper?

205
00:13:38,481 --> 00:13:39,709
It's only a Little torn.

206
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,032
Are you gonna go for it with Ross,
or should I throw it out?

207
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,119
I don't know.

208
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,954
I don't know.

209
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,950
I thought about it
all of the way there. . .

210
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,318
. . .and I thought about it
all the way back and. . . .

211
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,152
You know, it's Ross!

212
00:13:57,361 --> 00:13:59,511
You know what I mean?
It's Ross.

213
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,915
-Sure!
-Sure.

214
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,919
I don't know. This is just
my initial gut feeling. . .

215
00:14:07,121 --> 00:14:08,713
. . .but I'm thinking. . .

216
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:11,074
. . .it'd be really great.

217
00:14:11,281 --> 00:14:14,717
Oh, my God, me too!
We'd be Like friends-in-law!

218
00:14:16,001 --> 00:14:18,834
The best part is you already
know all about him.

219
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,196
It's Like starting on the 1 5th date.

220
00:14:21,401 --> 00:14:24,710
But it would be Like
starting on the 1 5th date.

221
00:14:25,601 --> 00:14:27,353
Another good point.

222
00:14:29,361 --> 00:14:33,752
At the 1 5th date, you're already
in a ''relationship-py'' place.

223
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:34,955
You're committed.

224
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,516
What happens if it doesn't work out?

225
00:14:40,761 --> 00:14:41,795
Why isn't it working out?

226
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,679
Sometimes it doesn't.

227
00:14:43,881 --> 00:14:47,351
Is he not cute enough for you?
Does he not make enough money?

228
00:14:47,641 --> 00:14:48,550
No, I'm just--

229
00:14:48,761 --> 00:14:50,160
Maybe there's someone else.

230
00:14:50,401 --> 00:14:52,311
Is there?
Is there someone else?

231
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,121
No, there is no one else.

232
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,920
Then why the hell
are you dumping my brother?

233
00:15:08,121 --> 00:15:09,314
Hey, big--

234
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,637
Spender!

235
00:15:13,481 --> 00:15:15,039
She's still asleep.

236
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,589
-So how'd it go?
-It was amazing!

237
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,752
You know how you think
you're great in bed?

238
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,351
The fact you'd even ask
shows how Little you know me.

239
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,633
Well, Last night
I couldn’t do the thing. . .

240
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,718
. . .that usually makes me great.

241
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,911
So I had to do
all this other stuff.

242
00:15:31,161 --> 00:15:34,118
And the response I got!
Man, oh, man!

243
00:15:34,361 --> 00:15:36,352
It was Like
a ticker-tape parade!

244
00:15:38,281 --> 00:15:41,670
I know. My room's very close
to the parade route.

245
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:49,714
It was amazing,
and not just for her.

246
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,757
For me too!

247
00:15:51,001 --> 00:15:53,959
It's Like, all of a sudden
I'm blind. . .

248
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,151
. . .but all my other senses
are heightened.

249
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,911
You know? It's Like,
I was able to appreciate it. . .

250
00:16:00,161 --> 00:16:02,071
. . .on another level.

251
00:16:04,521 --> 00:16:06,876
I didn't know you had
another Level.

252
00:16:07,361 --> 00:16:09,157
I know. Neither did I!

253
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,510
Hey, great skirts!
Birthday present?

254
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,119
-From who?
-From you!

255
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,834
I exchanged the blouse
you got me.

256
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,518
Well, it's the thought.

257
00:16:28,281 --> 00:16:30,714
Doesn't Ross' flight get in
in a couple hours?

258
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,672
At gate 27B?

259
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,151
I've been thinking about it.

260
00:16:38,401 --> 00:16:41,676
I've decided this Ross thing
is not a good idea.

261
00:16:41,881 --> 00:16:42,676
Why?

262
00:16:42,881 --> 00:16:46,156
Because I feel Like I wouldn’t
just be going out with him.

263
00:16:46,401 --> 00:16:48,516
I would be going out with
all of you.

264
00:16:48,761 --> 00:16:50,160
There'd be all this pressure and--

265
00:16:50,401 --> 00:16:52,118
No pressure, no pressure!

266
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,679
Nothing has even happened yet
and you're already so--

267
00:16:56,881 --> 00:16:58,155
I'm not ''so. ''

268
00:16:58,401 --> 00:17:00,516
I was a teensy bit weird at first. . .

269
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,713
. . .but I'II be good.
I promise.

270
00:17:08,521 --> 00:17:09,431
Who is it?

271
00:17:09,681 --> 00:17:10,954
It's me, Carl.

272
00:17:11,201 --> 00:17:12,235
Come on up.

273
00:17:12,441 --> 00:17:14,113
Behind my brother's back?

274
00:17:15,721 --> 00:17:19,235
Is the kind of crazy thing
you won't be hearing from me.

275
00:17:32,201 --> 00:17:33,316
Seven hundred bucks!

276
00:17:33,521 --> 00:17:35,351
AII right, you did it!

277
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,954
Do we have any fruit?

278
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,712
Man! A hell of a two weeks.

279
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:44,873
You know what, though?
I really feel I learned something.

280
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,595
So you'll stick with this
''it's all for her'' thing?

281
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,313
What, are you crazy?

282
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,918
When a blind man gets his sight back,
does he walk around Like this?

283
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,715
I'm just saying, if I see one more
picture of Ed Begley Jr. . .

284
00:18:02,921 --> 00:18:04,717
. . .in that stupid electric car. . .

285
00:18:04,921 --> 00:18:06,240
. . .I'II shoot myself!

286
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,352
Don't get me wrong. I'm not against
environmental issues, per se. . .

287
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,799
. . .it's just that guy!

288
00:18:14,281 --> 00:18:17,716
I can't believe you'd rather
go out with him than me.

289
00:18:18,521 --> 00:18:21,319
Excuse me, please.
I'm trying to have a date here.

290
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,871
Fine, just stop thinking about me.

291
00:18:27,281 --> 00:18:29,350
Can't do it, can you?

292
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,350
So I'm thinking about you.
So what?

293
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,637
I don't get it. What do you see
in this guy anyway?

294
00:18:36,761 --> 00:18:39,069
Well, he seems to be
a very nice guy.

295
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,279
I mean, come on, buddy!
Get a real car!

296
00:18:45,201 --> 00:18:46,553
Rachel, come on.

297
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,712
Give us a chance.

298
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,914
It's too hard.

299
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,358
Because it'll get weird
for everyone else?

300
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,557
Who cares?
This is about us.

301
00:18:55,921 --> 00:18:59,117
I've been in Love with you
since the ninth grade.

302
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,921
-You're, Like, my best friend.
-I know.

303
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,873
If we broke up, and I lost you--

304
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,799
Why do you think
we'll break up?

305
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,715
Have you been involved with someone
where you haven't broken up?

306
00:19:12,201 --> 00:19:12,996
No.

307
00:19:13,921 --> 00:19:17,515
But it only has to happen once.

308
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,759
You and I know
we are perfect for each other.

309
00:19:21,001 --> 00:19:21,955
Right?

310
00:19:22,521 --> 00:19:25,752
So the only question is:
Are you attracted to me?

311
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,029
I don't know.

312
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,918
I mean, I've never looked at you
that way before.

313
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,200
Well start Looking!

314
00:19:47,481 --> 00:19:48,629
Exactly!

315
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,717
And you just know
I'm gonna be the guy. . .

316
00:19:50,961 --> 00:19:53,713
. . .caught behind this hammerhead
in traffic!

317
00:19:56,201 --> 00:19:57,349
Right!

318
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,750
You're right!

319
00:19:59,521 --> 00:20:00,556
You know what?

320
00:20:00,961 --> 00:20:03,998
I forgot, I need to pick up
a friend at the airport.

321
00:20:04,201 --> 00:20:06,156
I am so sorry!

322
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,518
If you want to stay
and finish your drinks, please do.

323
00:20:09,721 --> 00:20:12,188
I'm sorry, I gotta go.
I'm sorry!

324
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,595
But. . . .

325
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,077
Excuse me! Pardon me!

326
00:20:25,281 --> 00:20:26,110
I'm sorry.

327
00:20:26,721 --> 00:20:27,550
Toby. . .

328
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,712
. . .for God's sake,
will you Let it go?

329
00:20:29,961 --> 00:20:31,552
There's no Rachel!

330
00:20:37,721 --> 00:20:38,915
I got that!

331
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,517
-Thanks, sweetie.
-No problem.

332
00:20:47,481 --> 00:20:49,711
I cannot wait
for you to meet my friends!

333
00:20:49,921 --> 00:20:52,560
Really? You don't think
they'll judge and ridicule me?

334
00:20:52,761 --> 00:20:54,114
No, they will.
I just. . . .

335
00:20:54,521 --> 00:20:55,350
-Can't wait!
-Can't wait!

336
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,716
Come on, they're gonna Love you.
