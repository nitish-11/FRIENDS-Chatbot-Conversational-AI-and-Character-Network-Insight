00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,173
Everybody! Central Perk
is proud to present. . .

2
00:00:04,618 --> 00:00:08,167
. . .the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.

3
00:00:10,776 --> 00:00:11,572
Thanks.

4
00:00:12,815 --> 00:00:15,454
I wanna start with a song
that's about that moment. . .

5
00:00:15,694 --> 00:00:19,130
. . .when you suddenly realize
what life is really all about.

6
00:00:19,892 --> 00:00:21,007
Here we go.

7
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,409
Thank you very much.

8
00:00:39,604 --> 00:00:41,959
Oh, great! This is just--

9
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:49,672
The One With the Blackout

11
00:01:36,461 --> 00:01:38,179
This is so cool, you guys.

12
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,376
The entire city's blacked out.

13
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,008
Mom says it's Manhattan,
Brooklyn and Queens. . .

14
00:01:43,218 --> 00:01:45,448
. . .and doesn't know when
it'll be back on.

15
00:01:45,657 --> 00:01:47,136
You guys, this is big.

16
00:01:47,377 --> 00:01:49,572
Pants and a sweater.
Why, Mom?

17
00:01:49,816 --> 00:01:51,488
Who will I meet in a blackout?

18
00:01:52,934 --> 00:01:56,165
Power-company guys?
Eligible looters?

19
00:01:56,573 --> 00:01:58,370
Can we talk about this later?

20
00:01:59,332 --> 00:02:00,401
Can I borrow the phone?

21
00:02:00,651 --> 00:02:03,768
I wanna call my apartment
and check on my grandma.

22
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,444
What's my number?

23
00:02:07,249 --> 00:02:08,921
I never call me.

24
00:02:10,567 --> 00:02:12,000
Oh, my God! It's her.

25
00:02:12,247 --> 00:02:14,158
It's that Victoria Secret model.

26
00:02:14,366 --> 00:02:15,685
Something Goodacre.

27
00:02:15,925 --> 00:02:17,199
Hi, Mom, it's Jill.

28
00:02:17,444 --> 00:02:19,753
She's right. It's Jill.
Jill Goodacre.

29
00:02:20,443 --> 00:02:21,796
Oh, my God!

30
00:02:22,043 --> 00:02:25,718
I am trapped in an A TM vestibule
with Jill Goodacre.

31
00:02:26,841 --> 00:02:29,753
Is it a vestibule?
Maybe it's an atrium?

32
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:33,748
Yeah, that is the part
to focus on, you idiot.

33
00:02:34,797 --> 00:02:38,506
I'm fine. I'm just stuck
at the bank in an ATM vestibule.

34
00:02:38,756 --> 00:02:40,587
Jill says vestibule...

35
00:02:40,835 --> 00:02:42,951
...I'm going with vestibule.

36
00:02:43,794 --> 00:02:44,829
I'm fine.

37
00:02:45,193 --> 00:02:46,945
No, I'm not alone.

38
00:02:47,432 --> 00:02:48,911
I don't know, some guy.

39
00:02:49,152 --> 00:02:53,191
Oh, some guy. I am some guy.

40
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,990
Hey Jill, I saw you
with some guy last night.

41
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:58,868
Yes, he was some guy.

42
00:03:07,624 --> 00:03:09,342
Hey, everyone.

43
00:03:15,501 --> 00:03:18,220
Officiating at tonight's blackout
is Rabbi Tribbiani.

44
00:03:22,298 --> 00:03:26,576
Chandler's old roommate was Jewish, and
these are the only candles we have. . .

45
00:03:26,816 --> 00:03:27,965
. . .so happy Hanukkah!

46
00:03:29,935 --> 00:03:33,132
Look! Ugly Naked Guy
lit a bunch of candles.

47
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:42,128
That had to hurt!

48
00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:46,362
All right, all right!
It's been 14 1/2 minutes...

49
00:03:46,608 --> 00:03:49,281
...and you still haven 't said
one word. Oh, God!

50
00:03:49,567 --> 00:03:53,116
Do something!
Just make contact. Smile!

51
00:03:56,604 --> 00:03:58,037
There you go.

52
00:04:01,722 --> 00:04:03,758
You're definitely scaring her.

53
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:06,432
Would you like to call somebody?

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,310
Yeah, about 300 guys I went
to high school with.

55
00:04:15,517 --> 00:04:17,109
Yeah, thanks.

56
00:04:21,514 --> 00:04:22,310
It's me.

57
00:04:22,514 --> 00:04:23,424
It's Chandler.

58
00:04:23,673 --> 00:04:24,662
Are you okay?

59
00:04:24,913 --> 00:04:26,312
I'm fine.

60
00:04:26,672 --> 00:04:30,301
I'm stuck in an ATM vestibule. . .

61
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:34,428
. . .with Jill Goodacre.

62
00:04:35,269 --> 00:04:36,065
What?

63
00:04:36,308 --> 00:04:38,105
I'm stuck. . .

64
00:04:38,787 --> 00:04:41,381
. . .in an ATM vestibule. . .

65
00:04:41,586 --> 00:04:43,702
. . .with Jill Goodacre.

66
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:46,737
I have no idea what you said.

67
00:04:46,984 --> 00:04:48,781
Put Joey on the phone.

68
00:04:51,982 --> 00:04:52,858
What's up, man?

69
00:04:53,101 --> 00:04:54,329
I'm stuck. . .

70
00:04:54,981 --> 00:04:57,541
. . .in an ATM vestibule. . .

71
00:04:58,099 --> 00:05:00,693
. . .with Jill Goodacre!

72
00:05:01,938 --> 00:05:02,927
Oh, my God!

73
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:06,328
He's trapped in an ATM vestibule
with Jill Goodacre!

74
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,364
Chandler, listen.

75
00:05:13,253 --> 00:05:15,892
Like that thought
never entered my mind.

76
00:05:19,371 --> 00:05:20,645
Come on, somebody.

77
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,124
I'll go. I'll go.

78
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:26,369
Senior year of college,
on a pool table.

79
00:05:26,568 --> 00:05:28,001
Pool table?

80
00:05:28,247 --> 00:05:29,885
That's my sister.

81
00:05:31,966 --> 00:05:34,685
My weirdest place would have to be. . .

82
00:05:34,924 --> 00:05:39,281
. . .the women's room on the second floor
of the New York City Public Library.

83
00:05:39,483 --> 00:05:42,281
Oh, my God! What were you
doing in a library?

84
00:05:44,321 --> 00:05:45,879
Pheebs, what about you?

85
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,079
Milwaukee.

86
00:05:52,237 --> 00:05:53,955
Ross?

87
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:58,826
Disneyland, 1989.
''It's a small world after all. ''

88
00:06:01,114 --> 00:06:02,149
No way!

89
00:06:02,393 --> 00:06:03,667
The ride broke down. . .

90
00:06:03,873 --> 00:06:07,832
. . .so Carol and I went behind a couple
of those mechanical Dutch children.

91
00:06:09,231 --> 00:06:13,463
They fixed the ride, and we were asked
never to return to the Magic Kingdom.

92
00:06:14,748 --> 00:06:15,703
Rachel?

93
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,057
I already went.

94
00:06:17,307 --> 00:06:19,104
-You did not go.
-Yes, I did.

95
00:06:19,306 --> 00:06:20,819
Tell us. Come on.

96
00:06:22,065 --> 00:06:25,660
The weirdest place would have to be. . .

97
00:06:28,063 --> 00:06:29,860
. . .the foot of the bed.

98
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,975
-Step back!
-We have a winner!

99
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:43,969
I've never had a relationship
with that kind of passion.

100
00:06:44,216 --> 00:06:48,129
Where you have to have somebody right
there in the middle of a theme park.

101
00:06:51,134 --> 00:06:54,410
It was the only thing to do there
that didn't have a line.

102
00:06:56,092 --> 00:06:59,971
Barry wouldn't even kiss me
on a miniature golf course.

103
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,000
Come on.

104
00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:03,803
He said we were holding up
the people behind us.

105
00:07:04,688 --> 00:07:06,724
And you didn't marry him because. . .?

106
00:07:08,526 --> 00:07:11,962
Do you think there are people
that go through life. . .

107
00:07:12,205 --> 00:07:14,514
. . .never having that kind of. . .?

108
00:07:14,764 --> 00:07:16,277
-Probably.
-Really?

109
00:07:16,523 --> 00:07:19,674
I'll tell you something.
Passion is way overrated.

110
00:07:19,922 --> 00:07:21,321
-Yeah, right.
-It is.

111
00:07:22,001 --> 00:07:24,151
Eventually, it kind of burns out.

112
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,996
But hopefully what you're left
with is trust and security and. . . .

113
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,109
In my ex-wife's case,
lesbianism.

114
00:07:36,715 --> 00:07:40,264
For all those people who miss out
on that passion thing. . .

115
00:07:40,514 --> 00:07:42,027
. . .there's other good stuff.

116
00:07:45,272 --> 00:07:47,149
But I don't think that'll be you.

117
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,185
You don't?

118
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:53,739
I see big passion in your future.

119
00:07:53,948 --> 00:07:54,744
Really?

120
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:56,941
-You do?
-I do.

121
00:07:57,667 --> 00:07:59,020
Ross, you're so great.

122
00:08:09,702 --> 00:08:11,818
It's never gonna happen.

123
00:08:18,418 --> 00:08:19,328
What?

124
00:08:19,578 --> 00:08:20,408
You and Rachel.

125
00:08:29,374 --> 00:08:30,409
Why not?

126
00:08:32,452 --> 00:08:34,761
Because you waited too long
to make your move. . .

127
00:08:34,971 --> 00:08:37,804
. . .and now you're in the ''Friend Zone. ''

128
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:40,759
I'm not in the Zone.

129
00:08:41,009 --> 00:08:42,965
No, Ross.
You're mayor of the Zone.

130
00:08:44,847 --> 00:08:47,202
Look, I'm taking my time, all right?

131
00:08:47,406 --> 00:08:49,203
I'm laying the groundwork.

132
00:08:49,406 --> 00:08:51,874
Every day I get
a little bit closer to. . . .

133
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:53,194
Priesthood!

134
00:08:55,403 --> 00:08:58,600
I'm telling you, she has
no idea what you're thinking.

135
00:08:58,802 --> 00:09:02,875
If you don't ask her out soon,
you'll end up stuck in the Zone forever.

136
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,519
I will, I will.

137
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:06,989
I'm waiting for the right moment.

138
00:09:09,597 --> 00:09:10,791
What?

139
00:09:11,477 --> 00:09:12,273
What, now?

140
00:09:15,235 --> 00:09:16,509
What's messing you up?
The wine?

141
00:09:16,755 --> 00:09:19,394
The candles? The moonlight?

142
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:22,983
You gotta go up to her and say,
''Look, Rachel, I think--''

143
00:09:24,951 --> 00:09:26,703
-What are we shushing?
-We're shushing. . .

144
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:30,262
. . .because we're trying to
hear something.

145
00:09:30,509 --> 00:09:31,783
What?

146
00:09:32,268 --> 00:09:33,781
Don't you hear that?

147
00:09:38,906 --> 00:09:40,180
See?

148
00:09:44,863 --> 00:09:46,216
Would you like some gum?

149
00:09:46,462 --> 00:09:47,338
Is it sugarless?

150
00:09:49,781 --> 00:09:51,817
-Sorry, it's not.
-Then, no thanks.

151
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,379
What the hell was that?

152
00:09:55,779 --> 00:09:59,613
Mental note: If Jill Goodacre
offers you gum, you take it.

153
00:09:59,857 --> 00:10:03,770
If she offers you mangled
animal carcass, you take it!

154
00:10:06,015 --> 00:10:09,087
New York City has no power

155
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:12,769
And the milk is getting sour

156
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:16,209
But to me it is not scary

157
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:20,363
'Cause I stay away from dairy

158
00:10:29,245 --> 00:10:30,564
-Here goes.
-You'll do it?

159
00:10:30,765 --> 00:10:32,164
-I'll do it.
-Want help?

160
00:10:32,404 --> 00:10:34,554
You come out there,
you're a dead man.

161
00:10:37,122 --> 00:10:38,077
Good luck, man.

162
00:10:38,961 --> 00:10:40,155
Thanks.

163
00:10:49,037 --> 00:10:50,595
-Where you going?
-Outside.

164
00:10:50,796 --> 00:10:51,751
You can't!

165
00:10:52,396 --> 00:10:53,192
Why not?

166
00:10:53,435 --> 00:10:55,471
Because of the reason.

167
00:10:57,634 --> 00:10:58,430
That would be. . .?

168
00:11:00,033 --> 00:11:00,829
I can't tell you.

169
00:11:01,072 --> 00:11:02,107
What's going on?

170
00:11:03,631 --> 00:11:07,624
Listen. You gotta promise you'll
never, ever tell Ross that I told you.

171
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:10,583
-About what?
-He's planning your birthday party.

172
00:11:12,228 --> 00:11:13,980
Oh, my God! I love him!

173
00:11:14,227 --> 00:11:15,626
You better act surprised.

174
00:11:15,866 --> 00:11:16,662
About what?

175
00:11:16,906 --> 00:11:18,055
My surprise party.

176
00:11:18,265 --> 00:11:22,144
-What surprise party?
-Oh, stop it. Joey already told me.

177
00:11:22,743 --> 00:11:24,176
Well, he didn't tell me.

178
00:11:24,823 --> 00:11:27,576
Don't look at me.
This is Ross' thing.

179
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:30,972
This is so typical. I'm always
the last to know everything.

180
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,051
You are not. We tell you stuff.

181
00:11:33,939 --> 00:11:38,376
I was the last one to know when Chandler
got bit by the peacock at the zoo.

182
00:11:39,097 --> 00:11:42,931
I was the last to know you had a crush
on Joey when he was moving in.

183
00:11:44,974 --> 00:11:46,805
Looks like I was second to last.

184
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,930
It's so nice.

185
00:11:58,369 --> 00:12:00,121
I have a question.

186
00:12:01,728 --> 00:12:04,162
Actually, it's not
so much a question. . .

187
00:12:04,407 --> 00:12:06,921
. . .it's more of a general wondering. . . .

188
00:12:07,885 --> 00:12:09,113
--ment.

189
00:12:12,203 --> 00:12:13,716
Here goes.

190
00:12:16,282 --> 00:12:19,911
Well, for a while now,
I've been wanting to. . . .

191
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,638
Yes, that's right.

192
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,069
Look at that little kitty!

193
00:12:28,557 --> 00:12:32,948
I'm on the top of the world
Looking down on creation

194
00:12:33,195 --> 00:12:38,110
And the only explanation I can find

195
00:12:38,593 --> 00:12:43,269
Is the love that I found
Ever since you've been around

196
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:47,709
All right, this is just Bactine.
It won't hurt.

197
00:12:50,868 --> 00:12:53,098
Sorry, that was wax.

198
00:12:55,226 --> 00:12:58,343
Poor little Tootie's scared.
We should find his owner.

199
00:12:58,585 --> 00:13:00,815
Why not put ''poor little Tootie''
in the hall?

200
00:13:01,943 --> 00:13:04,582
During a blackout?
She'll get trampled.

201
00:13:08,781 --> 00:13:11,295
On second thought,
gum would be perfection.

202
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:14,257
Gum would be perfection?

203
00:13:15,418 --> 00:13:17,488
Gum would be perfection.

204
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:21,133
Could've said, ''Gum would be nice. ''
''I'll have a stick. '' But, no.

205
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:24,447
For me, gum is perfection.

206
00:13:25,494 --> 00:13:28,247
I loathe myself!

207
00:13:30,692 --> 00:13:34,082
Oh, no, the Mellons.
They hate all living things, right?

208
00:13:40,568 --> 00:13:41,967
We just found this cat. . .

209
00:13:42,207 --> 00:13:43,640
. . .and we're looking for the owner.

210
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,162
It's mine.

211
00:13:47,565 --> 00:13:49,999
He seems to hate you.
Are you sure?

212
00:13:50,244 --> 00:13:51,916
It's my cat. Give me my cat.

213
00:13:52,843 --> 00:13:54,481
Wait a minute. What's his name?

214
00:13:55,442 --> 00:13:56,431
Bob-- Buttons.

215
00:13:57,761 --> 00:13:58,671
Bob Buttons?

216
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,237
Bob Buttons.
Here, Bob Buttons.

217
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:05,679
You are a very bad man!

218
00:14:07,037 --> 00:14:08,675
You owe me a cat.

219
00:14:12,955 --> 00:14:14,673
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

220
00:14:16,913 --> 00:14:19,473
Where did you go,
little kitty, kitty?

221
00:14:36,105 --> 00:14:37,857
Come on, lucky sixes!

222
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:41,383
Everybody, this is Paolo.

223
00:14:41,903 --> 00:14:43,859
Paolo, I want you to meet my friends.

224
00:14:44,102 --> 00:14:45,899
This is Monica. . .

225
00:14:46,941 --> 00:14:48,454
. . .and Joey. . .

226
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,458
. . .and Ross.

227
00:14:58,656 --> 00:15:00,851
He doesn't speak much English.

228
00:15:02,055 --> 00:15:03,852
Monopoly!

229
00:15:05,253 --> 00:15:06,971
Look at that!

230
00:15:10,051 --> 00:15:11,484
Where did Paolo come from?

231
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:13,922
Italy, I think.

232
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:17,919
No, I mean tonight, in the building?
Suddenly into our lives?

233
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:23,167
The cat turned out to be
Paolo's cat. Isn't that funny?

234
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:28,042
That is funny. And Rachel
keeps touching him.

235
00:15:30,683 --> 00:15:34,642
I looked all over the building
and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.

236
00:15:34,881 --> 00:15:37,190
I found him.
It was Paolo's cat.

237
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,639
Well, there you go.
Last to know again.

238
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:44,830
And I'm guessing, since nobody
told me, this is Paolo?

239
00:15:45,597 --> 00:15:47,713
Paolo, this is Phoebe.

240
00:15:53,074 --> 00:15:54,268
You betcha!

241
00:15:57,872 --> 00:16:00,784
All right. Okay. What next?

242
00:16:01,231 --> 00:16:04,064
Blow a bubble. A bubble's good.

243
00:16:04,269 --> 00:16:06,863
It's got a boyish charm.
It's impish.

244
00:16:07,068 --> 00:16:08,421
Here we go.

245
00:16:19,503 --> 00:16:21,016
Nice going, imp!

246
00:16:21,782 --> 00:16:24,137
It's okay. All I need to do is...

247
00:16:24,341 --> 00:16:27,299
...reach over and put it
back in my mouth.

248
00:16:30,379 --> 00:16:33,849
Good save!
We're back on track and I'm...

249
00:16:34,457 --> 00:16:37,096
...chewing someone else's gum.

250
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:39,855
This is not my gum!

251
00:16:40,055 --> 00:16:41,852
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

252
00:16:42,774 --> 00:16:44,605
And now you're choking.

253
00:16:46,692 --> 00:16:47,522
You all right?

254
00:16:49,691 --> 00:16:51,409
Oh, my God!
You're choking!

255
00:16:56,368 --> 00:16:57,596
Better?

256
00:16:59,247 --> 00:17:00,999
Thank you. That was. . . .

257
00:17:01,606 --> 00:17:02,436
That was. . . .

258
00:17:03,206 --> 00:17:04,036
Perfection?

259
00:17:25,876 --> 00:17:27,594
What'd he say that was so funny?

260
00:17:27,836 --> 00:17:30,396
I have absolutely no idea.

261
00:17:30,834 --> 00:17:32,711
That's classic.

262
00:17:32,953 --> 00:17:34,830
My God, you guys!
What am I doing?

263
00:17:35,073 --> 00:17:36,825
This is so un-me!

264
00:17:37,072 --> 00:17:38,505
If you want, I'll do it.

265
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:43,304
I just wanna bite his bottom lip.

266
00:17:44,269 --> 00:17:45,588
But I won't.

267
00:17:46,788 --> 00:17:48,779
The first time he smiled at me. . .

268
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:52,940
. . .those seconds were more exciting
than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.

269
00:17:53,185 --> 00:17:54,504
Did you rent mopeds?

270
00:17:56,584 --> 00:17:57,983
Because I've heard--

271
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,733
Oh, it's not about that right now.

272
00:18:01,462 --> 00:18:04,772
I know it's totally superficial,
and we have nothing in common. . .

273
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,409
. . . .and we don't even speak
the same language. . .

274
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:09,052
. . .but God!

275
00:18:16,256 --> 00:18:17,575
Listen. . . .

276
00:18:21,214 --> 00:18:24,570
Listen, something you should know.

277
00:18:25,412 --> 00:18:27,801
Rachel and I are. . . .

278
00:18:28,051 --> 00:18:30,360
We're kind of a thing.

279
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:33,410
-Thing?
-Thing. Yes, thing.

280
00:18:33,769 --> 00:18:35,805
You have the sex?

281
00:18:38,607 --> 00:18:42,759
Technically, the sex is not being had.
But that's. . . .

282
00:18:43,445 --> 00:18:44,844
That's not the point.

283
00:18:45,604 --> 00:18:49,836
The point is that
Rachel and I should be. . . .

284
00:18:50,602 --> 00:18:53,162
Well, Rachel and I
should be together.

285
00:18:53,361 --> 00:18:55,158
And if you get in the. . . .

286
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,954
In bed?

287
00:18:59,318 --> 00:19:00,910
No, not where I was going.

288
00:19:01,118 --> 00:19:05,873
If you get in the way of us
becoming a thing. . .

289
00:19:06,116 --> 00:19:08,835
. . .then I would be, well, very sad.

290
00:19:10,834 --> 00:19:11,903
So do you. . .?

291
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:19,829
You do know a little English?

292
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:20,946
Little.

293
00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:23,665
Do you know the word crap-weasel?

294
00:19:26,028 --> 00:19:28,542
That's funny,
you are a huge crap-weasel.

295
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:37,095
Chandler, we've been here for an hour
doing this. Watch, it's easy.

296
00:19:37,303 --> 00:19:38,531
Ready?

297
00:19:42,621 --> 00:19:43,940
Now try it.

298
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,132
You gotta whip it.

299
00:19:52,377 --> 00:19:55,528
Look, look! The last candle's
about to burn out.

300
00:19:55,776 --> 00:19:59,769
1 0, 9, 8, 7. . .

301
00:20:00,014 --> 00:20:04,212
. . .minus 46, minus 47,
minus 48. . . .

302
00:20:05,332 --> 00:20:07,323
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

303
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:11,368
Kind of spooky without any lights.

304
00:20:18,566 --> 00:20:21,126
Okay, guys, I have the definitive one.

305
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,835
This isn't the best time
to bring it up. . .

306
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:39,513
. . .but you have to throw
a party for Monica.

307
00:20:48,274 --> 00:20:50,071
This has been fun.

308
00:20:50,314 --> 00:20:53,545
Yes. Thanks for letting me
use your phone. . .

309
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:55,749
. . .and for saving my life.

310
00:20:57,191 --> 00:20:58,624
Well, goodbye, Chandler.

311
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,781
I had a great blackout.

312
00:21:01,709 --> 00:21:02,903
See you.

313
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:23,498
I'm account number 7143457. And I don't
know if you got any of that. . .

314
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,090
. . .but I would really
like a copy of the tape.
