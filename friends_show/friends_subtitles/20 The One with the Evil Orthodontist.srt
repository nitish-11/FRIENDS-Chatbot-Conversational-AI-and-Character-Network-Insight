1
00:00:00,435 --> 00:00:03,188
I can't believe
you would actually say that.

2
00:00:03,432 --> 00:00:06,549
I would much rather be Mr. Peanut
than Mr. Salty.

3
00:00:06,909 --> 00:00:09,377
No way!
Mr. Salty is a sailor.

4
00:00:09,627 --> 00:00:12,300
He's gotta be, like,
the toughest snack there is.

5
00:00:13,783 --> 00:00:17,139
I don't know. You don't
wanna mess with corn nuts.

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,133
They're crazy!

7
00:00:21,217 --> 00:00:23,526
Oh, my God! You gotta come see this.

8
00:00:23,735 --> 00:00:26,533
There's some creep out there
with a telescope!

9
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,924
I can't believe it!
He's looking right at us!

10
00:00:31,128 --> 00:00:32,959
Oh, that is so sick!

11
00:00:33,206 --> 00:00:34,764
I feel violated.

12
00:00:35,005 --> 00:00:36,677
And not in a good way.

13
00:00:36,883 --> 00:00:38,396
How can people do that?

14
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:43,599
You guys, look!
Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!

15
00:00:46,395 --> 00:00:48,272
The One With the Evil Orthodontist

16
00:00:49,512 --> 00:00:50,501
English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

17
00:01:35,112 --> 00:01:38,309
I tell you, years from now,
school children will study it. . .

18
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:41,461
. . .as one of the greatest
first dates of all time.

19
00:01:42,146 --> 00:01:43,261
It was unbelievable.

20
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:46,462
We could be ourselves.
We didn't have to play games.

21
00:01:46,702 --> 00:01:47,498
Have you called her?

22
00:01:47,701 --> 00:01:50,056
Let her know I like her?
Are you insane?

23
00:01:50,698 --> 00:01:51,926
Guys! It's gross!

24
00:01:52,137 --> 00:01:54,571
It's the next day.
How needy do I wanna seem?

25
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:56,088
I'm right. Right?

26
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:57,846
Yeah, let her dangle.

27
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,044
I can't believe my parents
are pressuring me. . .

28
00:02:02,248 --> 00:02:03,761
. . .to find one of you people.

29
00:02:04,006 --> 00:02:06,440
God!
Come on. Just do it.

30
00:02:06,684 --> 00:02:09,915
Call her.
Stop being so testosterone-y.

31
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,040
Which, by the way,
is the real San Francisco treat.

32
00:02:19,313 --> 00:02:21,224
-I got her machine.
-Her answering machine?

33
00:02:21,511 --> 00:02:23,706
No, interestingly,
her leaf blower picked up.

34
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:29,256
So why didn't you say anything?

35
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:32,064
No. Last time I left
a spontaneous message. . .

36
00:02:32,301 --> 00:02:35,020
. . .I ended up using the phrase,
''Yes, indeed-io! ''

37
00:02:37,217 --> 00:02:40,209
Look, it's Rachel and Barry.
Don't everybody look at once.

38
00:02:40,854 --> 00:02:42,333
Okay! What's going on?

39
00:02:42,532 --> 00:02:43,760
They're just talking.

40
00:02:43,971 --> 00:02:45,450
Does he look upset?

41
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,124
Does he look like he was told
to shove anything?

42
00:02:50,645 --> 00:02:52,442
No. Actually, he's smiling.

43
00:02:52,684 --> 00:02:54,720
Oh, my God! Don't do that!

44
00:02:54,922 --> 00:02:55,832
What? What? What?

45
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,999
That man across the street
just kicked that pigeon.

46
00:03:01,676 --> 00:03:06,591
And basically, that's how
a bill becomes a law.

47
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,026
See?

48
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:10,384
Hey, Rach.

49
00:03:11,627 --> 00:03:12,776
How'd it go?

50
00:03:13,265 --> 00:03:16,780
You know, it was actually
really great.

51
00:03:17,222 --> 00:03:19,019
Took me to lunch
at the Russian Tea Room.

52
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,933
I had that chicken, where you poke it
and butter squirts out.

53
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,533
Not a good day for birds.

54
00:03:24,735 --> 00:03:26,407
Then we took a walk to Bendel's.

55
00:03:26,654 --> 00:03:30,169
And I told him not to, but he got me
a little bottle of Chanel.

56
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:31,880
That's nice.

57
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:34,563
Now was that before or after
you told him. . .

58
00:03:34,767 --> 00:03:38,077
. . .to stop calling, stop sending
flowers and to leave you alone?

59
00:03:39,442 --> 00:03:40,238
Right.

60
00:03:40,442 --> 00:03:43,115
Well, we never actually got to that.

61
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:46,192
It was just so nice to see him again,
you know?

62
00:03:46,396 --> 00:03:49,752
It was comfortable
and it was familiar.

63
00:03:50,193 --> 00:03:51,592
It was just nice.

64
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:53,549
That's nice twice.

65
00:03:55,029 --> 00:03:56,064
What's going on?

66
00:03:56,308 --> 00:03:58,742
Isn't this the same Barry who
you left at the altar?

67
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:00,504
Where have you been?

68
00:04:02,422 --> 00:04:04,253
But it was different
with him today.

69
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,139
He wasn't, like,
Orthodontist Guy, you know?

70
00:04:07,378 --> 00:04:10,973
I mean, we had fun!
Is there anything wrong with that?

71
00:04:14,012 --> 00:04:14,808
Why?

72
00:04:15,011 --> 00:04:16,729
I have my reasons.

73
00:04:19,127 --> 00:04:21,960
How about the fact that he's
engaged to another woman. . .

74
00:04:22,205 --> 00:04:24,514
. . .who happens to be
your ex-best friend?

75
00:04:24,962 --> 00:04:27,112
All right, all right!
I know it's stupid.

76
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,477
I'll go see him this afternoon
and I'll put an end to it.

77
00:04:37,391 --> 00:04:40,701
I'm not crazy, right?
I mean, it was never like that.

78
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:42,900
No, it wasn't!

79
00:04:46,543 --> 00:04:49,296
It was so nice
having this little sink here.

80
00:04:53,737 --> 00:04:56,695
''Oh, Danielle,
I wasn't expecting the machine.

81
00:04:58,653 --> 00:05:01,087
Give me a call
when you get a chance. ''

82
00:05:03,768 --> 00:05:04,883
Bye-bye.

83
00:05:05,766 --> 00:05:06,881
Oh, God!

84
00:05:08,924 --> 00:05:12,121
That's what you've been working on
for the past two hours?

85
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,550
I've been honing.

86
00:05:15,278 --> 00:05:16,393
What was with the dishes?

87
00:05:16,597 --> 00:05:19,475
I wanted her to think
I might be in a restaurant. . .

88
00:05:19,714 --> 00:05:23,673
. . .you know, I might have a life.
Like I haven't been sitting here. . .

89
00:05:23,871 --> 00:05:25,941
. . .honing for the last two hours?

90
00:05:26,268 --> 00:05:28,418
The guy with the telescope
is doing it again!

91
00:05:28,626 --> 00:05:30,264
Oh, my God!

92
00:05:31,943 --> 00:05:35,572
Go away!
Stop looking in here!

93
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,050
Great.
Now he's waving back.

94
00:05:39,537 --> 00:05:41,095
We gotta do something about him.

95
00:05:41,335 --> 00:05:43,530
I caught him looking
into our apartment.

96
00:05:43,733 --> 00:05:46,247
It creeps me out!
I feel like I can't do stuff.

97
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,842
What kind of stuff?

98
00:05:50,887 --> 00:05:53,640
Will you grow up?
I'm not talking about sexy stuff. . .

99
00:05:53,844 --> 00:05:56,358
. . .but, like,
when I'm cooking naked.

100
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,749
You cook naked?

101
00:05:59,999 --> 00:06:03,230
Yeah, toast, oatmeal.
Nothing that spatters.

102
00:06:06,393 --> 00:06:09,032
What are you looking at me for?
I didn't know that.

103
00:06:11,269 --> 00:06:12,622
What's the matter?

104
00:06:13,307 --> 00:06:15,821
I just--
Oh, Barry, this was not good.

105
00:06:16,025 --> 00:06:18,858
No, it was.
It was very, very good.

106
00:06:19,502 --> 00:06:20,651
What about Mindy?

107
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,452
Oh, way better than Mindy.

108
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:27,256
Not that! I mean,
what about you and Mindy?

109
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:30,652
Oh. If you want, I'll just
break it off with her.

110
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,599
No, don't do that.
Not for me.

111
00:06:34,848 --> 00:06:38,204
Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush
is here for his adjustment.

112
00:06:38,445 --> 00:06:39,321
Thanks, Bernice.

113
00:06:40,643 --> 00:06:42,395
Let's go away this weekend.

114
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:44,834
Come on.
This is all way too--

115
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,592
No, we can go to Aruba.

116
00:06:47,397 --> 00:06:50,389
When I went there on what
would've been our honeymoon. . .

117
00:06:50,594 --> 00:06:53,427
. . .it was really nice.
You would've liked it.

118
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,183
I had a bra.

119
00:07:08,538 --> 00:07:09,448
Hey, Dr. Farber.

120
00:07:09,658 --> 00:07:13,173
All right, Miss Greene,
everything looks fine.

121
00:07:13,574 --> 00:07:16,134
We're starting to see
some real progress here.

122
00:07:19,369 --> 00:07:20,165
What?

123
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,764
I'm 12, I'm not stupid.

124
00:07:32,637 --> 00:07:34,150
Can I use your phone?

125
00:07:34,835 --> 00:07:37,349
For future reference,
that thing in your hand. . .

126
00:07:37,553 --> 00:07:39,350
. . .can also be used as a phone.

127
00:07:43,228 --> 00:07:44,502
Yes, it's working.

128
00:07:46,745 --> 00:07:48,064
Why isn't she calling back?

129
00:07:48,623 --> 00:07:50,056
Maybe she never got your message.

130
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:53,538
You could call her machine,
and if she has a lot of beeps. . .

131
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:55,809
. . .that means she didn't get
her messages yet.

132
00:07:56,616 --> 00:07:57,935
Doesn't that make me seem--?

133
00:07:58,175 --> 00:08:00,211
Desperate? Needy?
Pathetic?

134
00:08:01,132 --> 00:08:03,521
You obviously saw my personal ad.

135
00:08:06,488 --> 00:08:07,284
How many beeps?

136
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,920
She answered.

137
00:08:10,684 --> 00:08:13,835
This is where you'd use
that ''hello'' word we talked about.

138
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,114
I won't talk to her.
She obviously got my message. . .

139
00:08:17,358 --> 00:08:20,589
. . .and is choosing not to call me.
Now I'm needy and snubbed.

140
00:08:21,994 --> 00:08:24,110
God, I miss just being needy!

141
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,143
So how'd he take it?

142
00:08:28,468 --> 00:08:30,698
Pretty well, actually.

143
00:08:33,544 --> 00:08:36,502
How come you have
dental floss in your hair?

144
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,133
Oh, do I?

145
00:08:41,816 --> 00:08:43,886
We ended up having sex in his chair.

146
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:46,292
You had sex in his chair?

147
00:08:50,928 --> 00:08:53,488
I said that a little
too loudly, didn't I?

148
00:08:54,765 --> 00:08:56,278
You had what?

149
00:08:57,563 --> 00:08:59,440
Sex in his chair.

150
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:02,635
What. . . .

151
00:09:03,318 --> 00:09:04,671
What were you thinking?

152
00:09:04,876 --> 00:09:07,834
I don't know.
We still care about each other.

153
00:09:08,353 --> 00:09:10,913
There's a history there.
It's like you and Carol.

154
00:09:13,668 --> 00:09:15,659
It's nothing like me and Carol.

155
00:09:15,867 --> 00:09:19,701
Please! If she said to you,
''Ross, I want you on this couch. . .

156
00:09:19,943 --> 00:09:22,059
. . .right here, right now,''
what would you say?

157
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:26,455
If it helps I could slide over.

158
00:09:28,695 --> 00:09:31,255
It's a totally different situation.

159
00:09:31,453 --> 00:09:34,570
It's apples and oranges.
It's orthodontists and lesbians--

160
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:35,606
I gotta go.

161
00:09:37,487 --> 00:09:39,637
-Where are you going?
-I just have to go!

162
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:43,042
Do I need a reason?
I have things to do with my life.

163
00:09:43,242 --> 00:09:45,437
I have a jam-packed schedule.

164
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,030
And I am late for keeping up
with it, okay?

165
00:10:02,466 --> 00:10:03,421
Mindy.

166
00:10:05,223 --> 00:10:06,815
How are you?

167
00:10:07,261 --> 00:10:11,049
Yes, I heard. Congratulations!
That is so great!

168
00:10:11,298 --> 00:10:13,209
Really, oh, God--

169
00:10:15,614 --> 00:10:16,933
I'm working tomorrow. . .

170
00:10:17,133 --> 00:10:20,409
. . .but if you want, you can come by
if you'd like.

171
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:23,203
Great!

172
00:10:26,884 --> 00:10:29,239
So I'll see you tomorrow.

173
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:31,237
Bye.

174
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,597
Oh, God! Oh, God!

175
00:10:37,075 --> 00:10:38,633
So how's Mindy?

176
00:10:40,192 --> 00:10:41,830
She wants to see me tomorrow.

177
00:10:42,071 --> 00:10:44,062
She sounded weird.
I gotta call Barry.

178
00:10:48,665 --> 00:10:50,223
It's me. I just--

179
00:10:50,423 --> 00:10:51,219
Mindy!

180
00:10:52,621 --> 00:10:53,610
Mindy!

181
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,932
No, I figured
that's where you'd be.

182
00:11:11,964 --> 00:11:14,603
Hell is filled
with people like you.

183
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,192
He's back.
The peeper's back.

184
00:11:20,357 --> 00:11:22,075
-Get down!
-Get down?

185
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,630
And boogie.

186
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:28,942
Thanks, but I gotta go and get
my eyes scratched out by Mindy.

187
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,702
Relax. She may not even know.

188
00:11:30,988 --> 00:11:34,185
I haven't heard from her
in seven months, and now she calls me.

189
00:11:34,465 --> 00:11:36,342
I mean, what else is it about?

190
00:11:36,543 --> 00:11:38,499
She was my best friend, you guys.

191
00:11:38,701 --> 00:11:40,339
We went to camp together. . .

192
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:42,336
. . .she taught me how to kiss. . . .

193
00:11:45,175 --> 00:11:47,973
Now, you know,
I'm, like, the other woman!

194
00:11:48,173 --> 00:11:49,322
I feel so--

195
00:11:49,571 --> 00:11:50,924
Naughty!

196
00:11:52,888 --> 00:11:55,356
-I'll see you guys later.
-I'll walk out with you.

197
00:11:55,606 --> 00:11:57,642
When she taught you to kiss,
you were at camp. . .

198
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,921
. . .and were you wearing
any kind of little uniform or--?

199
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,318
That's fine, yeah.

200
00:12:05,797 --> 00:12:08,231
I'm going to the bathroom.
Will you watch my phone?

201
00:12:08,475 --> 00:12:09,544
Why not take it with you?

202
00:12:10,473 --> 00:12:13,351
We haven't been on a second date.
She needs to hear me pee?

203
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,109
Why don't you just call her?

204
00:12:15,349 --> 00:12:18,341
I can't call her. I left a message.
I have some pride.

205
00:12:18,546 --> 00:12:19,422
-Do you?
-No!

206
00:12:26,539 --> 00:12:27,972
Danielle, hi!

207
00:12:28,177 --> 00:12:30,133
It's Chandler.

208
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,694
I'm fine.

209
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:34,129
Listen. . . .

210
00:12:34,332 --> 00:12:37,881
I don't know if you tried to call me
because, idiot that I am. . .

211
00:12:38,089 --> 00:12:40,284
. . .I accidentally shut off my phone.

212
00:12:43,564 --> 00:12:45,998
That's fine. That's great. Okay.

213
00:12:47,281 --> 00:12:49,875
She's on the other line.
She's gonna call me back.

214
00:12:50,877 --> 00:12:54,586
She's on the other line,
she's gonna call me back!

215
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,990
-Don't you have to pee?
-That's why I'm dancing.

216
00:13:02,187 --> 00:13:02,983
Mindy.

217
00:13:03,346 --> 00:13:04,301
Hey, you.

218
00:13:04,945 --> 00:13:05,741
Hey, you.

219
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,289
So what's up?

220
00:13:12,738 --> 00:13:14,569
We should really be sitting for this.

221
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,694
Sure we should.

222
00:13:26,046 --> 00:13:26,842
So. . . .

223
00:13:27,086 --> 00:13:29,646
Now, I know things have
been weird lately.

224
00:13:29,843 --> 00:13:32,801
But you're my oldest friend,
except for Laurie Schaefer. . .

225
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,274
. . .who I don't talk to anymore. . .

226
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:36,953
. . .because she's bitter
that she lost the weight. . .

227
00:13:37,157 --> 00:13:39,387
. . .and it turns out,
she doesn't have a pretty face.

228
00:13:41,753 --> 00:13:44,904
I'll just ask you this once,
and I want a straight answer.

229
00:13:48,507 --> 00:13:50,225
Will you be my maid of honor?

230
00:13:54,182 --> 00:13:55,058
Of course!

231
00:13:55,261 --> 00:13:56,057
That's so great!

232
00:13:56,899 --> 00:13:57,968
It is! It is!

233
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:01,413
-That's all you wanted to ask?
-That's all!

234
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:06,925
What?

235
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,126
That's not all.

236
00:14:09,688 --> 00:14:10,598
Oh, sure it is!

237
00:14:10,847 --> 00:14:12,599
Oh, no, it isn't!

238
00:14:14,244 --> 00:14:16,519
I think Barry's seeing someone
in the city.

239
00:14:18,201 --> 00:14:19,919
What would make you think that?

240
00:14:20,239 --> 00:14:23,037
Ever since we announced
the engagement, he's acted weird.

241
00:14:23,276 --> 00:14:26,666
And then last night, he came home
smelling like Chanel!

242
00:14:28,991 --> 00:14:29,787
Really?

243
00:14:31,869 --> 00:14:34,178
If it'll make you feel any better. . .

244
00:14:34,426 --> 00:14:37,702
. . .when Barry and I got engaged,
he went through a weird thing too.

245
00:14:37,903 --> 00:14:40,098
Oh, God!
That's what I was afraid of.

246
00:14:40,301 --> 00:14:42,815
What's what you were afraid of?

247
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:48,774
When Barry was engaged to you,
he and I. . .

248
00:14:48,974 --> 00:14:52,603
. . .kind of had
a little thing on the side.

249
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:54,286
What?

250
00:14:54,489 --> 00:14:55,558
I know, I know.

251
00:14:55,808 --> 00:14:57,958
When he proposed to me,
everyone said, ''Don't do it.

252
00:14:58,205 --> 00:14:59,957
He'll do to you
what he did to Rachel. ''

253
00:15:00,164 --> 00:15:01,836
And now I feel so stupid.

254
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:08,517
You are so stupid.

255
00:15:11,034 --> 00:15:12,945
We are both so stupid.

256
00:15:13,192 --> 00:15:14,341
What do you mean?

257
00:15:16,869 --> 00:15:18,143
Smell familiar?

258
00:15:21,425 --> 00:15:22,778
Oh, I'm so sorry.

259
00:15:23,343 --> 00:15:25,618
Oh, no, me.
I am so sorry.

260
00:15:25,821 --> 00:15:27,777
No, I am sorry.
I'm sorry.

261
00:15:41,328 --> 00:15:42,727
Oh, my!

262
00:15:44,964 --> 00:15:47,319
Four letters, ''circle or hoop. ''

263
00:15:47,562 --> 00:15:48,790
Ring, damn it, ring!

264
00:15:49,001 --> 00:15:50,320
Thanks.

265
00:15:53,317 --> 00:15:54,796
You know our phone's not working?

266
00:15:55,035 --> 00:15:56,309
What?

267
00:15:57,273 --> 00:15:58,945
I called from the coffee shop.

268
00:15:59,152 --> 00:16:01,905
-There was no answer.
-I turned it off.

269
00:16:02,109 --> 00:16:04,179
Mother of God, I turned it off!

270
00:16:04,827 --> 00:16:06,146
Just like you told her you did.

271
00:16:08,104 --> 00:16:09,583
Just pointing out the irony.

272
00:16:10,981 --> 00:16:13,620
I went across the street
and talked to the doorman.

273
00:16:13,979 --> 00:16:16,447
I got the peeper's name.
Can I use the phone?

274
00:16:18,775 --> 00:16:19,969
Can I use your phone?

275
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:26,530
The number for a Sidney Marks, please.

276
00:16:26,887 --> 00:16:28,366
''Heating device. ''

277
00:16:29,485 --> 00:16:30,520
Radiator.

278
00:16:30,764 --> 00:16:32,083
Five letters.

279
00:16:32,483 --> 00:16:33,882
''Rdtor. ''

280
00:16:38,477 --> 00:16:40,069
Yeah, is Sidney there?

281
00:16:41,315 --> 00:16:42,111
Oh, this is?

282
00:16:43,073 --> 00:16:43,983
Sidney's a woman.

283
00:16:44,192 --> 00:16:45,750
So she's a woman, so what?

284
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,102
Yeah, so what?

285
00:16:48,428 --> 00:16:52,307
I live across the street, and I know
all about you and your telescope.

286
00:16:52,665 --> 00:16:54,383
And I don't appreciate it, okay?

287
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:57,177
Yeah, I can see you right now.
Hello?

288
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,373
If I wanna walk around my apartment
in my underwear. . .

289
00:17:00,618 --> 00:17:02,256
. . .I shouldn't have to feel--

290
00:17:02,456 --> 00:17:03,286
Thank you.

291
00:17:06,013 --> 00:17:07,765
That's not really the point.

292
00:17:08,011 --> 00:17:09,490
The point is, that--

293
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:12,244
Mostly free-weights,
but occasionally--

294
00:17:14,526 --> 00:17:17,086
Yeah, my neighbor.
Yeah, the brunette.

295
00:17:18,522 --> 00:17:20,990
She said you looked pretty that day
in the green dress.

296
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,547
The green dress?

297
00:17:23,797 --> 00:17:24,593
Really?

298
00:17:24,797 --> 00:17:26,753
She said you looked like
Ingrid Bergman.

299
00:17:36,027 --> 00:17:37,824
-You got a second?
-Sure, sure.

300
00:17:38,025 --> 00:17:39,014
Come on. . .

301
00:17:39,584 --> 00:17:40,380
. . .in.

302
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,141
Hello, sweetheart.

303
00:17:42,981 --> 00:17:44,653
What you guys doing here?

304
00:17:44,899 --> 00:17:47,538
We are here to break up with you.

305
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:49,850
Both of you?

306
00:17:50,214 --> 00:17:54,127
We think you're a horrible human being,
and bad things should happen to you.

307
00:17:56,688 --> 00:17:58,724
I'm sorry.
God, I am so sorry!

308
00:17:58,966 --> 00:18:01,241
I'm an idiot! I was weak!
I couldn't help myself.

309
00:18:01,484 --> 00:18:04,362
Whatever I did, I only did
because I love you so much.

310
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,955
Which one of us
are you talking to there?

311
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:12,990
Mindy.

312
00:18:13,194 --> 00:18:15,708
Of course, Mindy!
It was always Mindy.

313
00:18:16,031 --> 00:18:18,261
Even when we were having sex
in that chair?

314
00:18:18,709 --> 00:18:21,940
I swear, whatever I was doing,
I was always thinking of you.

315
00:18:22,146 --> 00:18:23,818
Oh, please!

316
00:18:24,064 --> 00:18:27,374
During that second time, you couldn't
have picked her out of a lineup!

317
00:18:27,581 --> 00:18:28,491
You did it twice?

318
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,975
The first time didn't count.
You know, it was Barry.

319
00:18:32,217 --> 00:18:33,093
Oh, right.

320
00:18:34,215 --> 00:18:35,807
Honey, baby, sweetheart, look. . . .

321
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:37,811
Just give me another chance.

322
00:18:38,012 --> 00:18:40,890
We'll start all over again.
We'll go back to Aruba.

323
00:18:42,728 --> 00:18:43,956
What do you say?

324
00:18:44,247 --> 00:18:46,807
Dr. Farber, we've got
an emergency here.

325
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:49,604
Jason Castalano's choking
on his retainer.

326
00:18:49,842 --> 00:18:52,481
Oh, God!
I'll be right there, Bernice.

327
00:18:52,719 --> 00:18:54,755
Look, please don't go anywhere.

328
00:18:54,957 --> 00:18:56,754
I'll be right back.

329
00:18:58,314 --> 00:19:01,112
Okay, and we'll be here,
hating you!

330
00:19:01,951 --> 00:19:04,021
See how he was sweating
when he walked out?

331
00:19:05,108 --> 00:19:08,259
If I'm hogging the ball too much,
you jump right in there. . .

332
00:19:08,465 --> 00:19:11,025
. . .and take a couple of punches.
This feels great!

333
00:19:12,382 --> 00:19:14,896
I'm pretty sure
I'm still gonna marry him.

334
00:19:15,979 --> 00:19:18,049
What are you talking about?

335
00:19:18,297 --> 00:19:20,970
Mindy, the guy is the devil!

336
00:19:21,174 --> 00:19:23,165
He is Satan in a smock!

337
00:19:23,892 --> 00:19:25,689
Look, I know he's not perfect.

338
00:19:29,207 --> 00:19:31,516
But the truth is
at the end of the day. . .

339
00:19:31,725 --> 00:19:33,955
. . .I still really wanna be. . .

340
00:19:34,203 --> 00:19:37,320
. . .Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber. . .

341
00:19:37,999 --> 00:19:39,910
. . .D.D.S.

342
00:19:40,517 --> 00:19:41,711
Oh, God!

343
00:19:42,435 --> 00:19:45,632
I hope you can find some way
to be happy for me.

344
00:19:45,872 --> 00:19:48,181
And I hope you'll still be
my maid of honor.

345
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:52,301
And I hope Barry doesn't kill you
and eat you in Aruba.

346
00:19:59,341 --> 00:20:00,694
You okay?

347
00:20:03,257 --> 00:20:04,485
Really?

348
00:20:06,974 --> 00:20:09,408
Ever since I ran out on Barry
at the wedding. . .

349
00:20:09,652 --> 00:20:12,291
. . .I have wondered whether I made
the right choice.

350
00:20:13,248 --> 00:20:14,727
And now I know.

351
00:20:15,766 --> 00:20:17,279
I'm so glad.

352
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:22,879
Big day.

353
00:20:31,352 --> 00:20:34,583
All right, I'll give you this:
Mr. Peanut is a better dresser.

354
00:20:34,829 --> 00:20:37,662
I mean, he's got the monocle,
he's got the top hat. . . .

355
00:20:37,867 --> 00:20:39,459
Did you know he's gay?

356
00:20:42,702 --> 00:20:46,456
I just wanna clarify this.
Are you outing Mr. Peanut?

357
00:20:49,057 --> 00:20:50,456
Danielle, hi!

358
00:20:50,655 --> 00:20:53,692
Everybody, this is Danielle.
Danielle, everybody.

359
00:20:54,572 --> 00:20:55,561
Why are you here?

360
00:20:55,771 --> 00:20:58,763
I've been calling you, but it
turns out I had your number wrong.

361
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:02,080
And when I finally got the right one,
there was no answer.

362
00:21:02,325 --> 00:21:05,362
So I thought I'd come down here
and make sure you were okay.

363
00:21:06,921 --> 00:21:07,876
I'm okay.

364
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,634
Listen, maybe we
could get together later?

365
00:21:11,117 --> 00:21:13,995
That sounds good. I'll call you.
Or you call me, whatever.

366
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:16,623
You got it!

367
00:21:16,872 --> 00:21:17,702
Bye, everybody.

368
00:21:21,189 --> 00:21:22,065
There you go.

369
00:21:22,268 --> 00:21:23,986
Second date!

370
00:21:24,186 --> 00:21:25,414
I don't know.

371
00:21:26,024 --> 00:21:27,093
You don't know?

372
00:21:27,303 --> 00:21:30,739
She seems nice, but that thing about
her coming all the way here. . .

373
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:34,290
. . .just to see if I was okay?
I mean, how needy is that?
