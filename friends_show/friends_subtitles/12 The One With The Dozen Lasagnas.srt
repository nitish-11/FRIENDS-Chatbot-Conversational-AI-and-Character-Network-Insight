1
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,949
No, no, we're done!

2
00:00:58,478 --> 00:00:59,672
The One With the Dozen Lasagnas

4
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,295
Aunt Silv, stop yelling!

5
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:48,258
If you'd told me
vegetarian lasagna. . .

6
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:50,847
. . .I would've made
vegetarian lasagna.

7
00:01:52,297 --> 00:01:54,049
The meat's only every third layer.

8
00:01:54,296 --> 00:01:55,854
Maybe you could scrape.

9
00:01:56,695 --> 00:01:59,573
Ross, did you really read
all these baby books?

10
00:01:59,774 --> 00:02:03,687
You could plunk me down in
any woman's uterus, no compass. . .

11
00:02:04,532 --> 00:02:06,488
. . .and I could find my way
out like that!

12
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:08,965
This is cool.

13
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,566
It says in some parts of the world
people eat the placenta.

14
00:02:15,047 --> 00:02:17,038
And we're done with the yogurt.

15
00:02:18,966 --> 00:02:19,762
Sorry.

16
00:02:20,445 --> 00:02:23,676
Aunt Silv, I did this as a favor.
I am not a caterer.

17
00:02:23,924 --> 00:02:26,518
What do you want me to do
with a dozen lasagnas?

18
00:02:27,882 --> 00:02:30,032
Nice talk, Aunt Silv.

19
00:02:30,601 --> 00:02:32,353
You kiss Uncle Freddie
with that mouth?

20
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,473
Ross, listen.

21
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:38,552
Do you know that right now
your baby is only this big?

22
00:02:38,798 --> 00:02:40,914
This is your baby.
''Hi, Daddy. ''

23
00:02:41,597 --> 00:02:42,393
Hello.

24
00:02:43,156 --> 00:02:44,669
''How come you don't live with Mommy?''

25
00:02:47,194 --> 00:02:49,105
''How come Mommy lives
with that other lady?''

26
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,309
''What's a lesbian?''

27
00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:04,427
Honey, you can say it.
It's Poconos. Poconos.

28
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:08,057
It's like ''poke a nose. ''

29
00:03:09,905 --> 00:03:12,817
Poke a nose.

30
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,420
So did I hear ''Poconos''?

31
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,890
My sister's giving us her place
for the weekend.

32
00:03:27,178 --> 00:03:28,406
First weekend away together.

33
00:03:28,618 --> 00:03:30,848
-Yeah, it's a big step.
-I know.

34
00:03:31,856 --> 00:03:33,289
It's just a weekend.
Big deal.

35
00:03:33,496 --> 00:03:36,056
Wasn't this supposed to be
just a fling?

36
00:03:36,295 --> 00:03:37,808
Shouldn't it be. . .

37
00:03:38,374 --> 00:03:39,807
. . .flung by now?

38
00:03:40,693 --> 00:03:42,445
We are way past the ''fling'' thing.

39
00:03:42,692 --> 00:03:46,401
I'm feeling things I've only
read about in Danielle Steel books.

40
00:03:46,651 --> 00:03:49,609
When I'm with him,
I'm just totally, totally. . . .

41
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:52,409
Nauseous.
I'm physically nauseous.

42
00:03:53,448 --> 00:03:56,804
What am I supposed to do?
Call Immigration?

43
00:03:57,646 --> 00:03:59,364
I could call Immigration.

44
00:04:05,603 --> 00:04:09,039
I love babies with
their little baby shoes. . .

45
00:04:09,241 --> 00:04:13,075
. . .and their little baby toes
and their little hands. . . .

46
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,390
You're gonna have to stop that. . .

47
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,475
. . .forever.

48
00:04:26,355 --> 00:04:27,788
Need a new table.

49
00:04:28,474 --> 00:04:29,589
You think?

50
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,945
-Come on in.
-Hello.

51
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:40,304
I brought the books. . .

52
00:04:40,829 --> 00:04:43,184
. . .and Monica sends her love
along with this lasagna.

53
00:04:43,668 --> 00:04:44,783
Great!

54
00:04:45,227 --> 00:04:48,185
Is it vegetarian?
Because Susan doesn't eat meat.

55
00:04:50,225 --> 00:04:52,375
I'm pretty sure that it is.

56
00:04:54,303 --> 00:04:57,056
So I got the results
of the amnio today.

57
00:04:57,262 --> 00:04:58,490
Tell me.
Is everything. . .?

58
00:04:58,702 --> 00:05:00,055
Totally and completely healthy.

59
00:05:00,261 --> 00:05:02,570
That's great! That is great!

60
00:05:07,778 --> 00:05:10,372
When did you and Susan
meet Huey Lewis?

61
00:05:10,617 --> 00:05:12,573
That's our friend Tanya.

62
00:05:21,812 --> 00:05:23,962
Of course, it's your friend Tanya.

63
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,643
Don't you wanna know
about the sex?

64
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:29,644
The sex?

65
00:05:31,728 --> 00:05:35,164
I'm having enough trouble with
the image of you and Susan together.

66
00:05:35,407 --> 00:05:37,682
But when you throw in Tanya. . . .

67
00:05:40,405 --> 00:05:42,361
The sex of the baby, Ross.

68
00:05:44,843 --> 00:05:45,912
You know it?

69
00:05:48,202 --> 00:05:49,760
Do you want to know?

70
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:52,151
I don't want to know.
Absolutely not.

71
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,073
I think you shouldn't know until
you look down there. . .

72
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:57,150
. . .and see,
''Oh, there it is. . . ''

73
00:05:57,838 --> 00:05:59,157
. . .or isn't.

74
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:04,146
-Hello, Ross.
-Susan.

75
00:06:04,395 --> 00:06:05,191
So?

76
00:06:06,034 --> 00:06:07,228
So did you hear?

77
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:09,425
Yes, we did.
Everything's A-OK.

78
00:06:09,633 --> 00:06:12,101
Oh, that's so cool!

79
00:06:13,391 --> 00:06:14,665
It really is.

80
00:06:15,191 --> 00:06:16,146
Do we know?

81
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:19,143
We certainly do.
It's going to be a--

82
00:06:19,549 --> 00:06:20,379
Hello?

83
00:06:20,788 --> 00:06:23,222
A guy who doesn't wanna know
is standing here.

84
00:06:25,187 --> 00:06:28,179
Well, is it what
we thought it would be?

85
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,096
What. . .?

86
00:06:36,542 --> 00:06:37,770
What did we think it'd be?

87
00:06:39,341 --> 00:06:41,536
I don't want to know.
Don't want to know.

88
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,577
I should probably just go.

89
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:46,135
-Well, thanks for the books.
-No problem.

90
00:06:50,497 --> 00:06:51,612
Susan.

91
00:06:56,814 --> 00:07:01,046
Who should we call first?
Your folks or Deb and Rhona?

92
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,925
Never mind.
I don 't wanna know.

93
00:07:11,368 --> 00:07:14,360
So just because it was my table,
I have to buy a new one?

94
00:07:14,607 --> 00:07:15,403
That's the rule.

95
00:07:17,206 --> 00:07:18,958
What rule?
There's no rule.

96
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:20,604
If anything, you owe me a table.

97
00:07:20,964 --> 00:07:21,760
How did you get that?

98
00:07:21,964 --> 00:07:23,841
This piece of furniture
was fine. . .

99
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:26,762
. . .until your breakfast adventure
with Angela Delveccio.

100
00:07:27,602 --> 00:07:28,637
You knew about that?

101
00:07:28,841 --> 00:07:32,277
The impressions you made in the butter
left little to the imagination.

102
00:07:33,799 --> 00:07:35,517
How about if we split it?

103
00:07:36,558 --> 00:07:38,469
What do you mean,
like, buy it together?

104
00:07:39,957 --> 00:07:41,515
Do you think we're ready for that?

105
00:07:42,915 --> 00:07:43,711
Why not?

106
00:07:43,955 --> 00:07:46,913
It's a big commitment.
What if one of us wants to move out?

107
00:07:47,993 --> 00:07:49,949
-Are you moving out?
-I'm not moving out.

108
00:07:50,193 --> 00:07:51,467
You'd tell me if you were?

109
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:56,868
-It's just, with my last roommate--
-I know all about Kip.

110
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:00,107
We bought a hibachi together,
then he ran off and got married. . .

111
00:08:00,308 --> 00:08:01,184
. . .and things got ugly.

112
00:08:02,188 --> 00:08:04,099
Let me ask you something.

113
00:08:04,387 --> 00:08:05,866
Was Kip a better roommate than me?

114
00:08:06,866 --> 00:08:07,662
Don't do that.

115
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,460
You've got a couple changes
in your schedule.

116
00:08:16,782 --> 00:08:19,819
Your 4:00 herbal massage
has been pushed back to 4:30.

117
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,938
And Ms. Summerfield
canceled her 5:30 shiatsu.

118
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:24,288
Thanks.

119
00:08:25,178 --> 00:08:26,452
Here comes your 3:00.

120
00:08:26,658 --> 00:08:29,331
I don't mean to sound
unprofessional, but-- Yum!

121
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:37,094
Paolo! Hi!
What are you doing here?

122
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:42,409
Rachella tell me you. . .

123
00:08:43,131 --> 00:08:43,961
. . .massage?

124
00:08:44,531 --> 00:08:46,726
Well, Rachella's right.

125
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:54,758
I don't know what you said,
so let's start.

126
00:08:57,325 --> 00:08:58,360
I am. . .

127
00:08:59,365 --> 00:09:01,242
. . .being naked?

128
00:09:01,524 --> 00:09:02,752
That's your decision.

129
00:09:02,963 --> 00:09:05,158
Some people prefer to take off--

130
00:09:07,162 --> 00:09:08,311
Being naked!

131
00:09:09,641 --> 00:09:12,713
I can't believe you don't want to know.
I couldn't not know.

132
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,429
If the doctor knows,
and Carol knows, and Susan knows--

133
00:09:16,678 --> 00:09:17,508
And Monica knows.

134
00:09:19,557 --> 00:09:20,876
How could you?
I don't even know.

135
00:09:21,116 --> 00:09:22,913
Carol called to thank me
for the lasagna.

136
00:09:23,155 --> 00:09:24,668
I asked. She told me.

137
00:09:24,954 --> 00:09:26,387
So what's it going to be?

138
00:09:29,513 --> 00:09:31,231
Great! Now he knows
and I don't know.

139
00:09:31,432 --> 00:09:33,662
I'm sorry. I'm excited
about being an aunt.

140
00:09:33,911 --> 00:09:35,060
Or an uncle.

141
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:43,463
Fine!

142
00:09:46,746 --> 00:09:47,576
What's the matter?

143
00:09:47,785 --> 00:09:50,663
Nothing! I'm sorry.
I'm just, I'm out of sorts.

144
00:09:50,904 --> 00:09:52,895
Can we get some
cappuccino over here?

145
00:09:54,463 --> 00:09:56,055
Oh, right! That's me!

146
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:00,499
That table place closes at 7. Come on.

147
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,855
Fine.

148
00:10:03,619 --> 00:10:04,654
What is it?

149
00:10:06,298 --> 00:10:07,174
You know Paolo?

150
00:10:07,377 --> 00:10:09,686
I'm familiar with his work.

151
00:10:10,976 --> 00:10:12,170
He made a move on me.

152
00:10:12,935 --> 00:10:15,324
-The store'll be open tomorrow.
-More coffee.

153
00:10:22,691 --> 00:10:23,965
What happened?

154
00:10:24,211 --> 00:10:25,883
He came in for a massage. . .

155
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:28,041
...and everything was fine until....

156
00:10:32,247 --> 00:10:33,043
My God!

157
00:10:33,287 --> 00:10:34,356
Are you sure?

158
00:10:35,486 --> 00:10:36,635
Oh, yeah. I'm sure.

159
00:10:41,324 --> 00:10:45,033
And all of a sudden, his hands
weren't the problem anymore.

160
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:49,877
Was it. . .?

161
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,634
Boy Scouts could've
camped under there.

162
00:10:54,678 --> 00:10:56,157
''Ooh,'' what?

163
00:10:56,398 --> 00:10:57,433
--ma Thurman.

164
00:10:57,637 --> 00:10:59,628
-The actress!
-Uma Thurman!

165
00:11:00,996 --> 00:11:01,792
Thanks, Rach.

166
00:11:04,874 --> 00:11:06,592
-What'll you do?
-You have to tell her.

167
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,222
You have to! It's your
moral obligation as a friend. . .

168
00:11:09,472 --> 00:11:11,064
. . .as a woman.
It's a feminist issue.

169
00:11:11,312 --> 00:11:12,825
Guys? Guys?

170
00:11:13,071 --> 00:11:14,743
You have to tell her.

171
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,309
Feminist issue?
That's where I went.

172
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:19,463
She is gonna hate me!

173
00:11:28,305 --> 00:11:30,261
Will you pick one?
Just pick one.

174
00:11:30,504 --> 00:11:31,778
Here, how about that one?

175
00:11:32,503 --> 00:11:34,414
That's patio furniture.

176
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:35,698
So what?

177
00:11:35,902 --> 00:11:39,178
Like people will come in and think,
''Uh-oh, I'm outside again. ''

178
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,415
Fine.

179
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,618
What about the birds?

180
00:11:43,978 --> 00:11:45,457
I don't know.
Birds just don't say. . .

181
00:11:45,698 --> 00:11:48,337
. . . ''Hello, sit here. Eat something. ''

182
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,809
You pick one.

183
00:11:51,056 --> 00:11:52,330
How about the ladybugs?

184
00:11:52,575 --> 00:11:56,534
So forget about the birds, but
big red insects suggest fine dining?

185
00:11:56,733 --> 00:11:58,883
Fine! Do you want the birds?
Get the birds!

186
00:11:59,092 --> 00:12:00,810
Not like that, I won't.

187
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:05,238
Kip would've liked the birds.

188
00:12:16,565 --> 00:12:17,441
Hi, Pheebs.

189
00:12:17,885 --> 00:12:18,795
Are you moving out?

190
00:12:19,044 --> 00:12:21,000
No, these aren't all
of my suitcases.

191
00:12:21,243 --> 00:12:22,596
This one's Paolo's.

192
00:12:26,241 --> 00:12:27,993
Rachel, can we talk for a sec?

193
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,076
Sure.

194
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,589
Just for a sec, because Paolo's
on his way over.

195
00:12:44,354 --> 00:12:47,505
We haven't known each other
for that long a time.

196
00:12:47,713 --> 00:12:49,669
There are three things
you should know about me.

197
00:12:50,192 --> 00:12:53,104
One, my friends are the most
important thing in my life.

198
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,188
Two, I never lie.

199
00:12:56,989 --> 00:13:00,504
And three, I make the best
oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.

200
00:13:05,026 --> 00:13:05,902
Thanks, Pheebs.

201
00:13:10,943 --> 00:13:12,456
My God!

202
00:13:13,662 --> 00:13:15,698
Why have I never tasted these before?

203
00:13:15,901 --> 00:13:19,610
I don't make them a lot, because
it's not fair to the other cookies.

204
00:13:26,457 --> 00:13:29,415
You're right. These are
the best oatmeal raisin cookies.

205
00:13:29,616 --> 00:13:31,095
Which proves that I never lie.

206
00:13:31,295 --> 00:13:33,013
I guess you don't.

207
00:13:33,534 --> 00:13:34,853
Paolo made a pass at me.

208
00:13:38,053 --> 00:13:39,372
So what do you think?

209
00:13:39,772 --> 00:13:41,967
It's the most beautiful table
I've ever seen.

210
00:13:42,211 --> 00:13:43,041
I know.

211
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:46,408
So will you balance the plates
on these little heads?

212
00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:48,128
Who cares?
We'll eat at the sink.

213
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,124
Come on!

214
00:13:51,447 --> 00:13:52,402
Heads up, Ross.

215
00:13:53,046 --> 00:13:53,876
Score!

216
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:55,275
You suck!

217
00:13:58,324 --> 00:13:59,552
Are you okay?

218
00:14:02,603 --> 00:14:03,752
I need some milk.

219
00:14:06,121 --> 00:14:07,395
I've got milk.

220
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:13,555
Here you go.

221
00:14:21,835 --> 00:14:22,631
Better?

222
00:14:28,312 --> 00:14:30,746
I feel so stupid!

223
00:14:31,431 --> 00:14:33,387
I think about the other day
with you guys.

224
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:36,986
And I was all,
''Oh, Paolo! He's so great!

225
00:14:37,229 --> 00:14:38,742
He makes me feel so--''

226
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:40,743
God!

227
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:42,860
I'm so embarrassed!

228
00:14:43,066 --> 00:14:44,784
I'm so embarrassed.

229
00:14:45,026 --> 00:14:46,300
I'm the one he hit on.

230
00:14:46,505 --> 00:14:48,063
Phoebe, I pushed him on you.

231
00:14:48,264 --> 00:14:49,982
If I had never met him,
this would never--

232
00:14:50,184 --> 00:14:52,220
-I'm so sorry.
-No, I'm sorry.

233
00:14:53,942 --> 00:14:54,852
Wait!

234
00:14:55,221 --> 00:14:57,337
-What are we sorry about?
-I don't know.

235
00:14:57,581 --> 00:14:59,492
Right. He's the pig.

236
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,339
-Such a pig!
-Oh, God, he's such a pig!

237
00:15:02,539 --> 00:15:05,849
He's like a big disgusting pig. . . .

238
00:15:06,097 --> 00:15:08,292
-Pig man!
-Yes, good!

239
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,854
But he was my pig man!

240
00:15:16,493 --> 00:15:18,563
How did I not see this?

241
00:15:20,051 --> 00:15:21,166
Oh, I know!

242
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:25,404
Because. . .

243
00:15:26,129 --> 00:15:27,562
. . .he's gorgeous.

244
00:15:27,808 --> 00:15:29,321
And he's charming.

245
00:15:29,568 --> 00:15:32,036
And the way he looks at you--

246
00:15:32,247 --> 00:15:33,157
The end.

247
00:15:36,005 --> 00:15:36,915
God!

248
00:15:38,964 --> 00:15:40,920
Should I not have told you?

249
00:15:41,683 --> 00:15:44,880
Trust me, it's much better
that I know.

250
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,794
But I just liked it better before.
It was better.

251
00:16:07,872 --> 00:16:09,066
I think she took it pretty well.

252
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:11,662
Paolo's over there right now, so. . . .

253
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:13,702
We should go
and see if she's okay.

254
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:16,100
Just one second.

255
00:16:17,428 --> 00:16:18,224
Score!

256
00:16:18,428 --> 00:16:19,781
Game! Us!

257
00:16:21,827 --> 00:16:22,737
Come on.

258
00:16:25,745 --> 00:16:27,383
It looks like
we kicked your butts.

259
00:16:27,584 --> 00:16:28,539
She kicked our butts.

260
00:16:28,784 --> 00:16:31,457
You could be on the Olympic
''Standing There'' team.

261
00:16:31,863 --> 00:16:32,978
Come on. Two on one.

262
00:16:33,262 --> 00:16:35,696
Why are you still here?
She just broke up with him.

263
00:16:35,901 --> 00:16:37,254
It's time for you to swoop in.

264
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,496
What, now?

265
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:41,728
Now is when you swoop.

266
00:16:41,979 --> 00:16:45,289
When Paolo walks out of there,
you gotta be the first guy she sees.

267
00:16:45,737 --> 00:16:47,887
She's got to know
you're everything he's not.

268
00:16:48,136 --> 00:16:50,092
You're like the anti-Paolo.

269
00:16:51,974 --> 00:16:53,646
My Catholic friend is right.

270
00:16:54,254 --> 00:16:56,085
She's distraught.
You're there for her.

271
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:59,325
You pick up the pieces, and then
you usher in. . .

272
00:16:59,571 --> 00:17:02,290
. . . ''The Age of Ross. ''

273
00:17:09,967 --> 00:17:11,400
Hold it! Ascolta!

274
00:17:14,445 --> 00:17:16,242
-How's it going?
-Don't stare.

275
00:17:16,445 --> 00:17:18,800
She finished throwing
his clothes off the balcony.

276
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:21,120
Now there's just
gesturing and arm-waving.

277
00:17:21,403 --> 00:17:24,839
That is either, ''How could you?''
or ''Enormous breasts! ''

278
00:17:26,721 --> 00:17:27,517
Here he comes.

279
00:17:38,436 --> 00:17:39,664
I am. . .

280
00:17:40,355 --> 00:17:41,674
. . .to say goodbye.

281
00:17:42,514 --> 00:17:43,663
Okay, bye-bye.

282
00:17:48,552 --> 00:17:50,144
I hate you
for what you did to Rachel.

283
00:17:50,351 --> 00:17:52,069
But I still have five of these. . .

284
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,699
. . .so heat it at 375
untiI the cheese bubbles.

285
00:17:59,547 --> 00:18:00,866
I just wanna tell you. . .

286
00:18:01,107 --> 00:18:04,497
. . .and I think I'd speak
for everyone when I say. . . .

287
00:18:11,143 --> 00:18:12,462
Just look at her.

288
00:18:12,702 --> 00:18:15,455
Guys, I think only one of us
should go out there. . .

289
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:17,492
-. . .so she's not overwhelmed.
-Right.

290
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,656
And I really think it should be me.

291
00:18:35,813 --> 00:18:36,609
You all right?

292
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:40,849
I've been better.

293
00:18:44,689 --> 00:18:45,758
Come here.

294
00:18:52,806 --> 00:18:53,602
Listen. . .

295
00:18:54,325 --> 00:18:57,237
. . .you deserve
so much better than him.

296
00:18:57,484 --> 00:18:58,360
I mean, you. . .

297
00:18:59,843 --> 00:19:03,233
. . .you should be with a guy who knows
what he has when he has you.

298
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,076
What?

299
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:11,633
I'm so sick of guys!

300
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,354
I don't want to look
at another guy.

301
00:19:14,597 --> 00:19:16,633
I don't want to think
about another guy.

302
00:19:16,876 --> 00:19:19,834
I don't even want
to be near another guy.

303
00:19:27,112 --> 00:19:29,023
Ross, you're so great.

304
00:19:40,507 --> 00:19:41,906
-Are you all right?
-Are you okay?

305
00:19:42,706 --> 00:19:44,025
Medium.

306
00:19:44,465 --> 00:19:46,217
Any cookies left?

307
00:19:49,383 --> 00:19:50,418
See, Rach. . .

308
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:54,901
. . .I don't think swearing off guys
altogether is the answer.

309
00:19:55,101 --> 00:19:59,572
What you need is to develop a more
sophisticated screening process.

310
00:20:01,058 --> 00:20:03,618
I just need to be
by myself for a while.

311
00:20:03,857 --> 00:20:05,529
I just gotta
figure out what I want.

312
00:20:08,096 --> 00:20:12,089
See, because not all guys out there
are gonna be a Paolo.

313
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,012
No, I know. I know.

314
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:18,001
And I'm sure your little boy's
not gonna grow up to be one.

315
00:20:18,811 --> 00:20:19,607
What?

316
00:20:19,891 --> 00:20:20,687
What?

317
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:24,918
I'm having a boy?

318
00:20:28,607 --> 00:20:31,440
No. In fact,
you're not having a boy.

319
00:20:31,846 --> 00:20:33,598
I'm having a boy.

320
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,114
Am I having a boy?

321
00:20:36,884 --> 00:20:38,795
You're having a boy!

322
00:20:39,243 --> 00:20:40,437
I'm having a boy!

323
00:20:40,682 --> 00:20:41,637
I'm having a boy!

324
00:20:41,842 --> 00:20:42,638
-What?
-What is it?

325
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:43,877
I'm having a boy!

326
00:20:48,879 --> 00:20:50,437
We already knew that!

327
00:20:53,757 --> 00:20:55,190
I'm having a son.

328
00:21:04,473 --> 00:21:06,111
And that would be a shutdown!

329
00:21:06,312 --> 00:21:07,506
Shutout!

330
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,264
Where you guys going?
Come on, one more game!

331
00:21:13,469 --> 00:21:15,380
It's 2:30 in the morning.

332
00:21:15,628 --> 00:21:16,583
Get out!

333
00:21:16,988 --> 00:21:19,821
You guys are always hanging out
in my apartment.

334
00:21:20,067 --> 00:21:22,422
Come on, I'll only use
my left hand.

335
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,622
Come on, wussies!

336
00:21:28,263 --> 00:21:30,379
All right! Okay!
I gotta go!

337
00:21:30,862 --> 00:21:31,977
I'm going.

338
00:21:32,422 --> 00:21:33,775
And I'm gone.

339
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,376
One more game?
