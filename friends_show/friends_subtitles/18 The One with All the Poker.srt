1
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,791
Rach, we're running low on résumés.

2
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,590
Do you want a job
with Popular Mechanics?

3
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,276
If you must work for mechanics,
those are the ones to work for.

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,310
Look, you guys.
I'm going for anything here.

5
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,551
I can't be a waitress anymore.
I mean it.

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,072
I'm sick of the lousy tips.
I'm sick of being called ''Excuse Me. ''

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,076
Rach, did you proofread these?

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,036
Why?

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,477
Nothing. I'm sure they'll be
impressed with your ''compuper'' skills!

10
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,558
Oh, my God!

11
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,676
Do you think it's on all of them?

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,877
No, I'm sure the Xerox machine
caught a few!

13
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,919
The One With the Poker

14
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,149
English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

15
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,755
Hey, guys.

16
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,634
Hi, ladies.

17
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,237
Can I get you anything?

18
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,476
-Did you bring the mail?
-Lots of responses.

19
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,678
Really? Sure we have scones left!

20
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,275
Read them to me.

21
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,832
''Dear Miss Greene: Thank you
for your inquiry. However. . . . ''

22
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,473
-We have apple cinnamon--
-''Dear Miss Greene'' . . . .

23
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,158
Your VISA bill is huge!

24
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,556
Give me that.

25
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,712
I can't believe you.
Linda's great.

26
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,871
-Why won't you date her?
-I don't know.

27
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,348
Is this still about her. . .

28
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,279
. . . ''The Flintstones could
have really happened'' thing?

29
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,675
It's not just that.

30
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,519
It's just, I want someone
who does something for me. . .

31
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,557
. . .who gets my heart pounding. . .

32
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,471
. . .who makes me. . . .

33
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,674
Little play things with yarn?

34
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,115
What?

35
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,710
Could you want her more?

36
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,356
Who?

37
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,030
Who? Dee, the sarcastic sister
from What's Happening!

38
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,836
Who?

39
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,595
Look, I am totally, totally over her.

40
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,273
-I just--
-Coffee?

41
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,875
No, we're fine.
We're fine.

42
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,836
Shut up!

43
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,996
We're not saying anything.

44
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,355
What?

45
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,471
Joey cried last night.

46
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,154
Thank you.

47
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,154
We were playing poker.

48
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,158
There was chocolate on the 3.
It looked like an 8.

49
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,918
God, you should've seen him.
''Read them and weep! ''

50
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,718
And then he did.

51
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,675
Now, how come you guys
have never played poker with us?

52
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,879
What is that? Some guy thing?
Like some kind of sexist guy thing?

53
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,799
Like it's poker,
so only guys can play?

54
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,519
Women are welcome to play.

55
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,719
Then what is it? Some kind of, like,
some kind of, you know. . . .

56
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,359
All right, what is it?

57
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,350
There just aren't
any women in our game.

58
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,235
We just don't happen to know any
women that know how to play poker.

59
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,228
Please! That is such a lame excuse.
It's a typical guy response.

60
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,759
Do you know how to play?

61
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,554
No.

62
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,468
But you could teach us.

63
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,073
No.

64
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,269
Okay, so now we draw cards.

65
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,115
I wouldn't need any,
because I have a straight.

66
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,675
-Oh, good for you!
-Congratulations!

67
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,198
Pheebs, how many do you want?

68
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,271
I just need two. The 1 0 of spades
and the 6 of clubs.

69
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,473
Pheebs, you can't do that.

70
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,438
I've got the 1 0 of spades. Here.

71
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,550
Thanks.

72
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,478
See, you can't do that.

73
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,915
I don't need them.
I'm going for 4s.

74
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,189
Oh, you're. . . .

75
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,790
Here we go.

76
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,077
We've got salmon roulettes
and assorted crudités.

77
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,914
What are you doing?

78
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,869
This is a poker game. You can't serve
food with more than one syllable.

79
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,312
It's got to be like chips
or dip or pretz--

80
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,154
At this point, the dealer--

81
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,955
We got it. Let's play for real.
High stakes! Big bucks!

82
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,515
You sure? Phoebe
just threw away two jacks. . .

83
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,512
. . .because they didn't look happy.

84
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,272
But I'm ready. So just deal.

85
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,478
Everybody, last minute
lesson! Joey. . . .

86
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,874
Three. . .

87
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,990
. . .eight!

88
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,556
Eight, three. All right!

89
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,436
Damn it, damn it, damn it!

90
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,070
I see. So then you were lying.

91
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,475
-About what?
-About how good your cards were.

92
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,309
I was bluffing.

93
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,390
And what is ''bluffing''?

94
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,277
Is it not another word for lying?

95
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,637
Sorry to break up this party. . .

96
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,638
. . .but I've got résumés to fax
before work tomorrow.

97
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,319
Rach, we've got to settle.

98
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,834
Settle what?

99
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,069
The Jamestown colony of Virginia.

100
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,679
You see, King George
is giving us the land, so. . . .

101
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,558
The game, Rachel.
You owe us money for the game.

102
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,556
Oh, right!

103
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,236
Guys, it's their first time.
Why don't we forget about the money?

104
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,715
Hell, no! We'll pay.

105
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,475
Okay, Monica, I had
another answer all ready.

106
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,675
And you know what?

107
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,474
-We want a rematch.
-That's fine with me.

108
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,079
Could use the money.

109
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,559
So you get your ya-yas
by taking money from your friends.

110
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,754
And I get my ya-yas from Ikea.

111
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,957
You have to put them together
yourself, but they cost less.

112
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,879
Look, Rachel, this is poker.
I play to win.

113
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,475
In order for me to win,
others have to lose.

114
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,116
If you're gonna play poker with me,
don't expect me to be nice.

115
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,272
Because once those cards
are dealt. . . .

116
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,676
I'm not a nice guy.

117
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,672
All right, boys. Let's eat.

118
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,270
Did you get that from
the ''I Love Rachel'' pizzeria?

119
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,910
Are you still on that?

120
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,680
Come on. What was with that
Black Bart speech?

121
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,071
''When I play poker,
I'm not a nice guy'' !

122
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,154
You're way off, pal.

123
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,830
I don't think so. See, Ross,
because I think you love her!

124
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,070
I might have had feelings for her
at one time. Not anymore.

125
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,840
I just-- Marcel!

126
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,598
Where are you going
with that disk?

127
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,274
You are not putting that on again.

128
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,234
If you press that button,
you are in very, very big trouble.

129
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,434
You believe what a jerk
Ross was being?

130
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,436
Yeah, I know.

131
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,676
He can get really competitive.

132
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,395
What?

133
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,272
''Hello, Kettle, this is Monica.
You're black! ''

134
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,873
Please!

135
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,910
I am not as bad as Ross.

136
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,908
I beg to differ.
The Pictionary incident?

137
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,519
That was not an incident.

138
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,072
I was gesturing and the plate
slipped out of my hand.

139
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,150
-I got an interview!
-You're kidding! Where?

140
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,676
Saks Fifth Avenue!

141
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,270
It's like the mother ship
is calling you home.

142
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,989
What's the job?

143
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,077
Assistant buyer!

144
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,276
I would be shopping. . .

145
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,477
. . .for a living!

146
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,069
That's Aunt Iris. This woman's been
playing poker since she was 5.

147
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,635
You've got to listen
to every word she says.

148
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,353
-Is Tony Randall dead?
-I don't think so.

149
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,591
He may be now.
I think I hit him with my car.

150
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,598
-My God! Really?
-No, that's bluffing! Lesson one!

151
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,473
Let me tell you something.

152
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,513
Everything you hear
at a poker game is pure crap!

153
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,471
-Nice earrings.
-Thank you.

154
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,071
Girls, sit down!

155
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,595
Aunt Iris, this is Phoebe,
and that's Rachel--

156
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,116
Listen, I am parked at a meter.
Let's do it.

157
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,031
Ross, could we please, please,
listen to anything else?

158
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,679
All right.

159
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,356
I'm gonna pay for that tonight.

160
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,998
Guys, guess what, guess what?

161
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,791
The fifth dentist caved, and now
they all recommend Trident?

162
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,835
No, the interview!

163
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,672
She loved me.
She absolutely loved me.

164
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,595
We talked for two and a half hours.
We have the same taste in clothes.

165
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,072
And I went to camp with her cousin.

166
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,312
And the job is perfect!
I can do this well!

167
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,589
That's great!

168
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,910
God! And she told
the funniest story.

169
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,037
Great, you'll tell us
and we'll laugh!

170
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,434
Let's play poker!

171
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,998
Listen, we talked about it. . .

172
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,272
. . .and if you don't want to play,
we completely understand.

173
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,670
We can play some other game. Like. . .

174
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,035
. . .Pictionary?

175
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,508
Very funny.

176
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,035
We'd give poker another try.
Shall we, ladies?

177
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,673
Yes, I think we should.

178
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,878
Rach, do you want me
to shuffle those?

179
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,680
That's okay,
I'm gonna give it a go.

180
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,313
So Pheebs owes 7.50.
Monica, you owe $ 1 0.00.

181
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,472
And, Rachel, you owe 1 5 big ones!

182
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,349
Thanks for teaching us ''Crossed-eyed
Mary. '' We gotta play that other way.

183
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,948
Here's my 7.50, but you should
know that this money is cursed.

184
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,071
-What?
-I cursed it!

185
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,719
So now bad things will happen
to he who spends it.

186
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,278
I'll take it.
Bad things happen to me anyway.

187
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,795
This way, I can break them up
with a movie.

188
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,955
So that just leaves the big
Greene poker machine, who owes 1 5.

189
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,479
It's so typical:

190
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,075
''I'm a man! I have a penis!

191
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,875
I have to win money
to exert my power over women! ''

192
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,759
You know, this isn't over.

193
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,032
We will play you again.
And we will win and you will lose.

194
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,832
And you will beg and we will laugh.

195
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,712
And we will take
every last dime you have.

196
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,474
And you will
hate yourselves forever!

197
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,879
Kind of stepped on
my point there, Monica!

198
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,277
Wanna hand over your money now?

199
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,637
That way, we don't have to go
through the formality of playing.

200
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,558
No, that's fine. We'll see
who has the last laugh, monkey boy.

201
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,318
Are we done with the chit chat?
Ready for serious poker?

202
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:04,069
You guys, look! The one-eyed Jack
follows me wherever I go.

203
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,517
Right, okay. Serious poker.

204
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,716
Excuse me.
Where are you going?

205
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,796
To the bathroom.

206
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,629
Do you wanna go to the bathroom
or play poker?

207
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,433
I wanna go to the bathroom.

208
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,870
Well, I'm gonna order a pizza.

209
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,353
I'm waiting to hear from that job. The
store closes at 9. You can eat then.

210
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,073
That's fine. I'll just have
a Tic Tac to hold me over.

211
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,149
Cincinnati. No blinds.
Everybody ante.

212
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,316
Yes!

213
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,879
Or no!

214
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,198
Your money's mine, Greene.

215
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,992
Your fly's open, Geller.

216
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,358
You know what I just realized?

217
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,397
''Joker'' is ''poker'' with a ''J'' !

218
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,119
Coincidence?

219
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:06,068
That's ''joincidence'' with a ''C'' !

220
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,278
Yeah, I'm out.

221
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,389
I'm in.

222
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,715
Me too.

223
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,678
Me too.
What do you got?

224
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,917
You better hop out of the shower,
because I got a flush.

225
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,278
Well, well, well!

226
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:39,071
Hop back in, bucko,
because I got four 6s!

227
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,113
I got four 6s!
I won! I actually won!

228
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,196
Oh, my God!

229
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,358
You know what?
I'm gonna make a little Ross pile.

230
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,471
I think that one was Ross' .
And I think that one was Ross' .

231
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,629
Well, I have got your money
And you'll never see it

232
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,990
And your fly's still open

233
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,077
I made you look

234
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,314
-I'm in.
-I couldn't be inner.

235
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,028
Monica, in or out?

236
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,072
I hate this game!

237
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,399
Okay, Joey, your bet.

238
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,717
I fold, like a cheap hooker
who got hit in the stomach. . .

239
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,713
. . .by a fat guy
with sores on his face.

240
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,309
I'm out.

241
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,471
I'm very in.

242
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,555
Couldn't be more out.

243
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,670
Me too.

244
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,315
I will see you and I'll raise you.

245
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,637
Do you wanna waste another buck?

246
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,879
No, not this time.

247
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,391
-What did you have?
-I'm not telling.

248
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,715
Come on, show them.

249
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,513
-Get your hands out of there!
-I've had dates like this.

250
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,678
Boy, you really can't stand
to lose, can you?

251
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,875
Your whole face is getting red.

252
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,476
Little veins popping out
of your temple.

253
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,357
Plus that shirt doesn't really
match those pants.

254
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,675
-I'm not losing. Just deal the--
-You are definitely losing.

255
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,955
Rachel Greene.

256
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:24,995
Excuse me.

257
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,952
It's about the job!

258
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,755
Barbara, hi! How are you?

259
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,559
No, I understand.

260
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,270
Come on. No, I'm fine.
Don't be silly.

261
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,795
But, you know, if anything else
opens up, please--

262
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,075
Sorry, Rach.

263
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,914
You know, there's gonna be
lots of other stuff.

264
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,273
Where were we?

265
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,433
Five card draw. Jacks are better.

266
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,039
Nothing wild, everybody ante.

267
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,876
Look, Rach,
we don't have to do this.

268
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,073
Yes, we do.

269
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,636
-All right. Check.
-Check.

270
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,314
I'm in for 50 cents.

271
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,270
-Call.
-I'm in.

272
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,720
I see your 50 cents. . .

273
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,871
. . .and I raise you. . .

274
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,356
. . . $5.

275
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,390
I thought it was a 50-cent limit.

276
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,399
I just lost a job, and
I'd like to raise the bet $5.

277
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,676
Does anybody
have a problem with that?

278
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,676
-Not at all.
-No, no.

279
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,709
Loser?

280
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,589
No, I fold.

281
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,275
What do you mean, you ''fold''?
What is this?

282
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,718
I thought that, ''Once the cards
are dealt, I'm not a nice guy! ''

283
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,393
Were you just full of it?

284
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,069
I'm in.

285
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,956
-How many do you want?
-One.

286
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,078
Dealer takes two.

287
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,399
-What do you bet?
-I bet $2.

288
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,273
See your 2. . .

289
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,076
. . .and I raise you. . .

290
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,356
. . .20.

291
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:54,910
I see your 20. . .

292
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,756
. . .raise you 25.

293
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,871
See your 25. . .

294
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,998
. . .and, Monica, get my purse.

295
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,913
There's nothing in it.

296
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,270
Okay, then get me your purse.

297
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,753
Here you go. Good luck!

298
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,949
Thank you.

299
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,910
I saw your 25 and I raise you. . .

300
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,236
. . .seven.

301
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,915
--teen!

302
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,718
Joey, I'm a little shy.

303
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,474
That's okay, Ross. You can ask me.

304
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,471
-What do you need?
-Fifteen.

305
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,517
-Here's 1 0.
-I got 5.

306
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,751
-Thank you.
-Good luck.

307
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,314
I am calling your 1 7.

308
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,118
What do you got?

309
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,674
Full house!

310
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,879
You got me.

311
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,959
-That's a tough hand to beat.
-I thought we had them!

312
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,835
When you don't have the cards,
you don't have the cards.

313
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,917
But look how happy she is.

314
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,750
-Airmail.
-Airplane.

315
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,678
Airport.
Airport '7 5!

316
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,832
Airport '7 7! Airport '79!

317
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,555
Time's up.

318
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,799
Bye Bye Birdie!

319
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,073
That's a bird?

320
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,279
That's a bird!

321
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,472
Okay, it's my turn.

322
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,515
Go!

323
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,917
Bean! Bean!

324
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,075
The Unbearable Lightness of Being!

325
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,753
That you get?

326
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,076
That you get?
