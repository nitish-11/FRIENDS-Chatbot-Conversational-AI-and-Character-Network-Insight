1
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,539
This is unbelievable!
It's been half an hour.

2
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,096
If this was a cartoon,
you'd look like a ham about now.

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,131
There's the waitress.
Excuse me!

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,695
-Hello, miss?
-It's Phoebe!

5
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,139
Okay, will that be all?

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,175
Wait, wait.
What are you doing here?

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25,609
I was over there. . .

8
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,374
. . .then you said, ''Excuse me, miss. ''
So now I'm here.

9
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,250
How come you're working here?

10
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:35,414
Because it's close to where I live,
and the aprons are really cute.

11
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:36,935
Can we start over?

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,495
Okay, great.
I'm gonna be over here.

13
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,857
The One With the Two Parts - Part I

14
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,129
English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

15
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,373
I don't know if he's testing me
or just acting out. . .

16
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,094
. . .but my monkey is out of control!

17
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,097
He keeps erasing
the messages on my machine.

18
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,490
Supposedly by accident.

19
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,732
Yeah, I've done that.

20
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,336
And three days in a row, he got
to the newspaper before I did. . .

21
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,696
. . .and peed all over the crossword!

22
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,211
I've never done that.

23
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,218
Now tell me she doesn't look
exactly like her sister.

24
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,731
I'm saying I see a difference.

25
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,089
They're twins.

26
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,730
I don't care.
Phoebe's Phoebe. Ursula's hot.

27
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,899
You know that thing
when we talk about things?

28
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,892
Let's not do that anymore.

29
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,930
Hey, Pheebs.
Guess who we saw today?

30
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,729
Oh, fun!

31
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,534
-Liam Neeson.
-No.

32
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,139
Morley Safer.

33
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,938
The woman who cuts my hair!

34
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,136
This could be a really long game.

35
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,529
Your sister, Ursula.

36
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,134
Oh, really?

37
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,018
She works at that place. . . .

38
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,289
Riff's. Yeah, I know.

39
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,179
You do? She said you guys
haven't talked in years.

40
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,290
So is she fat?

41
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,496
Not from where I was standing.

42
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,413
Where were you standing?

43
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:53,098
Pheebs, so you guys
just don't get along?

44
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,094
It's mostly just dumb
sister stuff, you know?

45
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,377
Everyone always thought of her
as the pretty one.

46
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,818
She was the first to walk. . .

47
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,813
. . .even though I did it
later that same day.

48
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,089
To my parents, by then it was,
''Yeah, what else is new?''

49
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,538
I'm sorry. I've gotta go.
I've got Lamaze class.

50
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,891
And I've got earth science,
but I'll catch you in gym?

51
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,891
Is this just gonna be you and Carol?

52
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,732
Susan will be there too.

53
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:30,098
We've got dads, we've got lesbians.
The whole parenting team.

54
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,378
Isn't that gonna be weird?

55
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,617
It might have been at first. . .

56
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,294
. . .but now I'm comfortable
with the situation.

57
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,450
That's my jacket.

58
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,695
I know.

59
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,688
We're the Rostens.

60
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,539
I'm J.C. and he's Michael.

61
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,658
And we're having a boy and a girl.

62
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,889
Good for you!
Alrighty, next?

63
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,899
I'm Ross Geller.

64
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,330
And that's my boy in there.

65
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:11,096
And this is Carol Willick,
and this is Susan Bunch.

66
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,099
Susan is Carol's. . . .

67
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,494
Who's next?

68
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,768
Sorry, Susan is. . .?

69
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,050
-Susan is Carol's friend.
-Life partner.

70
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,898
Like buddies.

71
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,496
Like lovers.

72
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,096
You know how close women can get.

73
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,730
-Susan and I live together.
-I was married to her.

74
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,534
-Carol, not me.
-It's a little complicated.

75
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,059
-But we're fine.
-Absolutely.

76
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,299
So, twins!

77
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,808
That's like two birds.

78
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,098
--to you too, Helen!

79
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,334
Nina Bookbinder is here to see you.

80
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,491
Okay, send her in.

81
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,898
-Come on in.
-You wanted to see me?

82
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,938
I was just going over your data.

83
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,495
You've been postdating
your Friday numbers.

84
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,657
Which is bad, because. . .?

85
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,657
It throws my WENUS out of whack.

86
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,776
Excuse me?

87
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,609
WENUS.

88
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,930
Weekly Estimated
Net Usage Statistics.

89
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,937
Right. Gotcha, gotcha.

90
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,894
Won't happen again. I wouldn't
want to do anything to hurt your. . .

91
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,169
. . .WENUS.

92
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,497
It's not just that she's cute, okay?
It's just that. . .

93
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,890
. . .she's really, really cute.

94
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,299
It doesn't matter. You don't dip
your pen in the company ink.

95
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,095
Ross.

96
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,689
Your little creature's
got the remote again.

97
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,374
Marcel, give Rossy the remote.

98
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,769
Marcel!

99
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,097
Marcel, you give Rossy
the remote right now!

100
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,536
You give Rossy the remote--

101
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,489
-Great.
-Relax. I'll fix it.

102
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,570
Oh, cool.

103
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,730
Urkel. . .

104
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,494
. . .in Spanish is Urkel.

105
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,491
How did he do this?

106
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,650
Is leaving the Christmas lights up. . .

107
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,328
. . .your plan to keep us
merry all year long?

108
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,612
Someone was supposed to take
them down around New Year's. . .

109
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,532
. . .but obviously someone forgot!

110
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,335
Someone was supposed to write:

111
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:48,294
''Rach, take down the lights''
and put it on the refrigera--

112
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,297
How long has that been there?

113
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,776
Where you been?

114
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,730
Riff's. I think Ursula likes me.
All I ordered was coffee.

115
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:02,495
She brought me a tuna melt
and four plates of curly fries.

116
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,689
Score.

117
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,689
She is so hot!

118
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,334
Okay, before you do
anything Joey-like. . .

119
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,730
. . .you might want to run it by. . . .

120
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,649
Pheebs?

121
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,215
Would it be okay
if I asked out your sister?

122
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,492
Why? Why would you
want to do that? Why?

123
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,578
So that if we went out on a date,
she'd be there.

124
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:37,613
Well, I mean, I'm not
my sister's, you know. . .

125
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,088
. . .whatever.

126
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,892
And I mean, it's true,
we were one egg once.

127
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,094
But, you know,
we've grown apart, so. . . .

128
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,978
I don't know. Why not?

129
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,534
Cool. Thanks.

130
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,215
You okay?

131
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,893
Yeah, I'm fine.

132
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,094
Do you wanna watch
Laverne y Shirley?

133
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,895
Sorry.

134
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,730
Sorry I'm late.
Where's Carol?

135
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:23,017
Stuck at school.
Some parent-teacher thing.

136
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,774
You can go.
I'll get the information.

137
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,971
No, I think I should stay.
We should both know what's going on.

138
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,329
Oh, good.

139
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,933
This will be fun.

140
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:38,452
We're gonna start with some basic
third-stage breathing exercises.

141
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,332
Mommies, get on your back.

142
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:44,289
And, coaches, you should be
supporting Mommy's head.

143
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:51,935
-What?
-What?

144
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,818
I'm supposed to be the mommy?

145
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:57,296
Okay, I'm gonna play
my sperm card one more time.

146
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,775
I have to miss out on the coaching
training because I'm a woman?

147
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,698
So what do you propose to do?

148
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,090
-I'll flip you for it.
-Flip me for it?

149
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,779
Heads, heads, heads!

150
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,336
On your back, Mom!

151
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,093
All right, Mommies, take
a nice, deep, cleansing breath.

152
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,376
Good.

153
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,378
Now imagine your vagina is opening. . .

154
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,491
. . .like a flower.

155
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,771
Mr. Dee! How's it going, sir?

156
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,208
It's been better.

157
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,169
The Annual Net Usage
Statistics are in.

158
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,899
It's pretty ugly.

159
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,297
We haven't seen an ANUS
this bad since the '70s.

160
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,410
What's it mean?

161
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,016
We'll be laying off people.

162
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:00,055
I know I was late last week.
I slept funny and my hair was snarly.

163
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,488
Not you.

164
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,299
Relax.

165
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,898
Ever have to fire anyone?

166
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,370
Nina. . . .

167
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,535
Nina.

168
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,250
Are you okay?

169
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,777
Yes. Yes, I am.

170
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:29,089
Listen, the reason that
I called you in here today was. . . .

171
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,099
Please don't hate me.

172
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,696
What?

173
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,050
Would you like
to have dinner sometime?

174
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,489
So, what do you want
for your birthday?

175
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:49,019
What I really want is for my mom
to be alive and enjoy it with me.

176
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,892
Let me put it this way.
Anything from Crabtree & Evelyn?

177
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,738
Bath salts would be nice!

178
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:00,890
Good.

179
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,733
What is this place?

180
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,540
You're cold, I have to pee,
and there's coffee.

181
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,492
How bad could it be?

182
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,691
I think we have an answer.

183
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,489
What's she doing here?

184
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,891
This could be God's way
of telling us to eat at home.

185
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,254
-Think she got fired at Riff's?
-No, we were there last night.

186
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,020
She kept bringing swordfish.
Are you gonna go. . .?

187
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,330
I'll wait until we order.
It's her, right?

188
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,935
It looks like her.

189
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,892
Excuse me?

190
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,979
Hi, it's us!

191
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,691
Right. And it's me!

192
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,572
So you're here too?

193
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,698
As much as you are.

194
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,295
Your turn.

195
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,415
We know what we want.

196
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,690
That's good.

197
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,328
-Two caffe lattes.
-And some biscotti cookies.

198
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,088
Good choice.

199
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,693
It's definitely her.

200
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,335
I can't believe you.

201
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,538
You still haven't told that girl
she doesn't have a job?

202
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,093
You still haven't taken down
the Christmas lights.

203
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,616
Congratulations! I think you found
the world's thinnest argument.

204
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,137
Trying to find the right moment.

205
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:35,292
That shouldn't be so hard,
now that you're dating.

206
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:40,812
''Sweetheart, you're fired. But how
about a quickie before I go to work?''

207
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,297
Once you're inside,
you don't have to knock anymore.

208
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,893
I'll get it.

209
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,892
Hi, Mr. Heckles.

210
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,449
You're doing it again.

211
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,093
We're not doing anything.

212
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,292
We're just sitting around
talking quietly.

213
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,491
I can hear you through the ceiling.

214
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,296
My cats can't sleep.

215
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,578
You don't even have cats.

216
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,611
I could have cats.

217
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,249
Goodbye, Mr. Heckles.

218
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,894
We'll try to keep it down.

219
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,494
Phoebe, can you do me a favor?

220
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,657
Try this on to make sure it fits.

221
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:34,614
My first birthday present!
Oh, this is really--

222
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,932
It's for Ursula.
I just figured, you know, size-wise.

223
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,054
Sure. Yeah.

224
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,579
Okay, it fits.

225
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,009
Are you seeing her again?

226
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,336
Yep, Ice Capades.

227
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,735
This is serious.

228
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,091
I've never known you to pay money
for any kind of ''capade. ''

229
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,932
I don't know. I like her.

230
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:01,377
She's different.
There's something about her--

231
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,775
That you like.
We get it. You like her.

232
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,128
Phoebe, I asked you
and you said it was okay.

233
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,171
Well, maybe now it's not okay.

234
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:15,691
Well, maybe now I'm not okay
with it not being okay.

235
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,732
Knit, good woman.
Knit! Knit!

236
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:38,299
And that's the Chrysler Building
right there.

237
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,493
Mr. Douglas.

238
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,969
Cool tie.

239
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,290
She's still here.

240
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,090
Yes. Yes, she is.

241
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,808
Didn't I memo you?

242
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:56,736
After I let her go, I got a call
from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen. . .

243
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,459
. . .Dr. Flanan, Dr. Flan.

244
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:03,698
And he informed me that
she took the news rather badly.

245
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,539
In fact, he mentioned
the word ''frenzy. ''

246
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,734
She seems so. . . .

247
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,692
Oh, no, no.
Nina? She's. . . .

248
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,696
In fact, if you asked her now. . .

249
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,698
. . .she'd have no recollection
of being fired at all.

250
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,055
That's unbelievable.

251
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,852
And yet believable.

252
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,496
So I decided not to fire her again. . .

253
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,931
. . .until I'm sure she will be
of no threat to herself or others.

254
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:32,898
I see. You never really know what's
going on inside a person's head.

255
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:36,896
Well, I guess that's why
they call it psychology, sir.

256
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,498
The sound Mom and Dad
will never forget.

257
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,817
For this, after all,
is the miracle of birth.

258
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,288
Lights, please.

259
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,939
And that's having a baby.

260
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,296
Next week is our final class.

261
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,293
Susan, go deep.

262
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,290
It's impossible.
It's just impossible.

263
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,535
What is, honey?

264
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,532
What that woman. . .

265
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,729
. . .did.

266
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,300
I am not doing that!

267
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,532
It'll have to stay in, that's all.
Everything will be the same.

268
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,658
-It'll just stay in.
-Carol, honey.

269
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,420
-Everything will be all right.
-What do you know?

270
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,339
No one's saying to you,
''Hi, is that your nostril?

271
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,969
Mind if we push
this pot roast through it?! ''

272
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,693
Carol, sweetie.

273
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,293
Cleansing breath.

274
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,538
I know it's frightening.
But big picture:

275
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,055
The birth part is just one day. . .

276
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:39,453
. . .and when it's over, we'll all
be parents for the rest of our lives.

277
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,494
I mean, that's what
this is all about, right?

278
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,729
Ross?

279
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:45,816
Ross.

280
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,457
I'm gonna be a father.

281
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:52,731
-This is just occurring to you?
-I knew I was having a baby.

282
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:56,091
I just never realized
the baby was having me.

283
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,331
You're gonna be great.

284
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,899
How could you say that?

285
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,092
I can't even get Marcel
to stop eating the bathmat.

286
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,099
How will I raise a kid?

287
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,730
You know, some scientists
are now saying. . .

288
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,892
. . .that monkeys and babies
are actually different.

289
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,289
-Where are you going?
-Out.

290
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,893
With. . .?

291
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,618
Can I just ask you one question?

292
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,893
Have you two, you know,
like, you know?

293
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,495
You know?

294
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,415
Yet?

295
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,137
Not that it's any
of your business. . .

296
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,018
. . .but no, we haven't.

297
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,491
You meant sex, right?

298
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,333
-Do you have a sec?
-Sure, Nina. What's up?

299
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,972
For the past few days,
people have been avoiding me. . .

300
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,057
. . .and giving me strange looks.

301
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,495
Oh, well, maybe that's because. . .

302
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,219
. . .they're jealous of us.

303
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,854
Maybe.

304
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:09,097
But that doesn't explain why
they keep taking my scissors.

305
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:13,655
Well, maybe that's because
you're getting a big raise!

306
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,971
-I am?
-Sure. Why not?

307
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:20,093
Oh, my God!
You're amazing!

308
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,491
Oh, you don't know.

309
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,616
Helen, make sure we do the paperwork
on Miss Bookbinder's raise.

310
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:31,099
You still want me to send her
psychological profile to personnel?

311
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,693
Helen drinks.

312
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,098
Will you marry me?

313
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,139
-I ended up telling her everything.
-How'd she take it?

314
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,293
Pretty well.
Except for the stapler thing.

315
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,658
Little tip. If you're ever
in a similar situation. . .

316
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:54,499
. . .never, ever leave
your hand on the desk.

317
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,493
Okay, I think I get how to do this.

318
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,094
Can we turn this off?
Can we make them go away?

319
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,092
Because I can't watch.

320
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,290
They're gone.

321
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,458
Are you all right?

322
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:16,414
Yeah. It's just this whole
stupid Ursula thing.

323
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,133
Okay, can I ask. . .?

324
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:21,497
So he's going out with her.
Is it really so terrible?

325
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,010
Yeah.

326
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,737
I mean, I'm not saying
she's evil or anything.

327
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,699
She's just, you know,
always breaking my stuff.

328
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,731
When I was 8, I wouldn't let her
have my Judy Jetson thermos. . .

329
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,896
. . .so she threw it under the bus.

330
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,498
And then there's Randy Brown. . .

331
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,099
. . .who was like. . . .

332
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:44,338
Have you ever had a boyfriend
who was your best friend?

333
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,335
Well, but that's what he was for me.

334
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,929
And she, you know,
kind of stole him away. . .

335
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,899
. . .and then broke his heart.

336
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,214
And then he wouldn't
even talk to me anymore.

337
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:03,533
He didn't want to be around anything
that looked like either one of us.

338
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:11,293
I mean, I know Joey's not
my boyfriend or my thermos. . .

339
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,693
. . .or anything, but. . . .

340
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,579
-You won't lose him.
-You gotta talk to Joey.

341
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,056
Yeah, okay.

342
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,252
He doesn't know this stuff.
If he knew how you felt. . . .

343
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,018
He's falling in love with her.

344
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,131
They've been going out a week.

345
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:29,498
They haven't even slept together yet.
I mean, that's not serious.

346
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,293
May we help you?

00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:15,337
What are you doing? It's freezing!
Would you come inside?

348
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,292
No, no, no.

00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,094
You wanted me to take them down. . .
