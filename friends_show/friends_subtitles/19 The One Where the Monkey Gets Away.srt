1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,075
Okay, I checked.

2
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:06,874
We have EarI Grey, EngIish Breakfast,
cinnamon stick. . .

3
00:00:07,116 --> 00:00:10,665
. . .chamomiIe, Mint MedIey,
bIackberry and. . . .

4
00:00:10,913 --> 00:00:13,473
Wait, there's one more. . . .
Lemon Soother!

5
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,222
You're not the guy that asked
for the tea, are you?

6
00:00:20,506 --> 00:00:22,497
The One Where the Monkey Gets Away

7
00:00:23,743 --> 00:00:24,732
English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

8
00:01:10,507 --> 00:01:13,021
Mail call!
Rachel Greene, bunk seven.

9
00:01:13,225 --> 00:01:14,783
Thank you.

10
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:19,060
Oh, cool!
A free sample of coffee.

11
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,013
Oh, good, because
where else would we get any?

12
00:01:23,737 --> 00:01:25,375
Oh, right.

13
00:01:26,934 --> 00:01:27,923
Great.

14
00:01:28,253 --> 00:01:29,242
What is it?

15
00:01:29,452 --> 00:01:31,204
Country club newsletter.

16
00:01:31,451 --> 00:01:36,002
My mother sends me the engagement
notices for inspiration.

17
00:01:36,927 --> 00:01:38,155
Oh, my God!

18
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,556
Oh, my God!
It's Barry and Mindy!

19
00:01:40,804 --> 00:01:42,556
-Barry, who you almost--?
-Barry, who I almost--

20
00:01:42,762 --> 00:01:44,275
-And Mindy, your maid of--
-Mindy, my maid of--

21
00:01:44,481 --> 00:01:46,949
Let me see.
That's Mindy?

22
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,274
Wow! She is pretty.

23
00:01:50,636 --> 00:01:51,751
Lucky. . .

24
00:01:53,234 --> 00:01:55,668
. . .to have had a friend like you.

25
00:02:00,029 --> 00:02:02,782
Marcel, bring me the rice.
Come on, bring me the rice.

26
00:02:02,986 --> 00:02:04,658
Good boy.
Give me the rice.

27
00:02:04,905 --> 00:02:06,463
Thank you. Good boy.

28
00:02:06,823 --> 00:02:09,621
He's mastered the difference
between ''bring me the'' . . .

29
00:02:09,821 --> 00:02:11,539
. . .and ''pee in the. ''

30
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:16,937
''Bring me the'' and--
Rach?

31
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:20,527
Oh, I'm sorry.

32
00:02:21,412 --> 00:02:23,050
This is so stupid!

33
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,327
I mean, I gave Barry up, right?

34
00:02:25,529 --> 00:02:27,520
I should be happy for them.

35
00:02:27,727 --> 00:02:29,365
I am. I'm happy for them.

36
00:02:29,966 --> 00:02:31,319
Really?

37
00:02:32,883 --> 00:02:36,239
I guess it would be different
if I were with somebody.

38
00:02:36,441 --> 00:02:37,794
Whoa, what. . . .

39
00:02:38,999 --> 00:02:41,957
What happened to
''Forget relationships!

40
00:02:42,196 --> 00:02:45,506
I'm done with men''?
The whole penis embargo?

41
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,219
I don't know.

42
00:02:51,469 --> 00:02:53,221
I guess it's not about ''no guys. ''

43
00:02:53,467 --> 00:02:55,537
It's about the ''right guy,''
you know?

44
00:02:55,786 --> 00:02:56,582
With Barry. . .

45
00:02:56,785 --> 00:02:59,777
. . .it was safe and it was easy,
but there was no heat.

46
00:03:00,022 --> 00:03:02,013
With Paolo, all there was, was heat.

47
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,737
And I mean, it was just
this raw, animal, sexual--

48
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:07,889
Right, right! I got it.

49
00:03:08,696 --> 00:03:09,890
I was there.

50
00:03:10,814 --> 00:03:12,884
But do you think
you can ever have both?

51
00:03:13,132 --> 00:03:15,088
Someone that's your best friend. . .

52
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,639
. . .but then also can make
your toes curl.

53
00:03:20,047 --> 00:03:22,481
Yes, I do. I really do.

54
00:03:23,045 --> 00:03:24,922
In fact, it's funny.

55
00:03:25,123 --> 00:03:27,921
Often, someone who
you wouldn't think could. . .

56
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,312
. . .curl your toes. . .

57
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:32,794
. . .might just be the one who--

58
00:03:34,196 --> 00:03:35,515
--gets interrupted.

59
00:03:35,755 --> 00:03:37,313
Hey, guys, how was the movie?

60
00:03:37,513 --> 00:03:39,105
-Wonderful!
-It was so good!

61
00:03:39,312 --> 00:03:42,065
-Suck fest.
-Total chick flick.

62
00:03:44,108 --> 00:03:48,499
I'm sorry it wasn't one of those
movies with, like, guns and bombs. . .

63
00:03:48,705 --> 00:03:50,855
. . .and buses going really fast!

64
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:55,655
I don't need violence
to enjoy a movie. . .

65
00:03:55,899 --> 00:03:58,459
. . .as long as
there's a little nudity.

66
00:03:58,737 --> 00:03:59,567
There was nudity.

67
00:03:59,776 --> 00:04:00,970
I meant female nudity.

68
00:04:02,174 --> 00:04:04,768
I don't need to see
Lou Grant frolicking.

69
00:04:05,692 --> 00:04:07,523
Hugh! Hugh Grant!

70
00:04:09,529 --> 00:04:11,440
All right, I've got to go.

71
00:04:11,647 --> 00:04:13,000
Come on, Marcel.
Come on!

72
00:04:13,206 --> 00:04:16,835
We're gonna go take a bath.
Yes, we are, aren't we?

73
00:04:17,243 --> 00:04:19,632
They're still just friends, right?

74
00:04:23,278 --> 00:04:25,348
And I will see you tomorrow.

75
00:04:25,596 --> 00:04:28,474
Right. You're gonna spend
tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's.

76
00:04:28,674 --> 00:04:31,393
Hang on. Does Aunt Monica
get a say in this?

77
00:04:31,991 --> 00:04:34,346
Please, Aunt Monica, please?

78
00:04:34,549 --> 00:04:36,426
Oh, unclench.
You won't even be here.

79
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:45,258
I can't believe
we're having this discussion.

80
00:04:45,501 --> 00:04:48,618
I agree.
I'm, like, in disbelief.

81
00:04:49,178 --> 00:04:50,816
If it was gonna happen
with Rachel. . .

82
00:04:51,056 --> 00:04:52,489
. . .wouldn't it
have happened already?

83
00:04:52,695 --> 00:04:55,004
She said she's looking
for a relationship. . .

84
00:04:55,213 --> 00:04:56,965
. . .with someone exactly like me.

85
00:04:57,412 --> 00:04:58,401
She said that?

86
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,040
Well, I added
the ''exactly like me'' part.

87
00:05:02,288 --> 00:05:04,404
But she said
she's looking for someone.

88
00:05:04,606 --> 00:05:06,483
And someone will be there tonight.

89
00:05:06,804 --> 00:05:07,919
''Tonight'' tonight?

90
00:05:08,323 --> 00:05:10,837
It's perfect.
It'll just be the two of us.

91
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:14,198
She spent all day
taking care of my monkey.

92
00:05:16,557 --> 00:05:19,993
I can't remember the last time
a girl took care of my monkey.

93
00:05:24,151 --> 00:05:28,144
Anyway, I figured after work,
I'd go pick up a bottle of wine. . .

94
00:05:28,348 --> 00:05:31,738
. . .go over there
and try to woo her.

95
00:05:33,424 --> 00:05:34,857
You know what you should do?

96
00:05:35,062 --> 00:05:38,213
Take her back to the 1 890s
when that phrase was last used.

97
00:05:42,736 --> 00:05:44,215
If you keep this up...

98
00:05:44,455 --> 00:05:46,764
... you'll be finished
by the weekend.

99
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:50,085
Now, the one in the feathered boa,
that's Dr. Francis.

100
00:05:50,331 --> 00:05:52,561
Now, she used to be a man.

101
00:05:52,849 --> 00:05:54,328
Look. See, there's Raven.

102
00:05:54,527 --> 00:05:56,119
We hate her.

103
00:05:56,326 --> 00:05:57,998
We're glad she's dying.

104
00:05:58,244 --> 00:06:00,553
And then--
What? Marcel!

105
00:06:00,802 --> 00:06:04,351
Are you playing with Monica's shoes?
You're not supposed to--

106
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:10,030
Marcel, did you poo in the shoe?

107
00:06:10,235 --> 00:06:13,068
Oh, Marcel! Bad monkey!

108
00:06:13,313 --> 00:06:14,951
Oh, God!

109
00:06:20,148 --> 00:06:21,945
Sorry, Barry.

110
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:24,502
A little engagement gift.

111
00:06:24,704 --> 00:06:27,298
I'm sure you didn't
register for that.

112
00:06:34,616 --> 00:06:36,527
Who died? Who died?

113
00:06:37,094 --> 00:06:39,608
Roll him over!
Come on, roll him over!

114
00:06:40,772 --> 00:06:44,890
Well, we know it wasn't Dexter,
right, Marcel? Because--

115
00:06:45,088 --> 00:06:46,077
Marcel?

116
00:06:49,685 --> 00:06:51,755
-How could you lose him?
-I don't know!

117
00:06:52,003 --> 00:06:55,439
We were watching TV,
then he pooped in Monica's shoe. . . .

118
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,433
Wait. He pooped in my shoe?
Which one?

119
00:06:58,638 --> 00:06:59,673
I don't know.

120
00:06:59,917 --> 00:07:01,430
The left one!

121
00:07:01,715 --> 00:07:02,625
Which ones?

122
00:07:02,834 --> 00:07:06,668
Those little clunky Amish things
you think go with everything.

123
00:07:10,549 --> 00:07:13,063
Why is the air in here so negative?

124
00:07:14,465 --> 00:07:16,137
Rachel lost Marcel.

125
00:07:16,384 --> 00:07:17,180
Oh, no! How?

126
00:07:17,423 --> 00:07:19,493
-He pooped in my shoe.
-Which one?

127
00:07:19,741 --> 00:07:21,891
Those cute black ones
I wear all the time.

128
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,653
No, which one?

129
00:07:24,338 --> 00:07:26,056
The right or left?

130
00:07:27,056 --> 00:07:29,047
Because the left one is lucky.

131
00:07:29,374 --> 00:07:30,887
Come on!
What am I gonna do?

132
00:07:31,093 --> 00:07:32,811
All right.
You're a monkey. . .

133
00:07:33,051 --> 00:07:34,689
. . .you're loose in the city.

134
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,448
Where do you go?

135
00:07:37,128 --> 00:07:40,757
It's his first time out, so he'll
do some of the touristy things.

136
00:07:43,723 --> 00:07:47,272
I'll go to Cats.
You go to the Russian Tea Room.

137
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,520
Oh, my God!
Come on, you guys!

138
00:07:50,757 --> 00:07:53,066
He'll be home any minute.
He'll kill me!

139
00:07:53,315 --> 00:07:55,670
Search the building.
You take the first and second floor.

140
00:07:55,913 --> 00:07:57,392
We'll take third and fourth.

141
00:07:57,592 --> 00:07:58,911
What am I gonna do?

142
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:01,420
You stay here
and just wait by the phone.

143
00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:04,826
Spray Lysol in my shoe
and wait for Ross to kill you.

144
00:08:05,346 --> 00:08:07,257
Does anybody want to trade?

145
00:08:14,739 --> 00:08:15,535
What do you want?

146
00:08:16,138 --> 00:08:19,414
Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey.
Have you seen it?

147
00:08:19,615 --> 00:08:22,812
I left a Belgian waffle out here.
Did you take it?

148
00:08:23,452 --> 00:08:25,249
Why'd you leave it in the hall?

149
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,119
I wasn't ready for it.

150
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:29,520
The monkey, have you seen a monkey?

151
00:08:30,766 --> 00:08:32,484
I saw Regis Philbin once.

152
00:08:33,444 --> 00:08:35,116
Thank you, Mr. Heckles.

153
00:08:36,242 --> 00:08:37,880
You owe me a waffle.

154
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,030
He's a black capuchin monkey
with a white face. . .

155
00:08:43,277 --> 00:08:47,395
. . .with Russian dressing
and pickles on the side.

156
00:08:48,313 --> 00:08:49,382
Thanks.

157
00:08:51,071 --> 00:08:52,299
How did it go today?

158
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:55,422
Oh, great!
It went great. Really great.

159
00:08:55,627 --> 00:08:56,901
Is that wine?

160
00:08:57,626 --> 00:08:58,900
You want some?

161
00:08:59,224 --> 00:09:00,942
Oh, I would love some.

162
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,413
But you know what?
Let's not drink it here.

163
00:09:03,621 --> 00:09:05,976
I feel crazy.
Do you want to go to Newark?

164
00:09:11,615 --> 00:09:15,608
We could. But before we go to
the murder capital of the Northeast. . .

165
00:09:16,451 --> 00:09:19,443
. . .I kind of wanted
to run something by you.

166
00:09:19,689 --> 00:09:22,203
You know how we
were talking before. . .

167
00:09:23,046 --> 00:09:25,037
. . .about relationships and stuff. . . .

168
00:09:25,284 --> 00:09:29,197
-Oh, God, Ross, I cannot do this!
-Okay, quick and painful.

169
00:09:37,715 --> 00:09:38,784
Oh, God!

170
00:09:39,154 --> 00:09:41,748
Okay, all right.
All right, okay.

171
00:09:42,271 --> 00:09:43,386
Please don't hate me.

172
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,345
What? What?

173
00:09:48,147 --> 00:09:49,865
You know Marcel?

174
00:09:53,263 --> 00:09:56,619
I kind of lost him.

175
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:13,841
I can't believe this.

176
00:10:14,087 --> 00:10:16,681
All I asked you to do was
keep him in the apartment!

177
00:10:16,884 --> 00:10:17,999
I know. I'm sorry.

178
00:10:18,203 --> 00:10:20,000
I guess it's partially my fault.

179
00:10:20,242 --> 00:10:22,915
I shouldn't have asked you
to start off with a monkey.

180
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,350
I should have started you off
with a pencil.

181
00:10:26,597 --> 00:10:28,155
I'm doing everything I can.

182
00:10:28,356 --> 00:10:31,154
I've got everybody looking
for him and I got--

183
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:35,184
-Who is it?
-Animal Control.

184
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:38,706
-I've even got Animal Control.
-You called Animal Control?

185
00:10:41,505 --> 00:10:43,894
Why? Do you not like them?

186
00:10:46,581 --> 00:10:50,620
Marcel is an illegal exotic animal.

187
00:10:53,616 --> 00:10:54,935
I'm not allowed to have him.

188
00:10:55,135 --> 00:10:58,525
If they find him,
they'll take him away from me.

189
00:10:59,172 --> 00:11:02,323
Well, now, see,
you never ever told us that.

190
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:06,559
Because I never expected you
to invite them to the apartment!

191
00:11:11,722 --> 00:11:13,041
Hi! Thanks for coming.

192
00:11:13,281 --> 00:11:15,112
Somebody called about a monkey?

193
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:18,835
You know what? That was
a complete misunderstanding.

194
00:11:19,036 --> 00:11:21,345
We thought we had a monkey,
but we didn't.

195
00:11:21,594 --> 00:11:23,550
-It turned out it was a hat.
-Cat!

196
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:28,185
We checked the third floor.
No one's seen Marcel.

197
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:29,458
My uncle Marcel.

198
00:11:29,668 --> 00:11:32,057
Is that who the monkey's named after?

199
00:11:33,425 --> 00:11:36,656
Possession of an illegal exotic
is punishable. . .

200
00:11:36,902 --> 00:11:39,894
. . .by two years in prison
and confiscation of the animal.

201
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,129
Oh, my God!

202
00:11:41,859 --> 00:11:44,134
You'd put that poor
little creature in jail?

203
00:11:49,533 --> 00:11:54,084
Remember how we talked about saying
things quietly to yourself first?

204
00:11:54,689 --> 00:11:57,078
Yes, but there isn't always time.

205
00:12:00,364 --> 00:12:04,880
I'm sure there's some friendly way
to reconcile this. Have a seat.

206
00:12:05,121 --> 00:12:07,316
We haven't been introduced.
I'm Monica Geller.

207
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:10,267
Oh, my God, you are!

208
00:12:10,516 --> 00:12:11,949
And you're Rachel Greene!

209
00:12:13,674 --> 00:12:16,108
Luisa Gianetti!
Lincoln High?

210
00:12:16,472 --> 00:12:19,669
I sat behind you guys in homeroom.

211
00:12:20,349 --> 00:12:23,307
Luisa! Oh, my God!

212
00:12:23,506 --> 00:12:25,542
Monica! It's Luisa!

213
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,656
Luisa! From homeroom!

214
00:12:29,862 --> 00:12:32,501
You have no idea who I am, do you?

215
00:12:32,739 --> 00:12:34,297
Not at all.

216
00:12:34,578 --> 00:12:38,412
Well, maybe that's because
you spent four years ignoring me.

217
00:12:39,094 --> 00:12:42,052
Would it have been so hard to say,
''Morning, Luisa'' . . .

218
00:12:42,292 --> 00:12:44,248
. . .or ''Nice overalls''?

219
00:12:49,646 --> 00:12:50,965
Oh, I'm so sorry!

220
00:12:51,165 --> 00:12:55,443
It's not so much you. You were fat.
You had your own problems.

221
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,315
But you. What a bitch!

222
00:13:01,317 --> 00:13:02,306
What?

223
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:04,825
You know what?
Be that as it may.

224
00:13:05,074 --> 00:13:09,067
Could you help us out here on that
monkey thing for old times' sake?

225
00:13:09,351 --> 00:13:11,023
Go, Bobcats!

226
00:13:11,789 --> 00:13:14,622
I could. But I won't.

227
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:17,625
If I find that monkey, he's mine.

228
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:23,691
Sorry.

229
00:13:27,977 --> 00:13:29,012
Marcel?

230
00:13:29,615 --> 00:13:30,604
Marcel?

231
00:13:38,488 --> 00:13:40,206
Hi, can I help you?

232
00:13:44,564 --> 00:13:48,318
We're kind of having an emergency,
and we were looking for something.

233
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,989
-A monkey.
-Yes, have you seen any?

234
00:13:52,238 --> 00:13:54,798
No, I haven't seen a monkey.

235
00:13:54,996 --> 00:13:56,634
Can you fix radiators?

236
00:13:56,834 --> 00:14:00,065
Sure! Did you try turning the knob
back the other way?

237
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:01,427
Of course!

238
00:14:01,631 --> 00:14:03,383
Oh. Then, no.

239
00:14:07,226 --> 00:14:09,421
Taste this daiquiri.
Is there too much rum?

240
00:14:09,664 --> 00:14:12,019
Just a second.
Hope you find your monkey.

241
00:14:12,262 --> 00:14:13,820
Oh, no, wait!

242
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,569
We may not know
about radiators, per se. . .

243
00:14:17,778 --> 00:14:22,294
. . .but we do have expertise
in the heating and cooling milieu.

244
00:14:26,012 --> 00:14:28,162
Weren't we in the middle
of something?

245
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:31,527
But these women are very hot
and they need our help.

246
00:14:32,766 --> 00:14:34,324
And they're very hot!

247
00:14:36,883 --> 00:14:38,601
We can't, all right?

248
00:14:38,842 --> 00:14:40,195
We're sorry.

249
00:14:40,441 --> 00:14:44,150
You have no idea how sorry.
But we promised to find this monkey.

250
00:14:44,357 --> 00:14:47,349
He's about yea high
and answers to the name Marcel.

251
00:14:47,555 --> 00:14:50,911
So if we could get pictures of you,
it'd help us out.

252
00:14:59,306 --> 00:15:02,298
From now on, you don't get
to talk to other people.

253
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:11,846
-Oh, my God!
-What?!

254
00:15:12,096 --> 00:15:14,894
Something just brushed up
against my right leg.

255
00:15:15,813 --> 00:15:18,327
Oh, it's okay.
It was just my left leg.

256
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,200
Look, Phoebe!

257
00:15:21,928 --> 00:15:23,964
Oh, Marcel! Come here!

258
00:15:24,207 --> 00:15:25,606
Step aside, ladies.

259
00:15:27,204 --> 00:15:30,162
-What are you gonna do?
-Just a small tranquilizer.

260
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:47,341
Run, Marcel! Run, Marcel!

261
00:15:47,629 --> 00:15:48,505
Damn!

262
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:49,578
Are you okay?

263
00:15:49,787 --> 00:15:51,937
I think so.

264
00:16:00,099 --> 00:16:00,895
Oh, gosh!

265
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,926
We've been all
over the neighborhood!

266
00:16:14,168 --> 00:16:15,601
He's gone!
He's just gone!

267
00:16:15,847 --> 00:16:18,805
-You don't know that.
-Come on! It's cold, it's dark.

268
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:21,080
He doesn't know the Village!

269
00:16:21,482 --> 00:16:23,712
And now I have a broken foot.
Oh, my--

270
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,190
I have no monkey and a broken foot.

271
00:16:26,439 --> 00:16:27,588
Thank you very much!

272
00:16:27,837 --> 00:16:30,510
I've said I'm sorry,
like, a million times.

273
00:16:30,755 --> 00:16:32,347
What do you want me to do?

274
00:16:32,554 --> 00:16:34,112
You want me to break my foot too?

275
00:16:34,312 --> 00:16:36,223
Here, I'll break my foot right now.

276
00:16:36,431 --> 00:16:39,741
Oh, my God!
There, are you happy now?

277
00:16:40,028 --> 00:16:43,065
Yeah, now that you kicked the sign. . .

278
00:16:43,745 --> 00:16:46,464
. . .I don't miss Marcel anymore!

279
00:16:48,501 --> 00:16:50,935
It's not like
I did this on purpose.

280
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:53,289
No, this is just vintage Rachel.

281
00:16:53,538 --> 00:16:55,847
Things just sort of happen around you!

282
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:59,287
You're off in ''Rachel Land,''
doing your ''Rachel Thing'' . . .

283
00:16:59,533 --> 00:17:04,288
. . .oblivious to people's monkeys
or to people's feelings and--

284
00:17:04,529 --> 00:17:07,362
I don't even want to hear it!
Forget it, okay?

285
00:17:08,286 --> 00:17:09,639
What? What?

286
00:17:12,803 --> 00:17:14,634
Hey, banana man!

287
00:17:20,876 --> 00:17:22,355
Oh, this is so intense!

288
00:17:22,595 --> 00:17:27,430
One side of my butt is totally asleep
and the other side has no idea.

289
00:17:31,428 --> 00:17:33,623
Hi! Did you order some bananas?

290
00:17:33,866 --> 00:17:36,221
-What about it?
-Give me my monkey back!

291
00:17:36,464 --> 00:17:37,419
I don't have a monkey.

292
00:17:37,743 --> 00:17:40,337
-Then what's with all the bananas?
-Potassium.

293
00:17:45,457 --> 00:17:47,209
Okay, where is he?
Where is he?

294
00:17:53,851 --> 00:17:55,000
What have you done to him?

295
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,525
That's my monkey.
That's Patty the monkey.

296
00:17:59,566 --> 00:18:00,999
Are you insane?

297
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,002
Come here, Marcel.

298
00:18:03,204 --> 00:18:04,319
Come here, Patty.

299
00:18:04,523 --> 00:18:05,956
Come here, Marcel.

300
00:18:06,441 --> 00:18:07,317
Come here, Patty.

301
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,391
Here, monkey.
Here, monkey.

302
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:11,993
Gotcha!

303
00:18:13,276 --> 00:18:15,790
-Give me my monkey back!
-That's my monkey.

304
00:18:16,034 --> 00:18:17,911
Take this up with the judge.

305
00:18:18,112 --> 00:18:20,148
That's not my monkey.
Just the dress is mine.

306
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,227
You can send it back whenever.

307
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:24,427
All right, I want my monkey!

308
00:18:24,707 --> 00:18:26,345
Oh, come on, Luisa.

309
00:18:26,546 --> 00:18:27,535
Sorry, prom queen.

310
00:18:27,745 --> 00:18:30,862
You had to be a bitch in school,
you couldn't have been fat.

311
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,410
In high school,
I was the prom queen. . .

312
00:18:35,659 --> 00:18:38,969
. . .and the homecoming queen
and the class president and you. . .

313
00:18:39,216 --> 00:18:41,127
. . .were also there.

314
00:18:41,334 --> 00:18:43,211
If you take this monkey, I'll lose. . .

315
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:46,132
. . .one of the most
important people in my life.

316
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:49,925
You can hate me if you want,
but please do not punish him.

317
00:18:50,127 --> 00:18:53,164
Luisa, you have a chance
to be the bigger person here.

318
00:18:53,445 --> 00:18:54,241
Take it!

319
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:03,958
Then I'll call your supervisor
and tell her. . .

320
00:19:04,157 --> 00:19:06,910
. . .you shot my friend
in the ass with a dart!

321
00:19:13,989 --> 00:19:16,549
It'll be nice
to get this off, won't it?

322
00:19:16,787 --> 00:19:19,540
Or we can leave it on for now.
That's fine.

323
00:19:19,824 --> 00:19:23,499
With the right pair of pumps,
that would be a great little outfit.

324
00:19:27,379 --> 00:19:28,528
Listen. . . .

325
00:19:29,137 --> 00:19:31,651
I'm sorry I was
so hard on you before--

326
00:19:31,855 --> 00:19:34,847
No, come on. It was my fault.
I almost lost your--

327
00:19:35,053 --> 00:19:38,602
But you got him back.
You were great.

328
00:19:42,607 --> 00:19:46,122
We still have that bottle of wine.

329
00:19:46,324 --> 00:19:48,713
Are you in the mood for. . .

330
00:19:48,962 --> 00:19:50,031
. . .something grape?

331
00:19:50,241 --> 00:19:53,358
-Sure, that would be good.
-All right.

332
00:20:03,071 --> 00:20:06,108
The neighbors must be vacuuming.

333
00:20:12,184 --> 00:20:14,095
Well, as long as we're. . .

334
00:20:14,302 --> 00:20:15,496
. . .here. . .

335
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,897
. . .and not on the subject. . . .

336
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:22,294
I was thinking about. . .

337
00:20:24,574 --> 00:20:27,452
. . .how mad we got
at each other before.

338
00:20:31,089 --> 00:20:34,399
And I was thinking maybe
it was partially because of how we--

339
00:20:34,926 --> 00:20:36,723
-Rachel?
-Barry?

340
00:20:36,925 --> 00:20:40,235
I can't. I can't do it.
I can't marry Mindy.

341
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:43,638
I'm still in love with you.

342
00:20:48,716 --> 00:20:52,072
We have got to start
locking that door!

343
00:21:00,706 --> 00:21:04,699
This is me in The Sound of Music.
You see the von Trapp kids?

344
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:06,815
Because I'm in front of them.

345
00:21:07,501 --> 00:21:09,651
I thought that was an alp.

346
00:21:10,339 --> 00:21:12,136
High school was not
my favorite time.

347
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:14,248
I don't know.
I loved high school.

348
00:21:14,456 --> 00:21:18,165
It was just like four years
of parties and dating and sex and--

349
00:21:18,493 --> 00:21:21,565
Well, I went to boarding school
with 400 boys.

350
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:24,927
Any sex I had would've involved
a major lifestyle choice.

351
00:21:27,646 --> 00:21:30,240
Doesn't it seem like
a million years ago?

352
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,637
My butt cheek is waking up!
