00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,318
-Hi, guys.
-Hey, Phoebe.

2
00:00:05,554 --> 00:00:06,748
How did it go?

3
00:00:06,989 --> 00:00:07,819
Not so good.

4
00:00:08,025 --> 00:00:11,222
He walked me home and said,
''We should do this again. ''

5
00:00:11,931 --> 00:00:14,764
He said, ''We should do it again. ''
That's good, right?

6
00:00:15,001 --> 00:00:17,834
Loosely translated,
''We should do this again,'' means:

7
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,026
''You will never see me naked. ''

8
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:22,407
Since when?

9
00:00:22,654 --> 00:00:25,771
Since always.
It's, like, ''dating'' language.

10
00:00:26,003 --> 00:00:28,961
Like, ''It's not you,''
means, ''It is you. ''

11
00:00:30,387 --> 00:00:34,062
''You're nice,'' means, ''I'll be
dating leather-clad alcoholics. . .

12
00:00:34,254 --> 00:00:36,529
. . .and complaining
about them to you. ''

13
00:00:37,044 --> 00:00:39,558
''I think we should see
other people,'' means:

14
00:00:39,795 --> 00:00:41,194
''Ha, ha, I already am! ''

15
00:00:42,585 --> 00:00:43,938
Everybody knows this?

16
00:00:44,937 --> 00:00:46,006
Cushions the blow.

17
00:00:46,252 --> 00:00:48,482
Like your parents
putting the dog to sleep. . .

18
00:00:48,724 --> 00:00:50,794
. . .and saying it went to
live on a farm.

19
00:00:51,155 --> 00:00:54,306
That's funny. Because our
parents actually did. . .

20
00:00:54,544 --> 00:00:57,456
. . .send our dog off to live on a farm.

21
00:00:58,211 --> 00:00:59,644
Ross. . .?

22
00:01:01,121 --> 00:01:03,681
Hello! The Milner's farm
in Connecticut?

23
00:01:03,911 --> 00:01:06,141
The Milners had this
unbelievable farm.

24
00:01:06,383 --> 00:01:08,772
They had horses and
rabbits to chase.

25
00:01:09,013 --> 00:01:10,366
And it was. . . .

26
00:01:13,279 --> 00:01:15,588
Oh, my God! Chi-Chi!

27
00:01:17,743 --> 00:01:19,779
The One With the Thumb

00:02:11,477 --> 00:02:14,230
''How does it feel knowing
you're about to die?''

30
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,664
Warden, in five minutes
my pain will be over.

31
00:02:17,895 --> 00:02:22,491
But you'll live with the knowledge
that you sent an honest man to die.

32
00:02:23,635 --> 00:02:25,273
That was really good!

33
00:02:25,787 --> 00:02:27,539
Thanks. Let's keep going.

34
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,574
''So, what do you want
from me, Dimon? Huh?''

35
00:02:33,999 --> 00:02:37,753
I just wanna go back to my cell,
because in my cell I can smoke.

36
00:02:37,985 --> 00:02:38,861
''Smoke away! ''

37
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:55,726
I think this is probably why Dimon
smokes in his cell alone.

38
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,551
-What?
-Relax your hand.

39
00:02:58,793 --> 00:03:00,465
Let your wrist go.

40
00:03:00,706 --> 00:03:01,616
Not so much.

41
00:03:03,855 --> 00:03:05,811
All right. Now try taking a puff.

42
00:03:06,287 --> 00:03:07,800
Right.

43
00:03:09,436 --> 00:03:10,312
Give it to me.

44
00:03:10,552 --> 00:03:12,747
I'm not giving you a cigarette.

45
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:16,181
It's fine. Do you want to
get this part or not?

46
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,768
All right. Now, don't think
of it as a cigarette.

47
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:23,753
Think of it as the thing that
has been missing from your hand.

48
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,739
When you're holding it, you feel right.

49
00:03:26,975 --> 00:03:28,124
You feel complete.

50
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,246
You miss it?

51
00:03:29,486 --> 00:03:30,919
No, not so much.

52
00:03:32,596 --> 00:03:34,712
All right. Now we smoke.

53
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:39,688
Oh, my God!

54
00:03:48,501 --> 00:03:51,777
It's the same as the distance
from the tip of a guy's thumb. . .

55
00:03:52,008 --> 00:03:54,238
. . .to the tip of his index finger.

56
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,453
That's ridiculous.

57
00:04:02,811 --> 00:04:04,290
Can I use either thumb?

58
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,190
All right. Don't tell me.

59
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:12,181
Decaf cappuccino for Joey.

60
00:04:13,813 --> 00:04:15,565
Coffee, black.

61
00:04:16,563 --> 00:04:17,712
Latte.

62
00:04:19,752 --> 00:04:20,901
And an iced tea.

63
00:04:21,147 --> 00:04:22,466
I'm getting good at this.

64
00:04:22,702 --> 00:04:23,498
Excellent!

65
00:04:24,655 --> 00:04:25,883
Good for me!

66
00:04:39,165 --> 00:04:39,961
You okay, Phoebe?

67
00:04:40,201 --> 00:04:41,680
It's not even worth--

68
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:43,268
It's my bank.

69
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,659
What did they do?

70
00:04:45,742 --> 00:04:49,496
I'm going through my mail, and I
open up their monthly ''statement. ''

71
00:04:49,728 --> 00:04:50,843
Easy!

72
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:55,477
And there's $500 extra in my account.

73
00:04:56,026 --> 00:04:58,620
Satan's minions at work again!

74
00:04:59,335 --> 00:05:01,724
Now I have to go down there
and deal with them--

75
00:05:01,966 --> 00:05:03,684
What are you talking about?
Keep it!

76
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:04,988
It's not mine.

77
00:05:05,195 --> 00:05:07,709
If I kept it, it would be
like stealing.

78
00:05:07,945 --> 00:05:11,301
Yeah, but if you spent it,
it would be like shopping.

79
00:05:13,765 --> 00:05:15,756
Say I bought
a great pair of shoes.

80
00:05:15,957 --> 00:05:18,073
Know what I'd hear
with every step I took?

81
00:05:18,309 --> 00:05:20,777
''Not mine. Not mine. Not mine. ''

82
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,580
And even if I was happy
and skipping. . .

83
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:26,802
. . .I'd hear, ''Not-not mine.
Not-not mine. ''

84
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,597
We're with you. We got it.

85
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,663
I'd never be able to enjoy it.
It'd be like this giant karmic debt.

86
00:05:33,855 --> 00:05:35,493
Chandler, what are you doing?

87
00:05:36,287 --> 00:05:37,879
What are you doing?

88
00:05:40,871 --> 00:05:42,862
Oh, gross!

89
00:05:43,502 --> 00:05:44,412
What is this?

90
00:05:44,658 --> 00:05:45,852
I'm smoking! I'm smoking!

91
00:05:46,093 --> 00:05:48,448
You've been so good for three years!

92
00:05:48,684 --> 00:05:51,039
And this is my reward.

93
00:05:52,431 --> 00:05:55,628
Just think about what you went
through the last time you quit.

94
00:05:55,859 --> 00:05:57,656
So this time I won't quit.

95
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,168
All right! I'm putting it out!

96
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,793
Oh, no!

97
00:06:03,034 --> 00:06:04,990
I can't drink this now.

98
00:06:08,854 --> 00:06:10,890
I'm gonna go change.
I've got a date.

99
00:06:11,126 --> 00:06:13,435
Is this Alan again?
How's it going?

100
00:06:13,677 --> 00:06:17,590
It's going pretty good.
It's nice and we're having fun.

101
00:06:17,823 --> 00:06:19,575
When do we get to meet the guy?

102
00:06:19,776 --> 00:06:21,528
Let's see, today's Monday. . . .

103
00:06:21,769 --> 00:06:23,122
Never!

104
00:06:23,603 --> 00:06:25,514
Not after what happened with Steve.

105
00:06:25,715 --> 00:06:26,670
What do you mean?

106
00:06:26,911 --> 00:06:30,062
We love Steve. Steve was sexy!

107
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:33,800
Sorry.

108
00:06:34,047 --> 00:06:37,039
I don't know how I feel about him.
Let me figure it out.

109
00:06:37,236 --> 00:06:38,305
Then can we meet him?

110
00:06:40,345 --> 00:06:41,858
Sorry.

111
00:06:45,288 --> 00:06:46,767
Why should they meet him?

112
00:06:47,002 --> 00:06:49,755
I bring a guy home and they're
all over him like. . .

113
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:53,627
. . .coyotes picking off the weak
members of the herd.

114
00:06:54,217 --> 00:06:58,449
Listen, as someone who's seen
more than her share of bad beef. . .

115
00:06:58,681 --> 00:07:02,230
. . .I'll tell you, that is not
such a terrible thing.

116
00:07:02,468 --> 00:07:04,823
Your friends are just
looking out after you.

117
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:08,210
I wish that once I'd
bring a guy home they actually liked.

118
00:07:08,447 --> 00:07:11,883
You realize the odds of that
happening are a little slimmer. . .

119
00:07:12,115 --> 00:07:14,345
. . .if they never get to meet the guy.

120
00:07:15,742 --> 00:07:16,731
Let it go, Ross.

121
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,134
You didn't know Chi-Chi.

122
00:07:23,077 --> 00:07:24,146
Do you all promise?

123
00:07:24,392 --> 00:07:26,952
Yeah, we promise.
We'll be good.

124
00:07:27,143 --> 00:07:29,896
Chandler, do you promise to be good?

125
00:07:37,347 --> 00:07:41,306
You can come in, but your filter
tip little buddy stays outside!

126
00:07:50,621 --> 00:07:51,770
''Dear Ms. Buffay:

127
00:07:52,016 --> 00:07:53,529
Thank you for calling.

128
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:57,809
We have credited your account $500.
We're sorry for the inconvenience. . .

129
00:07:57,996 --> 00:08:00,794
. . .and hope you'll accept
this football phone. . .

130
00:08:03,855 --> 00:08:05,766
. . .as our gift. ''
Do you believe it?

131
00:08:06,008 --> 00:08:09,080
Now I have $ 1 000
and a football phone.

132
00:08:10,672 --> 00:08:12,947
What bank is this?

133
00:08:13,821 --> 00:08:15,732
Okay, it's him.

134
00:08:17,408 --> 00:08:18,443
-Who is it?
-Alan.

135
00:08:18,684 --> 00:08:20,276
Chandler! He's here!

136
00:08:23,268 --> 00:08:25,099
Please be good. Please?

137
00:08:25,779 --> 00:08:28,293
Just remember how much
you all like me.

138
00:08:30,682 --> 00:08:33,116
Alan, this is everybody.
Everybody, this is Alan.

139
00:08:37,897 --> 00:08:40,650
I've heard so much about
all you guys.

140
00:08:47,544 --> 00:08:49,216
I'll call you tomorrow.

141
00:08:53,643 --> 00:08:56,794
Let's let the Alan-bashing begin.

142
00:08:57,071 --> 00:08:58,823
Who's gonna take the first shot?

143
00:09:00,618 --> 00:09:01,812
Come on!

144
00:09:02,651 --> 00:09:03,970
I'll go.

145
00:09:06,598 --> 00:09:08,987
Let's start with the way he
kept picking at--

146
00:09:09,229 --> 00:09:10,548
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

147
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:12,136
Can't do it. We loved him.

148
00:09:12,378 --> 00:09:13,572
We loved him!

149
00:09:13,813 --> 00:09:14,848
Wait a minute!

150
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:17,522
We're talking about someone
I'm going out with?

151
00:09:18,118 --> 00:09:19,790
And did you notice?

152
00:09:24,775 --> 00:09:27,608
Know what was great?
The way his smile was crooked.

153
00:09:27,844 --> 00:09:29,641
Yes! Like the man in the shoe!

154
00:09:30,475 --> 00:09:31,544
What shoe?

155
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,180
From the nursery rhyme.

156
00:09:34,421 --> 00:09:36,491
''There was a crooked man
with a crooked smile. . .

157
00:09:36,733 --> 00:09:39,293
. . .who lived in a shoe for a while. . . . ''

158
00:09:42,194 --> 00:09:44,025
So I think Alan. . .

159
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:48,579
. . .is the yardstick against which all
future boyfriends will be measured.

160
00:09:48,811 --> 00:09:49,926
What future boyfriends?

161
00:09:50,167 --> 00:09:53,204
-I think this could be, you know, ''it. ''
-Really?

162
00:09:53,435 --> 00:09:57,189
I'd marry him for his
David Hasselhoff impression alone.

163
00:09:57,461 --> 00:09:59,770
You know I'll be doing that
at parties, right?

164
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,954
-Know what I like most about him?
-What?

165
00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:09,746
The way he makes me feel about myself.

166
00:10:30,786 --> 00:10:31,821
How was the game?

167
00:10:33,138 --> 00:10:34,457
Well. . . .

168
00:10:34,812 --> 00:10:36,450
We won!

169
00:10:37,881 --> 00:10:40,714
Fantastic! One question:
How is that possible?

170
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,858
-Alan.
-He was unbelievable!

171
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,450
He was like a Bugs Bunny cartoon
where Bugs plays every position.

172
00:10:47,687 --> 00:10:50,997
But instead of Bugs, it was 1 st
base, Alan. 2nd base, Alan. . . .

173
00:10:54,464 --> 00:10:57,820
It was like he made us into a team.

174
00:10:58,051 --> 00:11:02,363
We sure showed those Hasidic jewelers
a thing or two about softball.

175
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:05,423
Can I ask you guys a question?

176
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,980
Do you think Alan
is maybe sometimes--

177
00:11:08,216 --> 00:11:09,126
What?

178
00:11:09,372 --> 00:11:11,840
I don't know. A little too ''Alan''?

179
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:15,393
Oh, no. That's not possible.
You can never be too ''Alan. ''

180
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:19,623
It's his innate ''Alan-ness''
that we adore.

181
00:11:20,374 --> 00:11:22,490
I, personally, could have
a gallon of Alan.

182
00:11:28,227 --> 00:11:29,262
Hey, Lizzy.

183
00:11:29,462 --> 00:11:30,781
Hey, Weird Girl.

184
00:11:30,977 --> 00:11:33,855
-I bought alphabet soup.
-Did you pick out the vowels?

185
00:11:34,046 --> 00:11:36,844
I left in the Y's.
Because ''--sometimes Y. ''

186
00:11:38,112 --> 00:11:39,181
And something else.

187
00:11:39,428 --> 00:11:40,383
Saltines?

188
00:11:40,624 --> 00:11:42,819
Would you like $ 1 000
and a football phone?

189
00:11:43,374 --> 00:11:44,602
What?

190
00:11:45,766 --> 00:11:47,279
Oh, my God!

191
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,114
-There's really money in here.
-I know.

192
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,903
What are you doing?

193
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:54,783
I want you to have it.
I don't want it.

194
00:11:55,213 --> 00:11:56,965
I have to give you something.

195
00:11:57,206 --> 00:11:58,719
No, it's fine. You don't--

196
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,791
Do you want my tinfoil hat?

197
00:12:01,033 --> 00:12:03,706
No, you need that.
It's okay. Thanks.

198
00:12:03,943 --> 00:12:06,138
Please. Let me do something.

199
00:12:06,534 --> 00:12:10,447
I'll tell you what. You buy me
a soda and we're even. Okay?

200
00:13:11,867 --> 00:13:13,505
Keep the change.

201
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:14,930
Thanks, Lizzy.

202
00:13:15,176 --> 00:13:16,325
Want a pretzel?

203
00:13:16,571 --> 00:13:19,483
-No, I'm fine. Thanks.
-See you.

204
00:13:26,935 --> 00:13:27,731
A thumb?

205
00:13:30,244 --> 00:13:32,394
I know. I opened it
and there it was. . .

206
00:13:32,635 --> 00:13:35,786
. . .floating in there, like
this tiny little hitchhiker.

207
00:13:37,618 --> 00:13:40,132
Maybe it's a contest?
Like ''Collect all five. ''

208
00:13:42,561 --> 00:13:43,755
Does anyone wanna see?

209
00:13:43,996 --> 00:13:45,270
No, thanks!

210
00:13:47,145 --> 00:13:48,624
Don't do that. Come on!

211
00:13:48,859 --> 00:13:50,212
It's worse than the thumb.

212
00:13:52,407 --> 00:13:53,681
This is so unfair.

213
00:13:53,922 --> 00:13:55,241
Why is it unfair?

214
00:13:55,476 --> 00:13:58,070
So I have a flaw! Big deal!

215
00:13:58,306 --> 00:14:00,820
Joey's constant knuckle-
cracking isn't annoying?

216
00:14:01,057 --> 00:14:03,093
And Ross, over-pronouncing
every word.

217
00:14:03,329 --> 00:14:05,524
And Monica, who snorts
when she laughs.

218
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,910
I mean, what the hell
is that thing?

219
00:14:09,547 --> 00:14:12,698
I accept those flaws.
Why can't you accept me for this?

220
00:14:19,553 --> 00:14:22,670
Does the knuckle-cracking
bother everybody, or just him?

221
00:14:26,409 --> 00:14:28,081
I could live without it.

222
00:14:30,834 --> 00:14:35,225
Is it like, a little annoying? Or
is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?

223
00:14:38,049 --> 00:14:41,041
Don't listen to him, Pheebs.
I think it's endearing.

224
00:14:41,277 --> 00:14:43,393
Oh, you do, do you?

225
00:14:49,329 --> 00:14:52,321
There's nothing wrong with
speaking correctly.

226
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,152
lndeed there isn't.

227
00:14:57,182 --> 00:14:58,900
I should get back to work.

228
00:14:59,135 --> 00:15:02,332
Otherwise someone might
get what they actually ordered.

229
00:15:04,716 --> 00:15:07,469
The hair comes out
and the gloves come off.

230
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:25,645
Did you ever go out with a guy
your friends all really like?

231
00:15:26,042 --> 00:15:27,031
No.

232
00:15:28,633 --> 00:15:32,421
Well, I'm going out with a guy
my friends all really like.

233
00:15:33,815 --> 00:15:36,204
Are we talking about the coyotes here?

234
00:15:36,446 --> 00:15:39,597
All right! A cow got through.

235
00:15:40,632 --> 00:15:41,951
Can you believe it?

236
00:15:42,186 --> 00:15:43,744
It's just, you know what?

237
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,613
I just don't feel the ''thing. ''

238
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:49,278
They feel the thing.
I don't feel the thing.

239
00:15:49,521 --> 00:15:52,240
Honey, you should always. . .

240
00:15:52,431 --> 00:15:54,069
. . .feel the thing.

241
00:15:56,536 --> 00:15:59,573
If that's how you feel about
the guy, dump him.

242
00:15:59,805 --> 00:16:01,363
It's gonna be really hard.

243
00:16:01,599 --> 00:16:03,351
He's a big boy.
He'll get over it.

244
00:16:03,592 --> 00:16:07,904
No, he'll be fine. It's the other
five I'm worried about.

245
00:16:08,654 --> 00:16:10,246
Don't you respect your body?

246
00:16:10,488 --> 00:16:12,126
Don't you see what you're doing?

247
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,676
I've had it with you
and your cancer. . .

248
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:16,670
. . .emphysema and heart disease.

249
00:16:16,866 --> 00:16:20,256
The bottom line is smoking is cool,
and you know it.

250
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,872
Alan wants to speak to you.

251
00:16:26,114 --> 00:16:27,832
Really? He does?

252
00:16:29,343 --> 00:16:31,220
Hey, buddy! What's up?

253
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,040
She told you about that, huh?

254
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,589
Well, yeah. I have one now
and then. Well, yeah, now.

255
00:16:40,663 --> 00:16:42,176
It's not that bad--

256
00:16:44,331 --> 00:16:46,162
Well, that's true.

257
00:16:48,397 --> 00:16:52,356
Gee, no one's ever put it
like that before.

258
00:16:52,622 --> 00:16:54,533
Well, okay. Thanks.

259
00:17:04,381 --> 00:17:05,450
God, he's good.

260
00:17:07,132 --> 00:17:08,531
If only he were a woman.

261
00:17:15,542 --> 00:17:16,895
Oh, Lamb Chop!

262
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:19,651
How old is that sock?

263
00:17:20,525 --> 00:17:24,234
If I had a sock on my hand
for 30 years, it'd be talking too.

264
00:17:25,787 --> 00:17:30,224
I think it's time to change
somebody's nicotine patch.

265
00:17:33,999 --> 00:17:34,795
Where's Joey?

266
00:17:35,035 --> 00:17:37,913
Joey ate my last stick
of gum, so I killed him.

267
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,376
Do you think that was wrong?

268
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:44,247
I think he's across the hall.

269
00:17:46,037 --> 00:17:47,550
There you go.

270
00:17:48,229 --> 00:17:50,459
Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.

271
00:17:51,418 --> 00:17:53,932
Pheebs, do you want
the rest of that Pop Tart?

272
00:17:56,002 --> 00:17:58,516
Does anyone want
the rest of this Pop Tart?

273
00:18:00,188 --> 00:18:01,701
Hey, I might.

274
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:04,092
I'm sorry.

275
00:18:04,573 --> 00:18:07,929
Those stupid soda people gave
me $ 7000 for the thumb.

276
00:18:09,954 --> 00:18:12,343
And on my way over here
I stepped in gum.

277
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,976
What is up with the universe?

278
00:18:16,212 --> 00:18:17,122
What's going on?

279
00:18:17,368 --> 00:18:19,882
Nothing. I think it's nice
when we're together.

280
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:23,236
It's even nicer when everyone
gets to wear their underwear.

281
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,264
Please, guys, we have to talk.

282
00:18:35,465 --> 00:18:36,261
Wait, wait!

283
00:18:36,502 --> 00:18:38,174
I'm getting a déjà vu.

284
00:18:38,415 --> 00:18:39,564
No, I'm not.

285
00:18:42,242 --> 00:18:43,231
We have to talk.

286
00:18:43,478 --> 00:18:44,354
There it is!

287
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:49,375
It's about Alan.

288
00:18:50,135 --> 00:18:52,126
There's something you should know.

289
00:18:53,603 --> 00:18:56,720
There's really no
easy way to say this.

290
00:18:58,386 --> 00:19:00,775
I've decided to break up with Alan.

291
00:19:05,162 --> 00:19:06,880
Is there somebody else?

292
00:19:10,265 --> 00:19:11,254
It's just. . .

293
00:19:11,461 --> 00:19:14,294
. . .you know, things change.
People change.

294
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,646
We didn't change.

295
00:19:18,835 --> 00:19:20,712
So that's it? It's over?

296
00:19:22,343 --> 00:19:23,617
Just like that?

297
00:19:24,695 --> 00:19:29,405
You let your guard down. You start
to care about someone, and I just--

298
00:19:32,906 --> 00:19:35,625
-I can go on pretending--
-Okay!

299
00:19:36,813 --> 00:19:39,532
That wouldn't be fair to me,
to Alan, or to you.

300
00:19:39,962 --> 00:19:41,953
Well, who wants fair?

301
00:19:42,154 --> 00:19:45,749
I just want things back, you know,
the way they were.

302
00:19:47,615 --> 00:19:48,411
I'm sorry.

303
00:19:48,652 --> 00:19:51,530
Oh, she's sorry.
I feel better.

304
00:19:53,196 --> 00:19:54,549
I just can't believe this!

305
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:59,102
With the holidays coming up.
I wanted him to meet my family.

306
00:20:00,451 --> 00:20:03,284
I'll meet someone else.
There'll be other Alans.

307
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,555
Yeah, right!

308
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,858
Are you guys gonna be okay?

309
00:20:11,054 --> 00:20:12,646
We'll be fine.

310
00:20:12,848 --> 00:20:15,282
We're just gonna need a little time.

311
00:20:16,116 --> 00:20:17,834
I understand.

312
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:25,118
I'm really sorry.

313
00:20:25,364 --> 00:20:28,003
I mean, I'm sorry too.

314
00:20:28,593 --> 00:20:30,584
But I'm a little relieved.

315
00:20:30,825 --> 00:20:31,655
Relieved?

316
00:20:32,021 --> 00:20:35,172
Well, l mean, l had
a great time with you.

317
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:38,157
I just can't stand your friends.

318
00:20:44,817 --> 00:20:48,127
Remember when we went to
Central Park and rented boats?

319
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:51,518
That was fun.

320
00:20:53,387 --> 00:20:55,503
He could row like a Viking.

321
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:04,786
So how'd it go?

322
00:21:06,661 --> 00:21:07,457
You know.

323
00:21:07,698 --> 00:21:09,450
Did he mention us?

324
00:21:14,634 --> 00:21:17,228
He says he's really gonna
miss you guys.

325
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:24,632
Rough day, huh?

326
00:21:24,878 --> 00:21:26,197
You have no idea.

327
00:21:26,393 --> 00:21:27,792
Come here.

328
00:21:30,977 --> 00:21:32,968
That's it.
I'm getting cigarettes.

329
00:21:33,727 --> 00:21:34,603
I don't care!

330
00:21:34,843 --> 00:21:37,801
I'm weak! I've gotta smoke!
I've gotta have the smoke!

331
00:21:37,993 --> 00:21:40,985
If you never smoke again,
I'll give you $ 7000.

332
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,133
Yeah, all right.
