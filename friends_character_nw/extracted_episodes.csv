1001,"The way you crushed Mike at Ping-Pong was such a turn-on. You wanna...? You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired. - I'll put a pillowcase over my head. - You're on. - Hey. - What's up? Well, Mike's taking a shower, which, by the way, there's no law against. And then we're gonna grab some food. So if you want... - Finally. - Is that Ross? Yeah. You can hear everything through these stupid walls. - Sounds like he's with someone. - He could be alone. This morning I heard him do pushups and then talk to his triceps. Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right. Yeah, I hear someone else in there with him. - Dr. Geller! - God, you're amazing. I didn't even have to ask you to call me that. - Oh, my God, that's Charlie! - She's cheating on Joey with Ross! Oh, that tart! Floozy! Giant! - I'm not sure about this. - Yeah, you're right. This is none of our business. I'm not sure it's the best way to hear everything. Get me a glass! No, I'm not gonna do this, okay? I'm not gonna eavesdrop on my friend. I love Barbados. I can't believe I'm kissing you. I'm kissing Rachel! I know. I'm her. Rachel and Joey! It's Rachel and Joey! - What? - Get over here! Oh, my God! I love how thin these walls are! Thank you. The One After Joey and Rachel Kiss Hey, before, you said that nothing could happen between us. What changed? Well, I only said that because of Ross. - And then I saw him kissing Charlie. - What? Ross and Charlie? Wow! She's really making her way through the group, huh? - Eh, who am I to talk? - Yeah. I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey? How about the dinosaur twins in the other room? - No one is manning that wall! - I'm on it! - Anything? - I think I hear curtains closing. We've got shoes being kicked off over here. Bedsprings! Unmistakable! - You realize that's your brother. - Not until you said it. Somebody switch! Wow! Wait a minute. Ross and Charlie. Joey and Rachel. Phoebe and Mike. We're the only ones leaving with the person we came with! That's not true. I came with Monica, I'm leaving with Weird Al. Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. - Tomorrow I'm going to the salon. - Okay, Buckwheat. You gotta hear this, it's great! It's like free porn. - Is everything okay? - It's just... I don't think I can do this. Oh, is it because of what might be on the bed? - I saw that report, with the infrared... - No! No. No. Look, I need to talk to Joey. I mean, you guys just broke up. Before anything more happens between us, I need to know he's okay with it. - I completely understand. - All right, I'm gonna go find him. I just need a second before I can, you know... Grandma, Grandma, Grandma. - Okay, I'll see you later. - Okay! That's the door. He's gone. And she's turning on the TV... ...and watching <i>Miss Congeniality</i>. Honey? If you know it through a wall, you know it too well. Hey, what are you guys doing? We're just... We're sad to go, so we're just saying goodbye to the hotel. I love you... ...Paradise Hotel Golf Resort and Spa. Yeah. We had a great time, thank you. Bye. Okay. Hey, have you guys seen Joey anywhere? He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend, Charlie. That's the situation as we know it. If you see him, could you tell him I'm looking for him? - You got it. - Thanks. Thank you. Other wall, people! Other wall! - Rach, you there? - Oh, my God, that's Ross! - What are we gonna do? - Okay, just be calm. For all he knows, we're just hanging out. All right? So just be nonchalant. - That's not nonchalant! - No idea what it means. Okay, just hide. - Rach? - Coming! Try under the bed. There's no room under the bed... - Is everything okay? - Yeah. - Hey. Do you know where Joey is? - Hi. I really don't. - Can I talk to you for a minute? - Yeah. Sure. I don't believe this. Have you guys been...? This is the listening side of the wall. Then she told me that she and Joey had broken up... ...and part of the reason was she had feelings for me. Right. Yeah. You know I've wanted to ask Charlie out since the day I met her. Oh, I know, I know. That's been really hard for you. Anyway, one thing led to another, and... ...before you know it, we were kissing. How angry do you think Joey's gonna be? That is hard to say, Ross. That is hard to say. I gotta find him. He's gotta be here someplace. You would think. Joey? - Is he gone? - How are you doing this? What? Hey! What are you...? What is this? Have you been listening this entire time? Yeah! Now, what is this? What is this? Well, let's see. We kissed for 10 minutes... ...and now we're talking to our friends about it, so I guess this is sixth grade. No, no. Have you thought about how complicated this could get? - What about Ross? - Well, he's with Charlie now. Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you? You're a pain in my ass, Geller. Look, we appreciate all the advice... ...but this is between Joey and me. We can handle it. We'll go. Will you do one thing for us, the people that care about you? - Sure. - Enunciate. Get out! Are they right? Probably, yeah. I mean, maybe we should... ...hold off until we talk to Ross. Yeah. Yeah. We can wait. We don't have to do anything tonight. Yeah, I think that would be best. So, I'm gonna... I'm gonna take off. - Although... - I like ""although."" I mean, you know... Ross and I haven't dated in, like... ...six years. Six years? Wow. That's almost as long as high school. Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now. Absolutely. - He's not thinking about you. - No. I'm thinking about you. Yeah. - Let's forget about Ross. - It's forgotten. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Seriously, what is it? Nothing. It's really... It's nothing. Come here. Come here. What's wrong? Sorry, I just... I can't seem to get Ross out of my head. Well, maybe I can help. Your lips are so soft. Do that again. Yeah, we need to talk to Ross. Yeah. Hey. You guys ready to go? Not quite. Monica's at the salon, and I'm finishing packing. Dude, you're not taking your Bible? You're not supposed to take that. Besides, it's a New Testament. What are you gonna do with it? Learn about Jesus. - Hey! - So did you talk to Joey? No. I couldn't find him. I'm just gonna talk to him on the plane. Okay. Sounds like a good idea, Dr. Geller. Stop it. Ph.D. You're filthy. - Hey. Have you guys seen Monica? - Actually, I think she went to the salon. Oh, yeah. Oh, she went to the salon, all right. Check it out! Whose day just got better? Chandler! Hey! - What do you think? - I think... I think I can see your scalp. Don't you just love it? Yeah. Yeah, you got shellfish in your head. It's something. You go, girlfriend. - You never said that in your life. - Not once. - I thought so. - Oh, and listen to this. What do you know? It's a treat for the eyes and the ears. Wow, it's kind of weird that I'm sitting next to Charlie after we broke up. Yeah. It's almost as if Air Barbados doesn't care about your social life. Does someone mind switching and sitting with Charlie? Oh, I mean, l... Dude, I spent the whole conference with Charlie. - I understand. - No, I'll do it. Wish I could switch. I really don't want to sit with Allen Iverson over there. Once we're in the air and the captain turns off the seat belt sign... ...you feel free to roam about my cabin. And you should be careful when checking your overhead bins. - Because items may shift during... - Oh, you're not good at this. - Do you have to go home tonight? - No, I think I could come over. It's Saturday, right? What? - I can't do anything tonight. - Why not? I have a date. - You have a date? With who? - Oh, it's my girlfriend. - You have a girlfriend? - Yeah. Well, when you and I broke up, I started seeing someone. - Well, for how long? - Three months. Three months? Okay. This is none of my business, but how long are you gonna keep seeing her? I'll tell her that it's over tonight at dinner. I promise. Oh, okay, good. You do that. When you get home, maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you. Maybe I'll sign for it, tear it open. - Pull out the packing material... - We'll have sex. Let's leave it there. All right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the right time. He's in a good mood after the flight attendant says ""duty-free."" Okay. Good luck. Ross is coming over. I think now would be a good time to talk to him. I guess so. I'm just... I'm really nervous. Well, keep in mind that by the time you're done... ...they'll probably be serving dinner. Still nervous? I'm gonna get the lasagna. - Hey, Rach? - Yeah? - Do you mind if I sit here for a sec? - Yeah. Yeah, sure. Yeah. <i>Good luck.</i> - Hey. - Hey. So I... I kind of need to talk to you about Charlie. - Yeah? - Last night, after you guys broke up... So sorry to hear about that, by the way. Well, Charlie and I were talking, and... Well... You kissed. Wh... What? What? What would give you that idea? - I saw you. - Yeah, we kissed. But nothing else. Nothing else happened, okay? - Ross, Ross, Ross. It's okay. - What? It's okay. You know, look... ...I totally understand, all right? You guys... ...make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know? And... - I want you to be happy. - Are you serious? Yeah. - Now I have something... - I am speechless. I mean, the fact that you would put my happiness first like that, I mean... You're an incredible friend, do you know that? - Well, look, before you go... - No, I mean it. I mean, you're so loyal, man. And selfless and generous. I am those things, yeah. I've known Chandler longer, so I think of him as my best friend. But now... ...I may have to rethink some stuff. Dude! Hey, if there is ever anything I can do for you... I can't think of anything. - Thanks. - Yeah. - So hi. - Hi. - So you talked to Joey? - Oh, yeah. We had a really good talk. - Oh, that's great. - Yeah. - So everything's okay? - Oh, no, it's great. - It's great. He's an amazing guy. - Oh, well, obviously, I think so too. Well, I'm so excited about this. Really? Excited? What, are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams about this. Excuse me. You didn't tell him, did you? I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take them back. I'm gonna edge out Chandler! Fine. Forget it. When we go back to New York, I will tell him. Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that. - Hi, Mike's place. - Hey, it's Mike. - That was fast. - <i>Oh, no, she's not here yet.</i> You know, I'm just gonna take off and break up with her over the phone. You can't do that. Oh, come on, Mike, strap on a pair. Why don't you tell her that we got back together. Women appreciate honesty. We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while, just FYI. One more thing. There might be a picture of Precious on my coffee table. Her name's Precious? Is she a pure breed, or did you pick her up at the pound? <i>- I just want to give you a heads up.</i> - Okay. And if she gets upset... ...just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snap. Hi. I'm Precious. Who are you? - I'm Phoebe. - Phoebe? Mike's ex-girlfriend, Phoebe? The love of his life? That Phoebe? Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these! - You go back to work tomorrow night? - Yeah. So if you want people to see them... ...you're not having them taken out, say, at the break of dawn? Well, if I had them taken out, then I wouldn't be able to do this. You like that, right? - What are you singing? - It's ""Bolero"" from <i>10.</i> It's ""Ride of the Valkyries"" from <i>Apocalypse Now.</i> Here's the thing. The cornrows were a solution to your frizzy-hair problem. Now that we're home, you don't have that problem. If you think about it... I hate them. - What? You said you liked them. - Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was that I could see your scalp. Well, fine. So you don't like them. Everybody else does. Again, let's journey back. As I recall, Rachel said she had never noticed the shape of your skull before. And Joey? Well, Joey didn't realize there was anything different. You know what? I don't care. I like it, and I'm gonna keep it. You're just jealous because your hair can't do this. - Get yourself in the tooth? - And the eye. Hi! There she is! Hi, Emma. Oh, my God, I missed you. Oh, Emma, I missed you so much. Hi. Did you have a good time with Grandma Greene? Huh? Did she give you a bottle of antidepressants again to use as a rattle? That was one time, Ross, and they were only, like, five milligrams. Hey, Emma, Daddy has some presents for you, okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here, sweetie. Ross, actually, there's something that I really need to talk to you about. Okay, shoot. - Okay. All right, here's the deal. - Oh, no! - What is it? - Oh, major shampoo explosion! - Look, Ross, this really isn't easy. - Oh, it's all over everything! Why? Why me? Because you took 300 bottles of shampoo? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You were saying? - Well, yeah. Look, it's about me and... - Oh, not another one! Oh, my God... Oh, and this is moisturizer! It's even harder to clean! Why? Why do bad things happen to good people? - Wow. Clearly this is not a good time. - You think? Okay. Bye. All right, so Mike's on his way over. You thought you were meeting here, he thought at the restaurant, so... It doesn't matter who's right or wrong. The point is, I'm gonna take off. Wait. I'm not letting you leave until you tell me what's going on. I mean... ...are you guys getting back together or something? All right. Susie... Can I call you Susie? My name is Precious. I can't say that. Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you. Mike and I are back together. And unfortunately... ...that effectively ends your relationship with him. He's very sorry about that, and wishes you the best luck in all your endeavors. I just can't believe this. Why? - Well, I don't... - Why would he do this? - What's wrong with me? - There's nothing wrong with you. What the hell am I supposed to do now? Damn it, woman! Pull yourself together! Have some pride, for the love of God! Okay, not a fan of the tough love. I just can't believe that Mike didn't give me any warning. He didn't know. He wasn't planning on coming to Barbados and proposing to me. He proposed to you? This is the worst birthday ever! Look, Precious... Mike's not worth this. You're an attractive, intelligent woman... ...and let's face it, Mike's kind of a wang. He proposed to me while he was still seeing you. He was gonna break up with you on your birthday? I don't like to kiss and tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend. Oh, my God, you know, maybe you're right. Maybe I don't need him. I deserve to be treated with respect. Screw you, Mike. You're a coward and a bastard, and I hope you rot in hell! You're welcome. Honey? You've been in there for a long time. Is everything okay? Not really. I have a problem. Really? What happened? Well, I was dancing around and singing ""No Woman, No Cry""... ...and I got stuck. - You can't move at all? - Oh, I can move. If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the cornrows? I guess so. - Some of these look a little frayed. - Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free. - Hey. - Hi. - So? Did you tell Ross? - Well, I tried... ...but then he had a shampoo-related emergency. - So I guess now it's your turn again. - No, no, no, no. I think it's better if you tell him. You know, it's easier for a woman. That way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go: ""I didn't mean it. I'm so sorry."" Yeah, because that's what we do. All right, all right, okay. How about this? How about this? Tomorrow... Tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together. Okay, that sounds fair. - That just means, once again, we can't... - I know. That's okay. I mean, we can control ourselves. We're not animals. - No! Of course, we can wait. - Yeah. All right, so I guess that means good night then. Yep. Good night. Good night. Good night. - Seriously, good night. - Stop saying good night. I'm so sorry. Look what I found in the drawer. And you said I'd never wear this. Now that I untangled you, how about you do a little something for me? - Sure. What did you have in mind? - I think you know. - Really? I don't... I don't really feel like it. - This is what I want to do. Okay. I just don't get why you like it so much. She's an FBI agent posing as a beauty contestant!

1002,"Okay, Ross. I realize that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but... - Let me explain, okay? - We weren't doing anything! Rach, he just saw us. But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss. - That's a lie! We also kissed in Barbados. - Dude, chill! Okay, we also kissed in Barbados... ...but we didn't plan it. The only reason that that happened... ...was because I saw you kiss Charlie. Yeah, you started it! I have got to chill. Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened. - But... - Oh, we feel so terrible about this, Ross. Yeah. But it did happen. So... Ross? Ross? Can we just close the door? The One Where Ross Is Fine Ross, say something. Anything. So you two are...? - Yeah. - Yeah. And have you had...? - No. No, no, no. - No. No. But if I hadn't walked in here, would you...? Probably... No. No. Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. You have every right to go nuts. I'm not going nuts. Do you see me going nuts? No, but you know what I mean. If you two are happy... ...then I'm happy for you. I'm fine. - Really? - Absolutely. I'm fine. Totally fine. I don't know why it's coming out all loud and squeaky... ...because, really, I'm fine. I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised to see you guys kissing. I mean, at first I was like: But now that I've had time to absorb it... Loving this. - Ross... - It's all working out. Me and Charlie. And you two. - You know what we should do? - Calm ourselves? No. We should all have dinner. Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. I'll cook! Look, don't you think that would be a little weird? Weird? What? What's weird? The only thing weird would be if someone didn't like Mexican food... ...because I'm making fajitas! I do like fajitas. God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption. There's so many ways to go, and this is, like, the biggest decision of our lives. There's a hair in my coffee. Hey, guys. Have you seen Frank Jr.? He's meeting me here with the triplets. It's funny, every time you say ""triplets""... ...I think of three hot, blond 19-year-olds. That's sweet. Drink your hair. Hey, what's all this stuff? They're brochures from different adoption agencies. Babies! Oh, this one is so cute. Get this one. That's not really how it works. - Oh, how does it work? - I don't know! If you're having a hard time, you should talk to my friends... ...Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I'm sure they'd help you. Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be great? All right, all right. Remember what we talked about. When we're in a public place, there are certain rules. That's not what we talked about! - Hi, Frank. - Hi. - Good to see you. - Good to see you too. - Hi, Frank. - Hi. Hey, how you doing? Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big. Which one is which again? Well, that's Frank Jr. Jr... ...pulling the tampons out of the lady's purse. And that's Chandler climbing on Chandler. That's Leslie throwing bagels at him. ""Willing to adopt triplets?"" No. Can I just say, I know we're doing this for Ross and that's cool. But if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date. Well, what would we be doing? I'd take you out for a romantic night. Some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home. Feel me up? In a carriage. - Hey, Charlie! - Hi. - Hi. - Hey. So... ...dreading this? - Oh, you bet. So did you bring a little something for Ross? Actually, it's some stuff you left at my apartment. Well, thanks. And you can just give me my stuff whenever you want. Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out. I thought I heard voices. Hi, Charlie. Hey, Joey. And, oh, you're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend. I'm just kidding. I know Rachel. I know... Come. Please come in. Come in. Okay. Well, we brought you some wine. That is so thoughtful. She's a keeper. - And what did you bring me, huh? - Actually, that's... Underwear, a toothbrush... ...and a Van Halen CD. I can use all these things! Gosh, Ross, you know, you seem a little... What? Fine? Because I am. Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't...? You see? Who else is fine? Come on. Listen. Why don't you try to relax. Maybe have a drink. You know what, that is a very good idea. I'm gonna go make a pitcher of margaritas. Oh, God. So adorable. Look at them, sleeping there like angels. Yeah, I really cherish these moments... ...because before you know it, they're gonna be awake again. Well, they may be a handful... ...but they're so cute. - Yeah. Oh, God, last time I babysat them, they did the funniest thing. I haven't slept in four years. That's a long time. You just don't know how hard it is, Phoebe. There's just so many of them. You know, two I could handle. Two's great. You just hold one in each hand. What do I do when the third one runs at me with his bike helmet on? I got no more hands to protect my area. There's three of them, Phoebe. Three. Yeah, I know, Frank. I counted them when they were coming out of my area. Sometimes, I think that... Oh, no, no, no, I can't say it. It's too horrible. No. What? No, no, I can't. Oh, my God, Frank. Are you thinking of leaving? Because I didn't have those triplets so you could run out on them. Oh, no, I would never do that. No. I just... ...was thinking that, you know, maybe you could take one. What? You can't separate them, that's terrible! Which one? Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us great things about you guys. Please, we're happy to help. We went through the same thing when we were adopting. So a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh? I mean, you have a lovely home. We appreciate anything you can tell us. Well, actually, I think this might help. It's pretty much... ...all the information you need. - Oh, my God. Everything is broken into categories, then cross-referenced. Then color-coded to correspond with the forms in the back. Thank you. I think I just had a tiny orgasm. I know the process is frustrating, but it's so worth it. Adopting Owen was the best thing that ever happened to us. That's great. Can I see the book? You want me to wash my hands first, don't you? Please. It's just so pretty and white. Bathroom is down the hall to your left. I would have told him to do it too. Can I adopt you? - Hey, you must be Owen. - Yeah. I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the Scouts too. - You were? - In fact, my father was a den mother. You know how to use a compass? I have a badge in it. - You do? That's fantastic. - You want to see it? I'd love to, but I gotta get back to your parents. They're telling us about how they adopted you. What? What? I'm adopted? I got nothing. Well, that first batch of margaritas was not so great... ...but this second batch is good. Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some. Oh, God, this is fun, isn't it? You know, just the four of us. Just hanging. Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready? I'm fine, okay? I'm great. I'm just... I'm just proud of us. You know? There's no weirdness, no tension. No awareness. We make a great foursome. We should do more stuff together. Let's take a trip! Okay, where do you think we can go? My fajitas! Look, Charlie, I just want you to know... ...Ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know, he normally doesn't drink like this. You know what, this is nothing. My father is a raging alcoholic. I'm sorry, have I made this evening uncomfortable? Fajitas! Be careful! Very hot plate! Very hot! Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on. That is gonna hurt tomorrow. Okay, well, this is crazy. We can't seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we? Oh, no, of course we're not. - That's insane. - I know. Alice would never go for it. She's pretty tired too. I think we could get her on board. Well, just for argument's sake, you know, hypothetically... ...which one would you be willing to give up? Frank Jr. Jr.? You'd be getting a really good one. I mean, you know, he's really funny. Like, the other day, he made up this joke: What's green and says, ""Hey, I'm a frog""? A talking frog. Oh, no, you can't have him, he's too funny. Well, all right, that's fine. What about Leslie? Oh, no, no, not Leslie. No. She's the only one that knows how to burp the alphabet. All right, so that leaves Chandler. No, no, you can't have Chandler. No, no. She's my little genius. I got big hopes for her. She's gonna be a doctor or a realtor. Wow, Frank, I think we just ran out of kids. Oh, I think you're right. Oh, wow. Phoebe, I don't think I can give one of them up. I mean, you know, they drive me crazy, but they're my babies. I'm sorry, Frank, I didn't realize things were so bad. You know, I'll help out more. I can babysit anytime you want. You name the day and I'll be there. - How about tomorrow? - Well, that's not good. But I can move some stuff around and I'll be there. You and Alice just take the whole day together. You'd do that for us? Are you kidding? That's what sisters are for. Oh, look at them. I love you so much. Oh, crap, don't wake up! Don't wake up! - Where are Bill and Colleen? - Kitchen, getting something to eat. Can you believe how nice they are? We have to leave. Why? What did you do in the bathroom? I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way. He didn't know he was adopted. There's a slight chance... ...I may have told him. Oh, my God, where's my purse? No, I can replace everything in there. - Get that binder and let's go! - Hi. Some little snacks for everybody. You don't have to eat the sour worms. Those are for Owen. I'll go get him in a second. By the way, you should know, we haven't told him he's adopted yet. But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think, on some level, he already knows? - I'm adopted? - See? Intuitive. What? Where did you hear that? He told me. And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell. Which, technically, now you should give back. You told him he's adopted? I'm sorry. You should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. ""Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks Santa is real."" He isn't? We have to get out of here, baby. Everyone, I would like to make a toast... ...to Rachel and Joey. And to love. Ah, love! L-O-V-E. Love. L is for ""life."" And what is life without love? Oh, my God, are we supposed to answer? O is for: ""Oh, wow!"" The V is for this... ...very surprising turn of events... ...which I am still fine with, by the way. E... ...is for how... ...extremely normal I find it... ...that you two... ...are together. And that one day you might get married... ...and have children of your own. - Dude, are you okay? - Totally. Ross, you don't seem okay. I'm sorry, it must be the pressure of entertaining. I think everyone would feel better if we had some flan. Wait, Ross. Ross, l... I have to take off. - No! - I'm sorry. I have an early class in the morning. But this has been lovely. Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey. And that you never really liked Rachel. You are on fire! I'll call you in the morning, okay? - Okay. - All right. God, Rachel, what Ross just said, that's just... That's okay. Girls tend not to like me. Fine. Okay. I guess it's just flan for three. Hey, that rhymes. You know what, Ross, I think we're gonna take off too. Of course. God, I'm so stupid. You guys are a couple now. I mean, you probably just want to be alone. - No, it's just getting late... - It's fine. It's totally fine. I've got plenty of margaritas. It's all good. I don't even know what that's for. You know what? I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay. - That's probably a good idea. - I'll see you in the morning. Okay. Yeah, you know, Joey, l... I don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this. It doesn't look good, does it? Morning. - Here you go. - Thanks. - Did you stay here all night? - Yeah. So you took off my pants and shoes? No. No, no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the <i>Chicago</i> soundtrack. Look, Ross... ...about Rachel and I. Listen, you don't have to worry about that... ...because nothing's gonna happen. What do you mean? She and I said from the beginning... ...we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly... What are you talking about? I'm fine. It's okay, Ross. You know, I totally understand. Of course you're not fine. You're... You're Ross and Rachel. Yeah, except we're not. I mean, we haven't been a couple in, like... ...six years. My God, is that right? Has it been that long? That's what I hear, yeah. This is crazy. I mean, six years... ...and because of me, you guys aren't gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really... ...what is this thing with you and Rachel? Come on, you know me. You know... Joey. I'm crazy about her. And she feels the same way? I think so. Well, then... ...maybe it's time we all moved on. Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it, so... No, but I want to be. I will be. Besides, I'm with Charlie, right? Oh, my God, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I? - She didn't see the dance, did she? - No, no, no. No, that was... That was just for me. Hey, you...? You sure about this? Yeah, I'm sure. And... ...we're okay? - Hey, Pheebs. - Hey. We just want to give you a heads up. Bill and Colleen hate us. Owen didn't know he's adopted and Monica told him. What? Still, he had to find out sometime. How would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them? I'm gonna go tell Emma she was an accident.

1003,"- So you and Rachel tonight, huh? - Yeah. Yeah, it's actually our first official date. Wow, so tonight may be the night. You nervous? No. This is the part I'm actually good at. What must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-Ioathing? It's okay. How can you be so confident? Well, I know exactly what I'm gonna do. - Really? Like, you have a routine? - No. See, each woman is different. You have to appreciate their uniqueness. - Really? - No, I do six things. First, I look deep into her eyes, then I kiss her. Next, I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh. You mean like this? No, not like that. No, no. No, like this: I see what you mean. That's quite nice. - More foosball? - And beer. The One With Ross's Tan - Hey. - Hey. Hey, sweetie. Hey, stop staring at my wife's legs. No, no. Stop staring at your sister's legs. I'm sorry, it's just... How'd you get so tan? She went to one of those spray-on tan places. You got a spray-on tan? Chandler gets pedicures! What? You do? Like, with the toe separators? Why? Why? I can't believe that's sprayed on. I mean, it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one. Sure, then you should get a miniskirt so you can really show it off. So do you get colors or just French tips? - Here. Here's their card. - Thanks. Hey, I know where this place is. It used to be an X-rated video... Florist. - Hey. - Hey, Pheebs. You won't believe who moved back to town. I know. Amanda. - She called me too. She's the worst. - Who's Amanda? She's this girl who lived in the building before you did. Then she moved to England and picked up this fake British accent. On the machine, this is her message: ""Monica, darling, it's Amanda calling."" Are you trying to do a British accent? Chandler gets pedicures. Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect? Know what Amanda said when she called me? ""Oh, so sorry to catch you on your mobile."" If you didn't wanna get me on my mobile, then don't call me on my mobile. And she always brags about all the famous people she's met. Oh, I know! ""I slept with Billy Joel."" All right, who hasn't? What are we gonna do? I don't wanna see her. Let's just cut her out. - What? - Cut her out of our lives. Just ignore her calls and dodge her till she gets the point. Well, I guess we could try that. But it seems so harsh. - Have you ever done that? - No. Had it done to me, though. Feels good. All right, Mr. Geller, right this way. So how dark do you wanna be? We have one, two or three. Well, I like how you look. What are you? - Puerto Rican. - Two. I think a two. You'll face the red light. When the light's on, the spraying's about to start, so close your eyes. When the spraying stops, count to five... ...pat yourself to avoid drip marks, then turn to get your back. Got it? Spray, count, pat and turn. Spray, count and pat. - You catch on quick. - Well, I have a Ph.D., so... One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three... Wait, wait! I'm not... I'm not finished counting! You sprayed my front twice! - You never turned? - No! I barely got to ""three Mississippi""! Mississippi? I said count to five. Mississippi-less-ly? Well, how bad is it? Not that bad yet. But it gets darker for the next four hours. - So how dark will it get? - You got sprayed with two twos and... I'm a four? Yeah, but your back's a zero. You'll wanna even that out. Really? - You might wanna get back in there. - Oh, okay! Wait a minute, there's no light on the back wall. How do I know when it's gonna start? Hello? My eyes! The same thing happened again! - You got two more twos? - I'm an eight! Thanks for dinner. I thought you paid. Guess we won't be going back there. - So... - Yeah. Hey, what do you say we move this onto the likes of the couch? I say cheesy line, but okay. - What's the matter? - I don't know. I'm sorry. - I don't know why I did that. - Okay. Okay. Sorry. I'm sorry. Again, I don't know what happened. I must be nervous. I don't get it. Chandler loved it. I promise. I won't do it again. I really do. This is gonna be great. - Okay. - Okay. Was that good for you? No, don't get it. Let the machine pick up. Yeah, it could be Rachel asking if someone could babysit again. - It could be Amanda. - Oh, you're right. I was just kidding about Rachel. Babysitting's a gas. <i>Hello, Monica.</i> <i>It's Amanda calling again.</i> <i>I'm in the neighborhood,</i> <i>hoping I could pop by your flat.</i> You're from Yonkers! Your last name is Buffamonteezi! <i>Let's see.</i> <i>So should you get this directly...</i> <i>... ring me back on my mobile.</i> Okay, don't hold thy breath. <i>- Hello? Is someone on the line?</i> <i>- Yes. I was looking for Monica.</i> Hang on, she's right here. - Someone's on the phone for you. - We weren't picking up. It's Amanda. I get pedicures. Hi, Amanda. Actually, now is not a good time. Dinner tomorrow night? Okay, Phoebe and I will see you then. Why? Why? Why didn't you just say no? Well, I said no to her coming over now. I couldn't say no twice. I got this uncontrollable need to please people. Fine. Fine. You would not hold up well under torture. - Oh, and you would? - I did. - Rach, are you sure you wanna do this? - Absolutely. It's just a little weird. It's you, and it's me. - It'll just take some getting used to. - Okay. Okay, well, how can we make it easier? Okay. Let's work from the top down. - Just work the bra, Joe. - Okay, got it, yeah. Absolutely. - Okay. - Okay. - Is this thing welded shut? - Okay. All right, turn around. I gotta get a look at this thing. Sorry. Well, this is romantic. I'm sorry. This has never happened to me before. I'm an expert at taking off bras. I could do it with one hand. I could do it with my eyes closed. Once I just looked at one... ...and it popped open. - I blame your bra. - It's a standard-issue bra clasp. Then I blame you. Yeah. That's right. You threw me off with all your slapping. Okay, look, I'm really sorry about that, Joey. But do you think maybe, on some level, you don't want to take off my bra? No, I don't have another level. Hold on. There's something different. I went to that tanning place your wife suggested. Was that place the sun? Oh, and it gets worse. Oh, my God, you can do a duet of ""Ebony and Ivory"" all by yourself. How could you mess this up? It's so easy. You go in the booth, count to five and turn around. - How do you count to five? - One, two, three... Damn it! I know! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic? How was your date with Joey? Well, it was good, until we got back to our apartment. And then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg... ...and I kept slapping it away. You didn't like that? Well, it wasn't just me, all right? He freaked out too. He couldn't even undo my bra. Really? One time he just looked at my bra and it popped open. I do not know what's wrong with us. We've kissed before and that's been great. But this time it was leading somewhere... ...and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me. You guys have been friends forever. The first time you kissed Ross was weird. You couldn't stop laughing. You got through that. Okay. That's true. That's true, we can do this. You're right. We can do this. We'll just power through. Chandler, can I talk to you for a second? No need, problem solved. We are powering through. Chandler, stop. It's not going to pop open. You don't know. - Hi, Phoebe. - Hey. - Is Amanda here yet? - No. I'm sorry for screwing up that ""cutting her out"" plan, but I have a new plan. Chandler will call in a few minutes with an emergency. Okay, what kind of emergency gets us both out of here? What do you think of Mike and Chandler being in a car accident? - Are you kidding? I love it! - Okay. - Hi. - Hi. Hello! It's so nice to see you. Both of you, look at me. Look how young I look! Oh, gosh, we have so much to catch up on. But first things first. Touch my abs. I don't exercise at all. Oh, gosh. So, Monica, you're married. - Yeah, his name is Chandler and he's... - Oh, smell my neck. It's not perfume. It's me. It's my natural scent. Musty. Gosh, this is brilliant. Gosh, it's just like old times. I'm so happy you two are friends again. - When were we not friends? - Well, it was 1992. And I remember, because that was the year I had sex with Evel Knievel. We were friends in 1992. No, I distinctly remember you were dodging her calls... ...and trying to avoid seeing her. - You were going to cut me out? - Well, kind of. - Oh, my God! - Oh, bugger. Should I not have said that? I feel like a perfect arse. Well, in America, you're just an ass. Hello? Chandler, what's wrong? Oh, my God, are you all right? Yeah, I'll be right there. I'm so sorry, but Chandler was in a car accident. - Oh, my God. - Yeah. - Was Mike with him? - Nope. - Got the champagne? - Yes. Ready to power through. Excellent. Put it on ice, the phone is off the hook... ...and, in the interest of powering through... Okay, sexy, sexy... ...very sexy. Sexy. All right, let's do it! Okay, you're scaring me a little bit. Get over it, soldier, we gotta do this. - Okay. You like that, huh? - Oh, yeah. You like that? Let's kick this into high gear, huh? Yeah, baby! I'll show you how we do it! No, no, no! You kneed me in my misters! What? Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. Joey? Are you okay? Soldier down. We are not friends with Phoebe anymore. If she asks, I protested a little, but okay. Chandler, thank God you're alive. Monica, can I talk to you outside? - I have nothing to say to you. - My flat is twice this size. Please, Monica, in the hall? Oh, that accident must have been terrible. You look positively ghastly. Well, aren't you a treat. I can't believe you tried to cut me out. Why, Phoebe? Why? It was right after we were living together... ...and you were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and shrill. Well, I'm still all those things! You're also so generous and kind and scrappy. I am scrappy. Exactly. No matter what I tried to do, I couldn't keep you out of my life. Of all the people I've cut out... ...you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in. That's because I'm scrappy. Yeah, you are, and I'm so glad that you fought your way back in... ...because I don't know what I would do without you. I don't know what I would do without you. Well, I guess we should go back in. I mean, you gave me another chance. - We should do the same for Amanda. - Yeah, I guess you're right. Can you believe it? I've never had any professional dance training. Let me explain how this works. Go in the booth and... I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does it look like this is my first time? Now, I want four two's, and I want them all on my back. Okay. Wait. There's two sets of nozzles! Which one is it? Which one is it? Oh, son of a bitch! What is the matter with us? Well, I know what's the matter with me. No, I mean with us, you know? I mean, is it supposed to be this... ...difficult? I don't know. That fake British woman's a real bitch, but she sure can dance. - Hey. - Hi. Hey, listen, can I ask you a question? When you and Monica first hooked up... ...was it weird going from friends to more than that? Kind of. Sneaking around, having to hide from you guys... No, no, no. No, I mean... ...sexually. Yeah, was there a part of you that felt like it was... ...really wrong? Actually, no. No, it felt right, you know? It felt like, ""I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time."" I can tell from your expressions that's the good news you were hoping for. Well, I'm gonna go continue to spread the joy. Just because it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has to for us. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, just because something's difficult doesn't mean that you quit. - Right, totally. - Yeah. And so... ...we'll just keep trying and trying until we do it. If not, we'll just be a couple that never has sex. That's a plan. - I did not see this coming. - I know. I don't know, I don't get it. I mean, I was so sure this is what I wanted. Me too. Well, how come Monica and Chandler could do it? I guess they weren't as good friends as we are. I bet you're right. So... Yeah. I love you. Love you too. - All right, I'm going to bed. - Yeah, me too. Yeah. I'm not going anywhere for a while. - Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in. - Go away! I don't wanna see anybody! I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. Let me in. Really? Did you count Mississippi-ly? You're not tan. No. I just had to get a picture of this. I'll see you later.

1004,"- Hey, guys. - Hey. Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend. That place in Vermont? You can take a hint. You can't go away this weekend. It's Emma's birthday. We're having a party. Can't you have the party when we get back? No. It won't be her real birthday. Gee, if only she were 1 and had no idea what the hell a birthday was. Come on, you guys, this is really important to us. Sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away... ...you know, to reconnect, emotionally. - There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in <i>Maxim</i>. Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day? Yeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister. And, I mean, you know, you guys, this is a big deal. How can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle? All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party. Fine. But if we end up not doing this <i>Maxim</i> thing because of this party... Believe me, that is not why we won't be doing that. The One With the Cake You know, Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday... ...my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house. And then he would draw a treasure map to help me find them all. I love family traditions like that. When Ursula and I were kids, on our birthday... ...our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food. - Hey, guys. - Hi. - I brought the camera for Emma's video. - Oh, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma... ...and we'll give it to her when she's 18. - Oh, cool. - Wow, it's like a time capsule. - Yeah. Oh, just think, she's gonna be watching that video on a TV... ...that hasn't even been invented yet... ...with friends who, right now, are just, like, babies. And they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built... ...to escape the ant people. That's the hope. - So is Emma awake yet? - No, it's still naptime. - But she'll be up soon. - Where's Joey? I said, it's still naptime. - Hey, there's Uncle Joey. - Hey. Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday. - Eighteen, huh? - Joey, no! What? What? It's for her hot friends. When they see this, you'll be 52. And starting to think about settling down. Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents on? Love to. Yeah. - We were supposed to bring presents? - Yeah. I wrote Emma a song. Oh, yeah. How was I supposed to know? - Joey, it's a birthday party. - Yeah, but for a 1 -year-old. What's the point? The other day she laughed for an hour at a cup. Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it, dressed as a farmer. And he's standing next to this cow, and the cow says, ""El-moo."" Man, that's a funny cup. - Hey. - Hey. - Where's the birthday girl? - Oh, she's still napping. She was probably up all night excited about the party she knows is happening. I know you guys really want to get to Vermont, and this isn't a big deal to you. But it really is to us, okay? Emma will never have a first birthday again. You're right. We're sorry. Let's wake up Emma and get the fun time started! She didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her. Are you frigging kidding me, Greene? - Hi! - Hey! - I'm so glad you came. - I can't believe Emma's already 1. I remember your first birthday. Ross was jealous of all the attention we were giving you. He pulled on his testicles so hard... ...we had to take him to the emergency room. There's something you didn't know about your dad. Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Geller. Let me help you with that. - Thank you. - Oh, man, this is great, huh? The three of us together again. You know what would be fun? If we gave this present to Emma from all of us. Which one are you? - I can't believe Emma's still asleep. - I know. What are we gonna do? I've got a plan. I've got a plan. I'm going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs. You're gonna scream out, and that'll wake her up. I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica. Hey, Pheebs? You know what? I was thinking since you wrote a song... ...maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents. So you're gonna hit on her? No, no, no. My talents as an actor. You know, I could, like, maybe... I could do a dramatic reading of one of her books. Or you could stick a fork in an apple. - Hey, I think Emma might like it. - Oh, Emma might like what? - My present. - What did you get her? - We prepared performances. - Separate performances. But equally real. That sounds like fun. People are getting a little antsy waiting for Emma to wake up from her nap. So would you mind performing them once now? - Sure, yeah! - Okay. Okay. All right. Everybody, let's get this party started. Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us. Oh, great. Aren't you gonna be embarrassed having nothing prepared? I do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole crew waiting. So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us? I will be doing a dramatic reading of one of Emma's books. Oh, okay. Which one? Well, it's one of her favorites. ""<i>Riding the Storm Out:</i> <i>Coping With Postpartum Depression</i>."" <i>Love You Forever</i>. ""<i>Love You Forever</i>, by Robert Munsch. Published by Firefly Books. Printed... ...in Mexico. A mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him... ...back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. And while she held him, she sang, 'I'll love you forever. I'll like you for always. As long as I'm living... ...my baby you'll be.'"" ""And while he rocked her, he sang: 'I'll love you forever. I'll like you for always. As long as I'm living... ...my baby you'll be.'"" Oh, wow! That was amazing. Thank you so much for that gift. I was not ready for this today. - Amazing. Amazing. - Phoebe, I'm sorry. - Phoebe has prepared something as well. - That's right. I prepared a song for Emma, from my heart to hers. For there's no greater gift than the gift of music. <i>Emma! Your name poses a dilemma.</i> <i>'Cause not much else rhymes with Emma! Maybe the actor Richard Crenna...</i> <i>(he played the commanding officer in Rambo)</i> <i>Happy birthday Emma!</i> Is that it? No, of course not. No, I've also, you know, prepared a reading. ""<i>Sex and the Single Mother</i>."" - ""Finding your G-spot."" - Oh, no, no, no! Hello, Emma. Happy 18th birthday. Right now, that seems so far away, 17 years. Yes. You'll be all grown up by then, and we'll be... Well, your grandfather and I might not be here. That's true. This message could be coming to you... ...from beyond the grave, Emma. - After all, my parents died very young. - And my cholesterol's off the charts. Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women too. Okay, cut! Great. Great. That was just... - Yeah. - Oh, good. Ross, don't forget to get a shot of Emma's cake. - It's in a box in the fridge. - Okay, sure. You're gonna love this cake. I got it from a bakery in New Jersey, Carino's. Oh, my God, that place has the creamiest frosting! I used to hitchhike there when I was a kid. Well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes... ...in all different shapes. And if you give them a photo, they'll copy it in icing. - Did you do a picture of Emma? - Yes. On a cake shaped like a bunny. Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake... ...erotic cakes? Say, for bachelorette parties? Ross, what are you talking...? Oh, my God! They put my baby's face on a penis! Now it's a party! Wait, you guys, this isn't funny. If I wanted this cake to be a disaster, I would have baked it myself! Is it okay that I still think it looks delicious? - Jack, look at this. - I know what you're thinking, Judy. The resemblance is uncanny. I am this close to tugging on my testicles again. No, no, this is not what I ordered, okay? I went all the way to New Jersey so that I could have the perfect cake... ...for my daughter's birthday. And I need a bunny cake right now! Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby's face off the penis... ...so we could put it on the bunny. That is a weird sentence. Oh, believe you me, I am going to bring this cake back. I don't even want it in my home. Don't touch it! I'm so confused! Yes, I still want my daughter's picture, but on a bunny cake! Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts! To be fair, this one does have nuts. Mon, it was nice of you to loan Rachel your car... ...so she could get the cake. - It was nice of her to pull my hair... ...till I dropped the key. Well, while we're waiting, you could tape your message to Emma... ...for her 18th birthday, huh? Okay? Hi, Emma. It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap? We're Aunt Monica and Uncle Chandler, by the way. You may not recognize us... ...because we haven't spoken to your parents in 17 years. We used to be married. But then we missed a weekend away together, and things kind of unraveled... ...because of you. Happy birthday. Ross, Rachel promised it would be over by now. We seriously have to go if we want to get to Vermont. - The last train leaves in a half-hour. - And I have a massage client soon. You guys, just, please, a little bit longer. I promise, Rachel will be back with the cake any minute. Monica, remember the frosting, huh? All right, five more minutes. Hello? Oh, no, what happened? Okay, okay, where are you? Okay, I'll be right there. Was that Emma? Is she up? Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot her license. I have to bring it to her. - lf you're leaving, I'm definitely going. - Wait, if anybody gets to go, it's us! We've been complaining the longest! No, wait, you guys. No, you can't leave. Rachel already feels bad that the cake's messed up. How do you think she'll feel when she comes back and you're gone? I don't know. You'll tell us on Monday. Joey, you're in charge, okay? You make sure nobody leaves. Got it! Hey! Where do you think you're going? To the bathroom. Well, the rest of you get comfortable, because we are gonna be here for a... - Wait, there's a window in there. - No! He's not getting away that easy! What are you doing? Get the hell out of here! Well, that one did not have Emma's face on it. - No, it did not. - No. Well, we'd better get going. It's late. Jack can't drive at night anymore. He has trouble staying in his lane. Last winter I went up on a church lawn and drove right through a manger scene. The papers thought it was a hate crime. - Anyway, it was lovely seeing you. - Okay. - Bye. Bye, dear. - Nighty-night. - Nighty-night. - Bye. - How could you just let them leave? - Hey, hey, hey. I'm not gonna mess with Jack. He's a great man. He fought for our country. No, he didn't. He pretended to be a Quaker to get out of Korea. Well, that's it. He's the last one to go. I'm locking you guys in. You do know I can just turn them the other way around, right? Oh, I forgot you used to live here. - Hello? - Joey, it's Estelle. - Hey. <i>- So how'd your audition go today?</i> - What audition? - The one I told you about last week. What? You never said anything about an audition. Let me start over. I just got a call about an audition. <i>I think you can still make it.</i> It's down at the Astor Theater, and you need to have a monologue prepared. A monologue? I don't have a... I got it. So I'm gonna take off. - What? - No, wait! You don't get to leave. I've got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute. And we paid for a room that we're supposed to be in right now! Well, okay, now... ...only one of us has to stay with Emma. Okay, and as the person who realized that, I get to go. No, no, no. No. No. Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying. Oh, I got it. Okay, everyone pick a number from one to 10, all right? Whoever gets the highest number gets to go first. - Okay, 10. - Okay, Monica picks 10. I call nine. Anyone else? - No, let's just draw straws. - Okay. Or we could flip a coin and multiply the answer... - I'm begging you to stop. - Right. Okay, how about this? We got wind-up toys for Emma. We can make them race, and whoever comes in last stays. Yeah, let's do that! That sounds more fun than the thing we were gonna do in Vermont! - Okay, everybody, pick your toys! - Okay. I want the dolphin! - That's a bear! - I'm too excited! Phoebe, you get the bear. Joey, you get the robot. - Oh, yeah. - And Chandler and I get the dog. And the race is going to go from here to here. Now, the one who comes in last stays! Okay, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys. - Okay. On your mark, get set, go! - Go! Go! Come on, robot! What are you barking at? Well, how is that gonna help? I bought you! How did I forget that that's all you do? Way to go, robot! Good job, Alan. - Hey, good race, you guys. - Yeah, see you later. No. No, no. Wait. We didn't lose. The rules clearly stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. Well, our dog never crossed the finish line. So technically... They left. There isn't time to go to the bakery. We're gonna come home. Everybody left? All right. Well, just tell Emma that we'll be there as soon as we can. Bye. - Rachel! - Oh, God, sorry! I can't believe they gave you a ticket. You're such a good driver. - Emma's awake. - Yeah? I can't believe this. This is her first birthday, she's awake, we're not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake. Hey, maybe I can fix that. You know, try to turn it into something else. Oh, don't even bother. We've already ruined her first birthday. And do you know how important these early experiences are, Ross? Very! According to the back cover of that book that you gave me. Rach, she's not gonna remember this. I guess. Oh, I just had such an idea of what this day would be like, you know? Emma laughing... ...and everybody gathered around her cake, singing ""Happy Birthday."" And then we would all... Hey, get out of the road, you stupid student driver! They have to learn. - Hey. - What? This is not bad. Oh, my God. Look, you made it into a bunny. How did you do that? Well, I just made these two things cheeks. And then I split this to make ears. Well, I am very impressed. Some can sing, some can dance. I, apparently, can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures. Now, another way to organize your stuffed animals is by size. I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica? Game? Emma, do you even know it's your birthday today? You're 1. One year old. That's little. That's my girl. That's how old you are. Did I teach her that? Did I just impart wisdom? I want one. Me too. There's no one around. Why don't we just take this one? - And head to Canada. - I was kidding. I wasn't. Let's get going. - Hey, are Ross and Rachel back? - No, not yet. - Oh, good, I didn't miss the party. - What about your massage client? I just felt so bad missing this. So I just slipped him a little something, you know. As long as I'm back in five or six hours, it'll be all right. Okay. If Ross and Rachel ask, I've been here the whole time. The whole time. I've been here the whole time. Joey, we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs. I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks, you guys. Hey, guys, come on. You gotta see what Emma just did. - What? - Emma, how old are you? How old are you today? Emma, that's right. You're that many. Oh, my God, our daughter's a genius. - This means... - No! No science camp! Damn it! I'll put a candle on the cake. Oh, and, Emma, look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly. Thanks. Okay, here we go. Emma's first birthday cake. Go ahead, Emma, blow out the candle. Come on, Emma. You can do it. - What's wrong? Are you okay? - Oh, yeah, nothing. These are happy tears. This is just what I wanted. Hey, you made it into a bunny. What is wrong with me? It looked more delicious when it was a penis. - Okay, you ready? - Yeah. - And record. - Okay. Hi, Emma. Well, your first birthday is over, and... Go! Go! Come on! Go! Go! Come on! Go! Go, Alan! Run, you hairy bastard! Subtitles by SDI Media Group [ENGLISH] <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"
1005,"You know, I'm thinking about letting Emma have her first cookie. Her first cookie? She has cookies all the time. I've never given her a cookie. - Have you? - No. No. And for the record, I've also never given her frosting from a can. Hey, Rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation... ...and we wondered if you would write one for us? - Of course. I would be honored. - Thank you. I think there's been an oversight. We would have asked you. We thought you wouldn't be interested. It's just that we don't think of you as really being so much with the words. Clearly, we were wrong. I got a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, okay? I know how much you want to have a baby... ...and I would love to help you get one. You know what? Then we want you to do it. Thank you. All right. Let me see how I'm gonna start. ""Dear Baby Adoption Decider People..."" So excited about your letter. - Hey. - Hey, Phoebe. - Wow, don't you look nice. - Yes, I do. Today's Mike and my one-year anniversary. What's it the anniversary of? Your first date, your first kiss, first time you had sex? Yeah. So you must be going somewhere fancy to celebrate. A Knicks game. Aren't you a little overdressed? I've never had a one-year anniversary before... ...so no matter where we go, I'm wearing something fancy... ...I'm gonna put on my finest jewelry... ...and we're gonna have sex in a public restroom. You guys do that? Chandler won't even have sex in our bathroom. That's where people make number two. The One Where Rachel's Sister Babysits So, you know, I have a little time if you want to... I'd love to, but I really have to grade these papers. Fine. It's fine. I'll just shower by myself. B. B. B. B. B. You gave a B to a Pottery Barn catalog. Well, it had some good ideas. Take off your shirt. - Damn it. - Rachel, open up! It's your sister! I have to talk to you. Hi, Amy. - You're not Rachel. - Still sharp as a tack. Charlie, this is Rachel's sister Amy. Amy, this is Charlie. - Hi. Nice to meet you. - Hi, hi. And you are? Ross? I grew up on your block? We had Thanksgiving together last year? I had a baby with your sister? No. I... Did I buy a falafel from you yesterday? Yes. Yes, you did. Hi, Rachel. Here's your sister Amy. She thinks I need pec implants. Amy? Hi. - You remember Joey. - Yeah. Hey, sure. - The <i>Days of our Lives</i> guy. - That's right, yeah. You are not good. Always nice to meet a fan. - So, now, what are you doing here? - Well, I have huge news. - Hold on. Let me check on the baby. - This is important. Can't Ella wait? Her name is Emma. Why did you change it? Ella was so much prettier. What do I know? I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart. Hey, your English is getting better. - Oh, my God. - I know. She may be the hottest girl I've ever hated. - What you working on? - Monica and Chandler's recommendation. I want it to sound smart, but I don't know any big words or anything. - Why don't you use your thesaurus? - What did I just say? Watch. Here, highlight the word you want to change, go under ""tools""... ...and the thesaurus generates... Gives. Gives a whole list of choices. You can pick the word that sounds smartest. My God, that's great. I'm smart. No, no, I'm: ""Brainy, bright, clever."" I love this thing! Look out, ladies! Joey Tribbiani's got the whole package! God... ...so beautiful. I know, isn't she? No, I was talking about your bedding. All right, what's your news, Amy? Well... ...I'm getting married. Wow! Oh, my God! - To who? - This guy. He has a killer apartment. - And...? - And it's on Fifth. And the elevator opens up right into the living room. - No, what's he like? - Oh, he's okay. Do you remember my old boyfriend Mark? - Yeah. - It's his dad. - Wow, so he's gotta be... - Old? Yeah. But he travels a lot, so he's hardly ever there. Sweetie, I gotta tell you, it sounds a little bit like... ...you like the apartment more than you like... Myron. Yeah, I told you he was old. Sit down. Sit down. Honey, you know... ...I once also almost married somebody that I didn't love. - Do you remember Barry? - Remember him? God, we used to make out all the time after you went to sleep. Sometimes just nodding is okay. But anyway, listen. Not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever, ever made. Honey, Amy, you deserve true love. Your soul mate is out there somewhere. Someone that is your age, that is smart, that is fun... ...and that you care about. You're right. - You're right. I'm gonna do it. - Okay. I'm gonna marry Myron and keep looking for Mr. Right. Okay, let's keep talking. Excuse me. Anniversary. Excuse me. Anniversary. Sir, could you move your nachos? They're in my seat. It's my anniversary. Here we are. - I can't believe it's been a whole year. - I know. This has been the best year... - This has been the best year of my life! - Me too! I never thought I could love someone this much! I feel the same way! You're so generous and kind, and you're amazing in bed! It's our anniversary. <i>Knicks fans, please turn your attention</i> <i>to the big screen on the scoreboard.</i> <i>Someone has a special question to ask.</i> How lame. It's so tacky and impersonal. - Really? - It's the worst way to propose. Excuse me. I finished my recommendation. Here. And I think you'll be very, very happy. It's the longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn. I don't understand. Some of the words a little too sophisticated for you? It doesn't make any sense. Well, of course it does. It's smart. I used a thesaurus. On every word? Yep. All right, what was this sentence originally? ""They are warm, nice people with big hearts."" And that became, ""They are humid, prepossessing <i>Homo sapiens...</i> ...with full-sized aortic pumps."" Yeah. Yeah. And hey, I really mean it, dude. All right, Joey, I don't think we can use this. - Why not? - Well, because you signed it: ""Baby Kangaroo Tribbiani."" Why don't you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself. You don't need a thesaurus. Just write from here. Your full-sized aortic pump. - Amy. Hi. - I took your advice. - I left Myron. - Good for you! I know. I'm Erin Brockovich. Yes, you are. - I'm so proud of you. - Thank you. So can I stay with you? But Erin Brockovich had her own house. Look who's back. Why do you have bags? Why does she have bags? I'm staying with you guys. - What? - We're gonna be roomies! Come on. - You slept out here? - Yeah. Amy kept kicking me in her sleep, yelling, ""Myron, get off!"" But we're getting rid of her, right? Please tell me we're getting rid of her? - Joey, I can't do that. - Oh, come on. Last night I was finishing off a pizza, and she said: ""A moment on the lips, forever on the hips."" I don't need that kind of talk in my house! Joey, look, I know that she's difficult... ...but I think it's really good that she's here. Because we'll appreciate it more when she's gone? No, it's just... Look, when I first moved to this city, I was a lot like her. I was spoiled, self-centered. And you guys really took care of me. Yeah. Monica made us. Well, whatever. I really appreciate it... ...because I don't think I would be the person I am today... ...if it wasn't for you guys. So I want to help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know it's gonna take patience, but that's okay. - Good morning. - Yeah. That's what I'm wearing today. That's why I hung it on the door. Oh, sweetie, you can't pull this off. You know what? I was thinking that maybe now would be a good time... ...for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future. Oh, I can't, honey. I'm gonna go get my eyebrows shaped. I am not happy. Sure you want to eat that? I'm curvy and I like it! - Hi. - Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever. I doubt that. Tell her about us last year. Well, I bought Chandler a $500 watch, and he wrote me a rap song. - Seriously? - Word. Mine was worse than that. - Well, what happened? - We were at the game. This guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing. - That is so tacky. - Well, that's what I said. But it turns out Mike was planning to propose to me that same way last night. Oh, my God. Mike was gonna propose? - That's huge. - Do you want to marry him? Yeah, I really do. Yes. But after I dumped on the way he was gonna do it... ...I don't think he'll ever ask again. I said no in Barbados, and now this? She's right. If I were a guy and... Did I just say, ""If I were a guy""? You don't need him to propose to you. Maybe you could propose to him. Oh, I don't know. I don't know. Isn't that a little desperate? I proposed to Chandler. All right, moving on. I don't think it was desperate. It was amazing. Thank you. - Well, do you think I should propose? - I think it could be kind of great. Absolutely. You'll love the feeling. There's nothing like it. Okay. Okay. So how should I do it? How about at a game on the big screen? How about at a Foot Locker? What? What, he obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to. - Plus, he'd never suspect it. - Yeah, that does make sense. - Okay, now, would you two like that? - Sounds good to me. But what would a guy think? - Nana's on the phone. - Wow. That's interesting, since she died seven years ago. She did? Who got her condo in Boca? Hello? It's our nanny. Hi. Oh, God, I hope you feel better. Okay. Bye. That's Molly. She's sick. - Can you watch Emma today? - I can't. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had? Because my throat's been hurting. Menstrual cramps. I don't think that's what this is. - Can any of you watch Emma? - No, I'm sorry, sweetie. No, I've got work, and then I'm proposing. Great. Shoot. What am I gonna do? Well, I could do it. - Well, actually... - Can I talk to you for a second? I do not want her babysitting our child. - Why not? - For one thing, she keeps calling her Ella. - Ella's a nice name. - Fine, we'll call the next one Ella. - The next one? - Okay. I don't want her watching our baby. Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge breakthrough for her. She just offered to do something for another human being. You know, I don't know. Ross, I'm telling you... ...she's giving up getting her eyebrows shaped to do this, all right? Do you understand how important that is in our world? Listen, I couldn't help but overhear, because I was trying to. Listen, let me do this. I really want to help you guys out. And plus, Rachel's been so wonderful to me. - Absolutely. - Oh, great! So how much does it pay? How's the second draft of the letter coming? Great. I'm finished. In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency. - You dropped it off? - Yeah. Can we read it? Can you print out another copy? No can do, <i>amigo.</i> No, I didn't use the computer. It felt more personal to handwrite it. - You handwrote it? - Yeah, and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at all. See you later. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. That letter is gonna go in our file. We're never gonna get a kid. We're gonna be one of those old couples... ...that collects orchids or has a lot of birds. It's okay. You know what? I will just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter. Okay, good. Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Someone just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter and... Okay. Thank you. Goodbye. We're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way to the bird store. - They loved it. - What? They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the letter. They thought Joey was a child? She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings. - Hi. - Hey, what'd you guys do today? Ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi. - That sounds like fun. - Yeah, not really. Babies are dull. - Hey. Hi, how's my girl? - I'm fine. And I got you a present for letting me stay with you. - Ready? - Yeah. You pierced her ears? Doesn't it make her nose look smaller? You pierced her ears? How could you do this without telling me? If I had told you, then it wouldn't have been a surprise, now would it? I think she looks cute. But I am wrong. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out. Why, did something happen to his falafel cart? - Hey, guys. - Ross! Hi, Emma. Why is she wearing her hat so low? - She can barely see. - I don't really want her to see. Why not? Because there are so many terrible sights in this world. Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton, but it looked like meat? Come here. Come here. There she is. Hi. - What? - Nothing. Hi. What...? - Please tell me those are clip-ons! - Oh, they're real. Did she do this to her? I told you we shouldn't have left Emma with her! I know, I know. And you were right, Ross. Okay? You are so irresponsible! I am never letting you babysit again! You know what? This kid needs me, okay? - She needs to have a cool, fun aunt. - I'm a cool, fun aunt. Okay. Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure out what to do with your life. This is how you repay me? I don't need you to help me. I already know what I'm gonna do with my life. - Oh, yeah? Since when? - Since today. I am going to be a baby stylist. - What? - That's not a thing! Well, it should be. I'm gonna help babies learn how to accessorize... ...what colors to wear, what clothes are slimming. - Babies don't care if they're slim! - Enter Amy. - Amy, l... I just... I just wanna... - What? What are you gonna do? No more falafel for you! Great game, huh? - Why do you keep looking at the screen? - I'm not. I'm praying. Please let the Knicks win. Thank you, Thor. - Where are you going? - I'm going to the bathroom. - Well, I think you should wait. - Why? Well, if you don't hold it in, you don't get all the nutrients. <i>Knicks fans, please turn your attention</i> <i>to the big screen on the scoreboard.</i> <i>Someone has a special question to ask.</i> Mike Hannigan, will you marry me? <i>Get a load of this.</i> <i>She's proposing to him!</i> <i>Guess we know who wears</i> <i>the pants in that family.</i> Well, that's not very enlightened. Boo us? Boo you! Hello? Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani. Oh, hi. Well, I'm glad you liked my letter. No, my mommy and daddy aren't home right now. Okay, bye-bye. She was nice. Joey, get Amy's bags. She is moving out. - You're kicking me out? - You put holes in my baby's ears. At least now people will know she's a girl! I can't believe I ever even tried to help you. - You are so beyond help! - You know what? Ever since I got here, you have been nothing but negative. - Excuse me? - You didn't want me... ...to marry the old guy with the great apartment. Then I tried to help your daughter de-emphasize her flaws... ...and suddenly I'm the bad guy? - Joey, where are those bags? - She has a lot of crap! You know? When I moved in here, I thought, ""This will be so great. Just us sisters back together again like when we were kids."" Except without that stupid Jill. Who has gotten fat, by the way. Seriously? Mom said she gained, like, 15 pounds. - Hips or thighs? - Ass and face. Oh, my God! I thought she was on Atkins. She was. Carbs found her. See? This is what I wanted. Two sisters talking about real stuff. Oh, I can give you that. - You can? - Yeah. I kept trying to make you a better person, but you're... You're already a pretty perfect version of what you are. Thank you. You gotta admit, Emma does look cute. - Did you just say, ""Emma""? - Oh, I'm sorry. Ella. That woman didn't know what she was talking about, Mike. Obviously, you have balls. - Please, let's forget the whole thing. - I would love it. - Consider it forgotten. - Thank you. But just so you know... However and whenever you decide to propose, I promise I'll say yes. Whether, you know, it's at a basketball game... ...or in skywriting... ...or, you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie... ...who hides it in the cake. It's in the cake, isn't it? Where else would lame Mr. No Balls hide it? What's the matter with me? Why do I keep ruining this? - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - No, it's my fault. I keep trying to propose in these stupid ways... ...and I just wanna tell you I love you, and I wanna spend my life with you... - I'm gonna do this now. - Oh, my God. - Phoebe, l... - Wait. Oh, wait. Ready? Okay. Phoebe, I love you. There's no one else in the world I would ask to marry me three times. But I want to take care of you... ...have babies with you... ...and grow old with you. Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me? Yes. - I love you. - I love you more. Not possible. She's gonna be Mrs. No Balls! So how's the baby-styling business going? Not that great. It's almost as if people don't want to hear that their babies are ugly. That's shocking. There's Ross. Hey, Ross. Hello, Ross? He's rude.

1006,"- Hey. - Hi. Pheebs, what's wrong? I'm just so exhausted from dragging around this huge engagement ring. - Oh, my God. - Congratulations. So did he get on one knee? Did he have a speech prepared? Oh, did he cry? Yeah, big surprise, I like proposals. Well, it was really sweet, and, like, the most romantic thing ever. Here's to Phoebe, who's found the greatest guy in the world. To Phoebe and... I want to say ""Mike""? - To Phoebe and Mike. - Hey. Thank you. Oh, and I have something for you. It's my little black book. It's got the numbers of all the guys I've dated. Oh, Phoebe, that's nice, but you know what? I think I'm okay. Give it to one of your other single girlfriends. I would, but you're the last one. Give me the book! ""Pablo Diaz. Brady Smith. Guy in Van""? Oh, my first love. What is the red X next to Bob Gremore's name mean? Dead. Oh, it's okay. No, he was old. Yeah. And he lived a full life. He was in the first wave at Omaha Beach. I should've given you guys my black book when I got married. Although, it wasn't so much a book as a napkin. With Janice's phone number on it. Phoebe, isn't Jethro Tull a band? Oh, yes, they are. The One With Ross' Grant Hey, honey. Hey, sweetie. - Is Monica not here? - No. Then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding for a big account, and they got it. - It's my first national commercial. - Cool. And I don't want to brag, but a lot of the ideas were mine. Hell, you weren't there. All the ideas were mine. That's great. Hey, can you cast me in it? I really don't think you're right for the part. What do you mean? I can do anything. I'm a chameleon. I'm old. I'm tired. Oh, I am hot. I'm cold. Come on, what can't I do? First of all, bravo. But I don't think you're right for this. The part's a stuffy college professor. I can do that. Hello, I'm your professor. When I'm not busy thinking of important things, or professing... ...I like to use... What's the product? Software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions. I'm cold. - Hey. - Hey. Guess who's a finalist for a huge research grant? I'll give you a hint. He's looking right at you. Well, unless it's the creepy guy with his hand up his kilt... ...I'm gonna say, ""Congratulations."" I'm so excited. Apparently, I beat out hundreds of other applicants... ...including five guys I went to graduate school with. Not that I'm keeping score, or anything. Five. - Wow, that's great. - Yeah. - So tell me about the grant. - Well, okay, it's for $25,000. And if I get it, I'll be able to complete my field research. And there will be an article about me in the <i>Paleontology Review</i>. It'll be the first time my name is in there... ...without people raising serious questions about my work. - Are you talking about the Dewer Grant? - Yeah. Why? Benjamin Hobart is administering that grant. - Your ex-boyfriend? - Yeah. So your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant? Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed. No. No, we ended on great terms. If anything, I think this could help you. You know what? Why don't we all go out to dinner, and I can introduce you. - lf you think it'd help. - Yeah, absolutely. I'll call him. Now, is there anything I could do to butter him up? Anything he really likes? He does have a pretty serious latex fetish. We'll see how dinner goes. - Hey. - Hey, you want to go see a movie? I told you I had to spend all day clearing out stuff so Mike could move in. - Oh, right. - Yeah. Now that I'm here, I might as well help with the cleaning and organizing. I just happen to have my label maker. Oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff. Did you and Chandler make compromises when you moved in together? Chandler did. - What does he want you to give up? - A bunch of stuff. And the worst one, he wants me to get rid of Gladys. Who's Gladys? Oh, what a tragic loss. Yeah, I really hate to give her up. Oh, I know. Oh, you should take her. Oh, I don't know. - What, you don't like her? - Of course I do. What's not to like? I'd take her in a minute. But I think that you're giving up too easy. I think that you need to fight for her. - Really, you think? - Absolutely. You say to him, ""I'm sorry, Mike, I can't live without her. She means too much to me."" Okay, I'll fight for her. Okay. Oh, wait. I just realized, if I do that, that means you don't get her. Damn it, I did not think this through. - Hey, guys. - Hi. Oh, any word on casting yet? - I told you, you're not right for the part. - What do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor you'd buy some kind of e-crap from? I'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never gonna be interested in. Look, come on, please? It's not like I'm asking you for some crazy favor. This is what I do for a living. I am a professional actor. Man, I'm two hours late for work. Here's my reel. It's got all the commercials that I've been in. - Joe... - Just watch it. If you don't like it, don't pass it on to your bosses. - Fine. - Thank you. - Work, Joe. - Damn it. - What am I gonna do now? - Just pass the tape along. He's not right for the part. If I suggest him, my bosses will think I'm an idiot. And that's something they should learn on their own. Just tell Joey that you watched the tape... ...and you liked it, but your bosses didn't. Then you're the good guy, and they're the bad guy. That's good. I liked it, they didn't. Joey, for God's sake, go to work. I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart. I've always thought of him as someone I'd invite... ...to my fantasy dinner party. Do you think there's any chance he'll bring Christie Brinkley or C-3PO? Sorry, it looks like it's just him. Charlie. My God, you look absolutely stunning. Well, I am having a good hair day. - It's so good to see you. - Oh, you too. I'm okay. I'm sorry. Ross Geller, Benjamin Hobart. It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell you how long... ...I've been an admirer of your work. I mean, that Nobel Prize. I mean, I have to tell you that you're one of the reasons I got into the field. Well, likewise. Not likewise. I'd never heard of you until this morning. But it's nice to be nice. - Shall we? - Yeah. Thank you. I can't believe that you chose this restaurant. - Do you remember the night? - Oh, my God. I completely forgot. Oh, my God, I can't believe they let us back in this place. You weren't there. No, but, you know, it's just a funny image. You know, the two of you in this restaurant with the... Why don't you tell Benji about your proposal while I go to the ladies' room. So tell me about it. Okay. Well, I would like to do a dig in the Painted Desert. There are still several areas that haven't been fully excavated. - Break up with Charlie. - What? What? Did you just say, ""Break up with Charlie""? Well, yes and no. Yes, I did say it. And no, I didn't not say it. - Kind of inappropriate, don't you think? - Listen, I'm sorry. I just haven't seen her for so long, all these feelings are rushing back. I'm starting to realize how much I've missed her. And I'm gonna need you to break up with her. - Are you serious? - lf you say, yes, then I'm serious. If you say, no, then I'm joking. - No. - Joking it is. - Hi, sorry I'm late. - Hey, how'd it go with Mike? - Is he gonna let you keep the painting? - No, he really hates it. But he's gonna let me keep my box of human hair. So you gotta pick your battles. But the good news is, Gladys is yours. Wow, what's the bad news? - Who's Gladys? - Oh, she's that work of art I made. You know, with the woman coming out of the frame. And Monica gets to keep her? In her house? I am so jealous. I didn't know you wanted her too. Well, I mean, sure, of course. But you already gave that to Monica, so... - You know, I would give her up for you. - No, I couldn't let you do that. - No, but I want to. - But I don't want you to. - But I insist. - But I insist harder. Girls. Girls. Stop. Okay, we'll flip a coin. Heads, she's Rachel's. Tails, she's Monica's. - Tails. Monica, she's yours. - No, that landed in your food. No, no, that's okay. You won fair and square. I'm so sad. - Hey, Joe? - What's up? Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses... ...and they weren't interested. I'm sorry, man. - But you watched the tape? - Yeah, I liked it. But my bosses didn't go for it. Stupid sons of bitches. - You didn't watch the tape. - What? Of course I did. Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me? - I'm not lying to you. I watched it. - You lied again. - I watched it. - Keep going, Pinocchio. - I did. - No, you didn't. I'm telling you, I watched the tape. - Did you watch the tape? - No. The selection committee has chosen the three of you as our finalists. The decision will be based on the answers you give to the questions I ask. We'll start with Dr. Li. You claim the field is too reliant... ...on the Linnaean taxonomic system. How do you propose to correct this? I believe that the answers lie in the osteological evidence. - I plan to begin there. - Interesting. I guess. Dr. Biely, your proposal includes some fieldwork. Where might that take place? Primarily in the Pierre Shale region of South Dakota. Certainly. Very well. And Dr. Geller, when is my birthday? What? l... Care to venture a guess? - May 12? - That's not even kind of close. Dr. Li, how many graduate students will you need? - Half a dozen. - I see. And Dr. Biely? Three for excavation, and two for analysis. Certainly. Dr. Geller, which 1965 Shirelles hit... ...was later covered by a popular British Invasion band? What? I need six graduate students. No, I'm sorry. We were looking for ""Baby It's You."" ""Baby It's You."" What? Wait just a minute. None of my questions have anything to do with paleontology. You're right, I apologize. Scratch the last question. Spell ""Boscodictiasaur."" I've never heard of a ""Boscodictiasaur."" Yeah, I just made it up. Spell it. - Okay. B-O... - No, it starts with a silent M. Oh, come on! I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar. But you are a liar. What did I just say? - Are you still here? - Yes. And I'm not just hurt, I'm insulted. When I tell somebody I did something... Okay, hold on, let me just stop you right there, okay? First, you lied. Right? Then you lied about lying, okay? Then you lied about lying about lying, okay? So before you lie about lying about lying about lying about lying... Stop lying. Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape? You wanna know why? You wanna know why? Well, this is going well. Here's how I know. If you had seen what was on this tape, believe me, you'd have some comments. All right, remember, I got paid a lot of money for this... ...and it only aired in Japan. <i>Ichiban.</i> <i>Ichiban, lipstick for men.</i> <i>Ichiban, lipstick for men.</i> And that's how I know you didn't watch the tape. He really is a chameleon. Well, Gladys, say hello to your new home. - Oh, my. - Wow. Oh, she is so nice and big. Oh, Monica, where are you going to display Gladys, oh, so proudly? - I haven't really settled on a spot yet. - How about right above the TV? That way, it will be the first thing that you see when you walk in the door. Yeah, yeah, and you can get rid of that French poster. - I like that poster. - Really? It doesn't have anything coming out of it. Or maybe there's someplace for her in your bedroom? - There's nothing above your bed. - Are you still here? Oh, hi. Hello. Have you come to ask me some more paleontology-related questions? Your grandmother's nickname, perhaps? Ann-Margaret's pant size? I've come here to apologize. I think I may have let my feelings... ...for Charlie interfere with the interview process. No. Stop! Anyway, I decided to offer you the grant. - Really? - There is just one small stipulation. - I have to break up with Charlie? - Hey, you got one right. - You're crazy. - Crazy or romantic? Crazy. - Or? - Get out! Oh, my God. - What? - Joey, what is this thing doing here? I got her from Monica. She sold it to me for a very reasonable price. - Joey, we're not keeping this. - But it's an original Buffay. All right, fine. You can keep it. As long as you don't mind that she's haunted. Hey, what? What? Well, legend has it, Joey, that she comes alive when you're asleep. She climbs out of the frame... ...and then drags her half-a-body across the floor... ...just looking for legs to steal. And then with her one good hand... ...she slowly reaches up... ...and turns your doorknob. Get that legless witch out of here! - Hey, I sold that to Joey. - Yeah, well, I told him it's haunted. - Two can play at this game. - Too late. You can't give it back. - Oh, yes, I can. - No, you can't, she's yours. - She's yours. - She's yours. - She's yours. - Hey. - She's mine. - She's mine. - She's mine. - She's mine. You guys, you don't have to fight over her anymore. Whoever doesn't get Gladys, gets Glynnis. - I want Gladys. - She's mine. - She's mine. - She's mine. Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And I promise next time to submit you, whether I think you're right or not. That's not the point, Chandler. The point is that you lied. I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you to forgive me? Oh, my God. Excellent. Now what do you say? Lying is wrong. And? And?! I'm a pretty little girl. I knew it. Your ex-boyfriend is insane. - Did you get the grant? - No. And you wanna know why? Because your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you. What? He refused me because I wouldn't give you up. Benji isn't in love with me. I mean, he broke up with me. - And besides, he's a very ethical man. - Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review: ""Who was the voice of Underdog?"" I'm sure he was just joking. If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him. I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question. - Seriously? - Oh, I'm sorry. No, he did ask me one: ""How do you spell Boscodictiasaur?"" Well, if it's like the Lake Mbosco in Congo, then M-B-O... Damn it. Dr. Geller. Charlie, what are you doing here? I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox. That's the voice of Underdog. Like I tried to tell you in the interview... ...this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia. No, don't do that. I want you to look her in the eyes and tell her the truth. Benji? It's true. I behaved horribly, but it's only because I still love you. And I would do anything to have you back in my life. Too little, too late, Benji. - I can't believe this. - I never should've broken up with you. I think about you all the time. Do you ever still think about me? No. - Yes. - What? I don't know what to say, Benji. This is all so... ...romantic. Or? I know I may be way out of bounds here... ...but is there any chance you would take me back? Maybe. Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable. Oh, God. I am so sorry, but... I mean, there's so much history between us, you know? I'm sorry too. - I love you. - I love you too. Okay, that's it, we are seeing other people. Gladys? For the third time this week. Man, this does not get old. - You're mean! - Oh, don't be such a baby. Please. Subtitles by SDI Media Group [ENGLISH] <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"
1007,"Hey, you guys. Hey, what are you doing? - Figuring out our wedding plans. - Funny. We were doing the same thing. It's really crazy. The hall, the dress, the food. - I had no idea how expensive this was. - Yeah, it is really pricey. - I freaked when I heard the numbers. - So, what did you two do about it? It was simple. I came up with some cost-cutting solutions... ...wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell. There's no way around it. Just accept that this is gonna cost a lot of money. I heard that weddings are, like, a $40 billion-a-year industry. Yeah. And I'm responsible for just, like, half of that. But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use. Are you serious? Yeah. How would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity... ...and we just got married at City Hall? I think it would make me wanna marry you even more. I gotta say, you guys, that's an incredible gesture. Maybe you do that next time you get married. No, no, no. The next time's gonna be Hawaii at sunset. But maybe the time after that. The One With the Home Study - Hey. What's going on? - Hey. Our adoption social worker is coming, so we're cleaning the apartment. ""We""? You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways. Is this the person who decides whether or not you get a baby? - She's coming to see where we live. - And it has to go perfectly. If she doesn't like us, she can keep us off every adoption list in the state. Hey, maybe I should stop by. She could be a soap opera fan. It's very impressive when the little people know a celebrity. ""Little people""? ""Celebrity."" So I think I'm just about done here. Unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere, like porn or cigarettes? What? - No. - Chandler. I don't, and I'm offended by the insinuation. So there's not a magazine under the couch... ...or cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank... ...or a filthy video in the VCR? I'll admit the cigarettes and magazine. But that tape is not mine. - It isn't mine. - I guess we'll never know whose it is. May I help you? We're here to make a rather sizable donation to the children. Any contribution, large or small, is appreciated. I think you're gonna appreciate the crap out of this one. - Well, this is very generous. - And we don't want any recognition. This is completely anonymous. Completely anonymous. From two kind strangers. Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay. We can put your names in our newsletter. - Not necessary. - Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y. And X is spelled ""Mike Hannigan."" Well, on behalf of the children, thank you both very much. - I'm glad we did this. It feels so good. - It does. It feels really good. Oh, look. And we get these free T-shirts. Actually, that's the shirt I wore to the gym. It's moist. - Hi. Emma will be up in a minute. - Oh, good. Hey, Ross, listen. I heard about you and Charlie. I'm really sorry. That's okay. I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there. - Absolutely. - There was one. She's it. All the rest look like they should live under a bridge. So, what are you gonna do today? I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground. Oh, my God. What? Like I said, I was thinking of taking Emma to the Museum of Knives and Fire. Okay, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground. Because...? All right, if you must know, I had a traumatic... ...swing incident when I was little. - Seriously? - Yes. I was 4 years old. And I was on the swing... ...and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain. And to get me out, my mom had to cut a big chunk of my hair. And it was uneven for weeks. And you made it through that? I wonder who's gonna play you in the movie. Okay, fine, you can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there. And I was thinking Claire Danes. Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy. But the swings are perfectly safe. And besides, Emma loves them. - You should come, and you'll see. - Those things go, like, 40 miles an hour. And there's that moment when you're at the top... ...when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to Earth. Space is filled with orbiting children. Look, please, just come on. When you see the look on Emma's face, I swear, you won't regret it. - All right. - Good. You don't wanna be a mom who passes her irrational fears to her children. ""Irrational,"" huh? I'll remember that next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment. That's the same. I'm sure there are 30 different species of poisonous swings. Oh, my God. The adoption lady is early. Okay. Okay. Here we go. Here we go. Stand up straight. Big smile. Hello. Is this the Creepy residence? We're waiting for the adoption lady. But I'm glad you're here. I was cleaning this morning and I found this. I don't know if you wanna use it, but... Oh, this is so sweet of you. But I won't be needing a veil. I actually won't be wearing a dress at all. I told you, I am not coming to a naked wedding! No. We're not having a big reception. We took the wedding money and donated it to a children's charity. That's crazy! I'm sorry. I can't imagine giving up my one wedding day like that. Well, we're different. I don't care about having a huge party. This is really nice for you, but... Oh, please. I put this on and I just look like... Well, radiant. All right, but who cares? I don't need a pretty veil and a fancy dress. That's right. You're making a commitment. You know, that's the same whether you do it at the Plaza or... - Where you gonna do it? - City Hall. Oh, that sounds nice. I was just there for jury duty. They've really spruced that place up. Okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. I've made my decision. What I really want is a great big wedding. - But you gave all the money to charity. - Well, I'll just ask for it back. - I don't think you can do that. - Why not? This is her wedding day. That's way more important than some stupid kids. That's sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption lady. - All right, okay. Be careful. - Okay. Careful. Watch her hair. Watch her hair! - Rach, she's got, like, three hairs. - I know. I know. But they're just so beautiful. Oh, my God, I just pulled one out. I promise you she's safe. Watch how much she loves this. - Okay. Okay. - Are you ready, sweetie? Here we go. Okay, careful. Okay. She's smiling. Look at that, she does like it. See, I told you. Oh, my God. Look at her, she's a little daredevil. - Oh, God. Let me push. Can I push? - Oh, absolutely. Oh, God. Okay, get the camera. It's in the diaper bag. Okay. See? Scared of the swings. I bet you feel pretty silly. - We're asking for the money back? - It's for our wedding day. Now, is this guy gay or straight? Because one of us has to start flirting. You here to make another donation the same day? I don't think that's ever happened before. Gay. Go. Oh, my God, I love your shirt. The donation we made earlier? Well, we want it back. Excuse me? Okay, that money was for a big wedding we thought we didn't want. But it turns out we do. So you're asking us to refund your donation to the children? Yeah. This feels really good. I'm sorry. I am. But this wedding's just really important to me. Hey, it's none of my business. Besides, this is probably a good thing. We've really been spoiling the children, what with all the food and warm clothing. That's not fair. A person's wedding is important. And especially to me. I didn't have a graduation party. And I didn't go to prom. And I spent my sweet 16 being chased around a tire yard... ...by an escaped mental patient who, in his own words, wanted to: ""Kill me, or whatever."" So I deserve a real celebration. And I'm not gonna let some sweaty little man make me feel badly about it. She could've been talking about either one of us. Hi, I'm Laura. I'm here for your adoption interview. Hi, I'm Monica. And this is Chandler. - Please come in. - Thank you. - Would you like something to drink? - Water would be fine. We're so glad that you're here. We're excited about getting this process started. Because we love kids. Love them to death. Well, not actually to death. That's just a figure of speech. We love kids the appropriate amount... ...as allowed by law. - Your place is just lovely. - Thank you. Yes, this building does have a wholesome, family feel to it. I feel like I've been here before. Any other couples in the building adopting? Is that that couple on the first floor? We should get a baby before them. That guy tried to sell me drugs. But other than that, wholesome, wholesome building. - What? - I realized why I remember this place. - Really? What is it? - Oh, it's nothing. I went on a date with a guy who lived in this building. It didn't end very well. That wouldn't, by any chance, be Joey Tribbiani? - Yes! - Of course it was. We had a great night. In the morning, he promised he'd call and he didn't. Rat bastard! - So you're not friends with him? - Oh, God, no. - No, no, no. - No. Nope. Well, I'm sorry I brought it up. So are either one of you planning on staying at home? Hello? Anybody in there order a celebrity? What was that? That's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's great with kids, though. - Ross. Oh, my God, are you okay? - Son of a bitch! Oh, relax. I didn't say the F-word. Ross, see, I told you! Those swings are evil! That's the last time Emma is getting on one of those things for her entire life. No, no, no. Okay, it wasn't the swing's fault. It was my fault. And kind of that kid's fault. Who is still laughing. Nice. Come on. Can we just get out of here before somebody else gets hurt? No. Wait. I have an idea. I want you to get on the swing... ...and you'll see that there's nothing to be afraid of. I know what this is all about. You've always been jealous of my hair. I just think you're an adult, okay? And you should get over your silly fears. - All right, fine. I'll do it. - Good. - lf you hold a spider. - Where?! Where?! If you hold a spider. I know. Guys, is everything okay? It's me, Joey. Adoption! What's going on? Oh, it's just like I said, that crazy... ...Bert, roaming the halls. - Guys? - Keep on roaming, Bert! We don't want any crazy today! - What's going on? - We'll talk later! Everything's fine! Everything doesn't sound fine. Is he all right out there by himself? Oh, yeah. He has a caretaker. His older brother... ...Ernie. - Bert and Ernie? - You can't make this stuff up. You never told me about that guy and your sweet 16. - I'm sorry about that. - Oh, it ended okay. One of my friends shot him. At least you'll get a proper wedding. You really deserve that. Yeah, I really do. You know, I had nothing growing up. Just like the kids I took the money from. No. No, no. I see where this is going. Don't make me go back there. Look, I can't have a wedding with this money now. It's tainted. Fine, we'll give the money back. If that guy at the charity gives us a hard time... ...my friend hasn't shot anyone in a really long time. I must say this seems like a lovely environment to raise a child in. You are welcome to look under any of the furniture... ...because, believe me, you won't find any porn or cigarettes under there. Before we look around, let me make sure I have everything I need up to here. Why don't I show you the baby's room. - What are you doing? - You wouldn't let me in. - I thought you were in trouble. - Well, we're not. But you called me ""Bert."" That's our code word for danger. - We don't have a code word. - We don't? We really should. From now on, ""Bert"" will be our code word for danger. So that was the baby's room. - What room should we see next? - Any room that isn't behind this couch. Some people don't get him, but I think he's really funny. I did not care for that. You have to leave. You slept with our social worker and never called her back. She is still pissed, so she can't see you. Okay, okay. - What? - I forgot my bat. Oh, my God. And for the last time, we do not want to be friends with you! And we don't wanna buy your bat! What are you doing here? Bert. Bert. Bert. Bert. - Are you friends with him? - I can explain. Joey? All right. Okay. You have got some nerve coming back here. - I can't believe you never called me. - Excuse me? You probably don't even remember my name. It's Joey, by the way. And don't bother telling me yours, because I totally remember it, lady. I waited weeks for you to call me. I gave you my number. You never called me. Don't try to turn this around on me. I am not some kind of social work... ...that you can just... ...do. - I'm pretty sure I gave you my number. - Really? Think about it. Come on. You're a beautiful woman. Smart, funny. We had a really good time. If I had your number, why wouldn't I call you? I don't know. Well, maybe I'm wrong. I'm sorry. Hey, too late for apologies. Okay? You broke my heart. You know how many women I had to sleep with to get over you? - Joey, wait... - No! I waited a long time! I can't wait anymore. I'm sorry that you had to see that. I'm so embarrassed. - Oh, that's really okay. - Yeah. We totally understand. - Dating is hard. - Boy, you people are nice. And I've got to say... ...I think you're going to make excellent parents. Laura! We're back. Are you here to take more money? Because I think what you're looking for is an ATM. No, no, we're here to give the money back. Yeah. Because you know what? It's all about the children. Although it's also about the wedding. All right, here. No. Oh, God. If I haven't said so already, sir, congratulations. Okay, look, enough, all right? I'm stepping in and putting my foot down. As your future husband, I'm gonna make this decision for us. What do you think we should do? - It's not your decision anymore. - What? On behalf of the children of New York, I reject your money. - But we're giving you this. - And I'm giving it back to you. Come on. Consider it a contribution. Well, this is very generous. Take the check. Have a great wedding and a wonderful life together. Sounds good to me. We can save up, come back in a few years... ...and make an even bigger donation. And when you do, ask for Brian. - Oh, is that you? - No. Hello? Oh, hi. Oh, my God, really? I can't wait to tell Chandler. Okay. Goodbye. - Wrong number? - That was Laura. She gave us a great report and we're officially on the waiting list. - That's great. - Now we just wait for a call... ...and someone tells us there's a baby waiting for us. Hello? Have you seen Joey's bat? Okay. I got a spider. There were two, I picked the bigger one. - Okay. - Okay. This feels perfectly normal. Okay, get on the swing. Okay. Okay. Okay. - See? - All right. I can do this. There you go. Good for you. You know what? I'm getting used to this little guy. - I don't even feel him in here anymore. - That's because he's on your neck.

1008,"- Hey, guys. - Hey. - Hi. - Hey. We need to talk about something. Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year. - What? - Are you kidding? Well, it's just with work and the stress of adoption... ...we don't feel like we have the energy. Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us. That doesn't sound like you. That's Monica talking. - No, we made this decision together. - She's putting words in your mouth. Don't you put words in people's mouths. You put turkey in people's mouths. I can't believe this. This is Emma's first Thanksgiving. - No, it's not. - It's not? When was she born? Well, personally, I think it's great you're giving yourself a break. - Thank you, Pheebs. - Sure. It's just as well. I mean, last year wasn't very good. I think she's losing her touch. - What? You are way off, lady. - Am I? Really? Am I? Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong. Well, think about it. You'd be trying to top what you did last year. You'd be in competition with yourself. That's my favorite kind. Okay, we are doing this. Don't let yourself get manipulated this way. Stay out of this, Chandler. This is between me and me. We are supposed to make these decisions together. Did you not watch the <i>Dr. Phil</i> I taped for you? The One With The Late Thanksgiving - Hey. - Hi. Happy Thanksgiving. Happy Meatless Turkey-Murder Day. You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on Bleeker. - Could you pick them up for me? - You're not making the pies? I don't make chocolate pies. When I was younger, I entered this pie-eating contest. I ate so many that the thought of them makes me sick. Did you at least win the contest? Two minutes, twelve pies and a part of one tin. - Okay, I'll see you guys at 4. - Can't wait. This dinner is gonna be so great. In your face, last-year me. - Hey, Rach? - Yeah. What's Emma doing today? Well, let's see, I know that she has a meeting with her lawyer... ...and then she has to make a very big poop. - Why? - I want to enter her in a baby pageant. Oh, my God. That's the creepiest thing I've ever heard. Okay, but before you say no, my friend Suzanne is entering her kid. And compared to Emma, she's a real dog. - Phoebe, all babies are beautiful. - Oh, okay. No. Phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another... ...I mean, you know, and judging who's cuter just for a trophy... - And a thousand dollars. ...is something I'm very interested in. Oh, please, do not tell Ross. He still believes that what's on the inside is important. Okay. And Emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition. Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving? Well, I was thinking... Take the clothes off Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid! Did someone drop the baton again? Why come all the way from Kansas to do that? I don't get older, I just get better. You know what just occurred to me? This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us. I mean, we could be getting a baby soon. - You don't know that. - Somebody's gonna pick us. But we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency. I'm telling you, it's gonna happen. Next year, it's gonna be you, me and little Hemingway Bing. - What? He's my favorite author. - Name one of his books. <i>The Firm</i>? Okay, let's see. Okay, the turkey's in the oven. The stuffing is ready. You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year. Oh, Chandler, that's sweet. But you don't have to do everything Dr. Phil tells you to do. I'm serious, let me do something. Just not the turkey. Nothing high-profile. Okay, let's see. Oh, the cranberry sauce. It's easy to make, and no one really cares about it. Tell me more. I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these. Not with soap! You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes. - Hi. Hey, guess what Joey has. - Three tickets to today's Rangers game! Dude, I wanted him to guess. - Oh, my God. - Yeah, they're great seats too. - Guess where they are. - Center ice. Did I do something to you? - The game's at 1. - So? - Dinner's at 4. We'll never make it back. - So we'll leave before it's over. But it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus, Joey could get lost and they could have to page us to go pick him up. Dude, two times that happened! Look, Monica's been working hard all day. She didn't want to host in the first place. We shouldn't go. He's right, man. - Yeah, I guess. So we'll see you at 4. - Okay. And get ready to taste my very special cranberries. Or should I say ""Chan-berries""? That's some gentle comedy, dude. - We're still going to the game, right? - Yeah. <i>This is contestant number 16,</i> <i>Rebecca Hope from Yonkers.</i> - Hey. - Phoebe, listen, I think we gotta go. This place is freaking me out. I've been watching this guy over there. I don't think he came with a kid. But we can't leave now. There was this one baby, Haley, who was favored to win... ...she got croup, so she had to stay home. This competition just blew wide-open, folks. Phoebe, it's just too weird. I just saw a 1 -year-old with pantyhose on. Oh, I know. We should've been more prepared. It's okay. Now, the way I see it, our real competition now is Cameron. My God, they just took her sweater off. Look at those arms. Hello, Michelin Man. Phoebe, come on. You know what, it's already 3:00. They haven't even gotten to Emma's group yet. We got dinner. But Emma's got what it takes. She could go all the way! - Phoebe, you have to calm down. - Okay. Rachel, the hottest babies in the tri-state area are in this room right now. I overheard a judge say that not one of them holds a candle to Emma. - Really? - Yeah. - You heard him say that? - Yeah. All right. Okay. All right, let's give these babies something to cry about. Good. Let's get down to business. Emma needs some makeup. What? She's gonna look washed-out next to the others. No, I'm not letting you put makeup on my baby. - Why not? - Because I already did. You suck! Get off the ice, you idiot! - What a game. - I know. Yeah. - I can't believe Chandler's missing this. - I'm sorry he's not here. But I gotta say, I am really enjoying nacho chair. Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't keep batting my hand away. - Yeah! - These seats are great. I know, I know. When I was here for ""Holidays on Ice""... ...I was sitting so far away, Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner. We'd better get going. If we don't leave now, we're gonna be late. But it's a tie game. So we're a little late. The girls will be there. Let's just stay for one more goal. - I don't know. - One more fight. - Okay. - Okay. Where is everybody? They're 45 minutes late. I can't believe they're not here. I slave and I slave for what? They've ruined Cranberry Day. - How late are we? - Forty-five minutes. - Here. - Okay. Rachel and Phoebe are already there, so they probably started without us. We could just slip in, and no one needs to know where we were. - You may want to lose the foam finger. - Oh, no, no, no. You just want to put it on your hand. - You're not at Thanksgiving? - No, we're late. - What are you doing here? - We're late too. We figured we could be late because you'd be on time. Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani. - Nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us. - Yeah, where were you? - Well... - Yeah, what's with the trophy? Well, we were at a spelling bee. And I won. You won an adult Thanksgiving Day spelling bee? Yes. Y-E-S. Yes. Let me see this. ""Grand Supreme Little Darling, New York Division""? That's me. You entered Emma in a beauty pageant? And it looks like she put makeup on her. Wait a second. Where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before? I can't believe this. She's our daughter. That you would treat her like some kind of show dog is inexcusable. - She won a thousand dollars. - So this is an annual thing? That's Alicia May Emory's outfit! Guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier. - What are we gonna do? - I gotta put Emma down for a nap. And, Rach, while you're in there, throw something on Alicia May. - All right, what are we gonna say? - We'll say that we were mugged. You can't get mad at someone who's been mugged. Good. But you don't look like you were mugged. No. Here. Hey! Do you hear something? - They're out there. - Let me see. I can't believe this. They're an hour late, and they're just standing there talking. Everything's so distorted. It looks like Joey has a giant hand. That says ""Rangers"" on it. They went to the game. Oh, they are in for a world of pain. - Ross' shirt is torn. - They're late and they're sloppy. All right, Emma's napping. What happened to your shirt? I got mugged, and they stole my pocket. We're just trying to figure out an excuse. How about this? We could say that Monica told us 5:00, not 4:00. That way we're right on time. Or we could plant PCP in the apartment and call the cops on her. That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around. We'll just say that she said it was 5:00. We'll just act casual. We're not late, we're right on time. ""We know you're out there."" Who do you think it's from? Oh, God, this is bad. This is so bad. Well, let's just go in there and face them. I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy. I hate that thing. It's like a bolt of lightning. Why don't we play rock, paper, scissors, and whoever loses, goes in first. - All right, I'm in. - Ready. I win. - What is that? - That's fire. It beats everything. Oh, really? Does it beat water balloon? Well-played, Phoebe Buffay. Well-played. All right, let's all go in at the same time. - Okay. - Okay. - It's locked. - What? Oh, sure, now they lock it. When they're having sex on the couch, it's like: ""Come on in, my butt is surprisingly hairy!"" All right, come on. All right, you guys, we're so sorry we're late. Please let us in so we can have dinner together. No, everything's cold. The turkey's dried out and the stuffing's all soggy. Yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that's... What happens to cranberry sauce? - Nothing, it's fine. - Oh, thank God. Come on, you guys, we're sorry. Our subway broke down. That's a lie! You went to the game. I can see Joey's hand. For the love of God, take it off! Guys, it doesn't matter why we're late. We're all here now. Please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey. I had a dream once about a fax machine that did that. That's all the turkey you're gonna get. - How are we gonna decide who gets this? - Water balloon! What are we gonna do? I'm starving. I just remembered, we do have something to eat. Monica put something in our oven this morning. You touch that, and you will be sorry! Guys, I'd listen to her. The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it! Oh, my God, it's Brussels sprouts! That's worse than no food. All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts. Stinky? Please let me stay on this side of the door. Oh, I know! I still have my old key. We can just unlock the door. I don't know if that's a good idea. They don't wanna be with us. I don't wanna be with them either... ...but it's Thanksgiving, and we should not want to be together together. If I could just get in there, make a face-to-face apology... ...Iook them in the eye, I could get them to forgive us. - I don't know. - I'm telling you... ...I can do it. Yeah, he can do it. It all looks so beautiful. - The turkey, the stuffing. - The cranberries. Enough! A monkey could've made them. Hey, listen, guys, we feel really terrible. He's doing that weird eye-contact thing. Don't look at him. Don't look at him. Come on, you guys. We want you to know we're very, very sorry. Right, guys? - I feel terrible. - Oh, so sorry. But let's not ruin this day. You've worked so hard. Let's move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh? The floating heads do make a good point. Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad. - So bad. - So bad. Okay. Okay, you two go get the dessert, and I'll let you in. Dessert? Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up the pies. You did remember, right? Pies. Oh, we thought you said ""prize."" Here. - ""Grand Supreme Little Darling""? - Congratulations! Oh, my God, you forgot the pies? Well, I cannot believe this. You forced me to make dinner, you're an hour late... ...and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do. Really, girls, not cool. Well, you man-heads aren't any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it'd make you late, and you went anyway. Hey, I'm getting a little tired of this. We said we're sorry. It's Thanksgiving, for Pete's sakes! A day of forgiveness. - It's a day to be thankful. - Don't make me come up there! It's too late for apologies. Fine, let's just go. I don't need your stupid dinner. That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling. - Oh, is that what that is? - Sorry. Come on, you guys, let's just do our own Thanksgiving. - Yeah, I'll cook. - Yeah, let's go out. Yeah, you three have a nice Thanksgiving. - The three of us? - Yeah. You, Chan and the vein. - I'm stuck. - Joey, that is not gonna work. No, seriously. - I'm really wedged in here. - I'll pull you through. Okay. Stop, stop, I'm worried about damaging my head. It's a little late for that. Hurry up, you gotta do something. All right, well, this does not change anything. We need to get something to grease his face. - We got turkey grease. - Bring it. I just want to say that I'm sorry I referred to the vein as a separate person. Here you go. Oh, that smells good. - Okay? - Okay, try it. It isn't working. - We're gonna have to unscrew the chain. - Hurry, I can't feel my ears. Can you ever feel your ears? Interesting. - Chandler, where are your tools? - Oh, I left them on my bulldozer. I don't have tools. - Well, I do, but Rachel borrowed them. - I lent them to Ross. - I gave them to Joey. - I left them at the park. I'm finding it really hard not to mess with him. I stuffed Brussels sprouts down his pants. Nice. Okay, I have to get that. Now, when I get back, I want you and your friends to be gone. Thanksgiving is over. The vein has spoken. - It's really starting to hurt. - Look, I'm gonna pull on the door... ...and you guys push. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? Okay, so push. Just a sec. We're kind of in the middle of something here. Hey, stop putting things down my pants. - Come on, guys, push! - Yeah, come on, push! Push! Push! - My cranberries! - Man, I got food all over me. I can't believe what you did. Monica's gonna kill you. Look! Look! Look what the... Look what the floating heads did! I don't care. What's going on? That was the adoption agency. And? - We're getting a baby! - Are you serious?! There's a pregnant woman in Ohio, and she picked us. - Oh, my God, that's great! - That's incredible. I'm so happy for you. This Thanksgiving kicks last Thanksgiving's ass! To Monica and Chandler and that knocked-up girl in Ohio. I'm just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid. - I know. - Have you considered pageanting? I can't believe they called. I mean, we're actually getting a baby. I know how you feel. - Really? - Sure. I went through the exact same thing with Alicia May Emory. The waiting, the wondering. Then one day, I get that call from Toys""R""Us. She was in stock. That is the exact same thing. Subtitles by SDI Media Group [ENGLISH] <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"
1009,"- Hey. - Hey. We're here to say goodbye. We're off to Ohio. Oh, right, your adoption interview. Yep. We'll meet the lady who could be carrying our baby. I can't believe it. When you come back, you'll have a baby. That is so weird. And so incorrect. She's only a few months pregnant. She liked our application but might not like us. Come on, she's gonna love you guys. Thank you. But we're trying not to get our hopes up. A lot could still get in our way. She could decide against adoption, like another couple better. What are you gonna name it? I could develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word. But just think, okay? What if everything goes right? What if this woman does pick you guys? Oh, my God. She's gonna pick us! So we're standing firm on ""not getting our hopes up""? No. I know things could still go wrong, but if they don't... ...if this works out, we're gonna have a baby. A baby! - Yes. But... - Oh, my God. It's gonna work! We're gonna make it work! I'm gonna be a mommy, and you're gonna be a daddy! All right, I'll see you suckers. I'm gonna go get me a baby! Screw it. I'm gonna be a daddy! The One With the Birth Mother Hey, who's Phoebe with? I wanna say, ""Someone I'm gonna have sex with."" - Hey. - Hey. - So who's your friend? - Oh, that's Sarah. No. Don't you get any ideas. I'm not setting you up with any more of my friends. - Why? Why? - Because you'll date her once... ...sleep with her, then forget she exists. Name one friend of yours I did that with. - Mandy. - Mandy, huh? Really hot blond, big boobs? - No. - Might be why I don't remember, huh? Do you think I'm someone else? Look, I may not have treated your friends well in the past. But I have grown up a lot. Really. Honest. Rach? Yeah, believe it or not, it's true. I mean, when Joey and I were together... ...he was wonderful. He was thoughtful and mature. And for the one week that we went out... ...he didn't sleep with anybody else. Growth. - Fine, I'll give you her number. - Okay. Thank you. And I promise you I will not forget this one. - Mandy. - Sarah! Sarah. - Hey. - Hi. - Hey. - Hey, guys, I need some fashion advice. How does this look? Well, it's... It's a little low. Pick it up a little. A little bit more. A little bit more. There you go. Now throw it away. Come on! This looks good. Ross, please trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now I don't know who's running for president or who that NATO guy is... ...but I do know that you have to get far away from that hat. Damn it. God... I have this date tomorrow night, and I have to look cool. If you want fashion help, Rachel and I are going shopping tomorrow. - You're welcome to come with us. - Really? That would be great. I mean, I have to do something. She kind of teased me about how I dress. I can see why. Nice shirt. You're wearing the same shirt. Stupid Gap on every corner! Make yourselves comfortable, and I'll be back with Erica. Okay, thank you. Well, this is it. - Are you okay? - Yeah, it's just weird, you know? It's like, ""Hi, I'm Chandler. May I have the human growing inside you?"" You're gonna be great. You're gonna be great. Well, obviously. Monica? Chandler? I'd like you to meet Erica. - Hi. - Hi. It is so, so nice to meet you. - Hi. - Thank you for agreeing to see us. - Hi. - I'll let you get acquainted. - Okay. - So it's Monica and Chandler? I only know you as ""File CRW33815-D."" That's what our friends call us. Gosh, you know, you're just such an amazing couple. It's... ...kind of intimidating. I don't know about that. Are you kidding me? I mean, it's enough that you're a doctor. But on top of it, you're married to a reverend? - I don't think that's exactly... - Let her finish, doctor. - Hey. - Hey. My friend Sarah had a great time last night. - Yeah. - Yeah, so you gonna call this one back? No. What are you talking about? Sarah's great. Oh, really? You want to know what your ""great"" friend did? We're out to dinner, okay? We were getting along, having a really nice time. I was thinking she was really cool. And then, out of nowhere... That's it? That's why you won't go out with her again? So she took some fries. Big deal. Hey, look, it's not about a few fries. It's about what the fries represent. - What? - All food! Well, I'm sorry. I can't believe I set you up with such a monster! Hey, look, I take a girl out... ...she can order whatever she wants. The more the better, all right? Just don't order a garden salad and then eat my food! That's a good way to lose some fingers. - Thank God you're here. Listen to this. - What? Joey and my friend are out last night, having dinner, and she reaches over... ...and takes a few of his fries... - Oh, no! What? You know about the plate thing? Oh, yeah, yeah. No, Joey doesn't share food. I mean, just last week we were having breakfast... ...and he had a couple grapes on his plate. - You wouldn't let her have a grape? - No, not me. Emma. Joey doesn't share food! Well, I still think that is a stupid reason not to call someone again. You are calling her, okay? And if you need to, then just get an extra plate of fries for the table. I like that. A sharing buffer. Yeah. Yeah, I'll order some extra fries. Maybe a plate of onion rings. Yeah. Yeah. And a shrimp cocktail. And some Buffalo wings. Maybe... Maybe an individual pizza, huh? And some mozzarella sticks. What were we talking about? Wow, this place is awesome. We should just go. I'm not gonna find anything here. This stuff is ridiculous. Oh, this place is great! Rach, come on, I'm not gonna wear any of this. Nothing silver. - Why? - Okay, nothing with hair. And nothing with padlocks on it! Ross, look. Look, I know that some of this stuff is out there. But I mean, come on, look at this. Look at this sweater. I mean, this is just beautiful. Wow, this is really soft. Three hundred and fifty dollars? Down from 700. You're saving, like, 200 bucks. Both logic and math are taking a serious hit today. Hey, check this out. It's totally you. - Wow. - Yeah. Wow. Actually, this looks pretty good. Yeah. ""Boys will be boys""? - What? They will be! - All right. - That's it, I'm getting out of here. - No, Ross, wait, come on. There's other stuff here. There's some nice shirts, these nice pants. Actually, these might look pretty good on me. Yes, they will. You know what you should do? Go take a walk. All right? I know your size, and I'll pick out some really good stuff for you. - Really? - Yes. I know what looks sexy on guys. Just wear what I suggest, and she is gonna go nuts for you. So you're saying... ...if I wear these pants, I might be getting into hers? Why do men keep talking to me like this? So the fact that I'm a doctor and my wife's a reverend... ...that's important to you? Yeah. I read some great applications... ...but I thought, ""Who better than a minister to raise a child?"" Amen. Plus, I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor. Good hands. Healing hands. Reverend, can I ask? Does the Bible say anything about adoption? It says, ""Do it."" ""And behold, she did adopt unto them a baby. And it was good."" - Wow. - Yeah, wow. I was wondering... You both have such serious jobs. Would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock? Oh, no, my flock? My flock is good. Yeah. My flock pretty much takes care of themselves by this point. Good flock. Flock, flock, flock. But being a doctor, that must take up a lot of time. Not for me it doesn't. So how's everything going in here? We're great. I think I may have asked all my questions. Good. Do you have questions for Erica? Yeah, actually. So you read a file that you liked... ...and then you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us? Yes. Our system ensures total anonymity. - We're very proud of it. - You should be. You're really on top of stuff. Well then, if there's nothing else, then the two of us should talk. I actually... - I don't think we have to. - We don't? Yeah, when I read about you two, I was pretty sure I wanted you... ...but I just thought we should meet face to face. I've made my decision. I choose them. God, this is great. This is so great. Did you hear that? Yeah, I did. Hey. Thank you. Thank you so much. You are so going to heaven! - We got some really great stuff. - Yeah. Yeah, but I'm not sure about some of the bras I got. Really? Do you want to try some of them on for me? Okay. Wait, are we in Joey's imagination? Oh, no. I took one of Ross' bags by mistake. And one of mine is missing. Ross probably has it. You'll get it from him later. So, what do you think? I think we're not wearing the same shirt anymore. Yeah. Yeah, Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her, and you know what? I'm glad I did. I turned quite a few heads on my way over here. Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that. I see. Somebody's afraid of a little competition with the ladies? Looks like someone is the ladies! You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. Yeah. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a date. See? All eyes on me! - We are not signing those papers. - Why not? It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else. God works in mysterious ways. You have got to stop. But she liked us. She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica. If you think about it, I'm kind of like a reverend. I mean, as a chef, I serve God by feeding the hungry and poor. Your veal chop is 34.95! Come on, I just... I think we've been given an opportunity. The mistake's already made. They're writing up the papers now. But we're not the ones she chose. How can you feel okay about this? Because. We may not be who she thinks we are... ...but no one will ever love that baby more than us. - I know. - I mean, who knows... ...how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if no one ever picks us? Oh, honey... Please? Please. We are so close. Monica, I want a baby too. But this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to. Okay. You're right. So we'll tell the truth. And who knows, you know? Maybe she'll like us for us. Maybe she will. Why couldn't I have been a reverend? You're Jewish. Technicality! Garden salad for the lady. Oh, that looks great. Good ordering. Seafood platter for the gentleman, and extra fries. Enjoy. Those fries look delicious. I didn't know you liked French fries. Help yourself. What's mine is yours. Wow, are those stuffed clams? Yes, they are my stuffed clams. How about those fries, though, huh? - They are delicious. - Yeah. You are beautiful, you know that? That is so sweet. Okay, then. Now look what you did! What? What is the matter with you? I don't like it when people take food off of my plate, okay? But you said, ""What's mine is yours."" Well, I didn't mean it! Fine. Sorry, I didn't think it was that big a deal. No, I'm sorry. I... I'm overreacting, okay? It's just, when it comes to food, I... ...have certain rules... ...okay? I mean... ...there are things you do, and, you know, things that you don't do. Wow, this place looks great. Oh, you are gonna love it. And I'm so glad we're finally doing this. - Me too. - Here. So this was fun. I really am sorry about, you know, before. And I want to make sure you know I really do like you. Sure, just not as much as clams. Well, stuffed clams... Chocolate torte for the lady. Cheesecake for the gentleman. Excuse me, sir. There seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake. Yes, that's a raspberry coulis. I'm so stupid ordering cheesecake, trying to be healthy. Oh, my God. - I'll just have what she's having. - I'm sorry, sir. That was our last piece. Oh, no. This is work. I should call in. Can you excuse me? Yeah, sure. No problem. What are you doing? I thought you don't share food? Sure I do. Coulis? No. If I can't have your clams, you can't have my dessert. This is a two-way street. Really? Really. Now this all better be here when I come back. Yeah, of course. I can control myself. Stop staring at me! Just a tiny little... I'm not even sorry. - Hi. - Hey. So these are the preliminary forms for an open adoption. There's a lot to go over, but I'll explain as we go through. - Is that a picture? - Yeah. It's a sonogram they took of the baby last week. I thought you might want to see it. Look, doctor. Look, before we sign anything, we really have to talk. We're not who you think we are. - I don't understand. - The agency must have made a mistake. My wife is not a reverend, and I'm not a doctor. - What? - That's impossible. I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like. I have to check your file. Excuse me. So who are you? Our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York. Yeah, but the important thing to know about us... ...is how much we would care for this little baby. So you lied to me before? Well, we ""bore false witness."" See? I could be a reverend. I can't believe this. But we were hoping that since we told you the truth... ...that you still might consider... - Giving you my baby? You think I'd give you my child after this? You don't have to decide now. If you look at our file... I don't want to look at your file. This is over. Erica, wait. I have nothing to say to you. Look, you have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. And we don't know how long it's gonna be before we get another chance. Why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it? Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef, and I'm in advertising. Oh, yeah. I actually liked you guys. But it doesn't matter. What you did was wrong. But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She is loving, and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this, but the woman's always right. I love my wife more than anything in this world. And it... It kills me that I can't give her a baby. I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... ...she's already there. She's a mother... ...without a baby. Please? You still want that baby? God bless you, Chandler Bing! Turns out this sweater is made for a woman. So why are you still wearing it? Because it's soft. Hey, so how was your date? Not so good. Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh, buddy? Yeah. And you know what? We could do a lot worse. - Yeah. - Yeah. Joey doesn't share food!

101,"The One Where It All Began (Pilot) There's nothing to tell. It's just some guy I work with. You're going out with the guy. There has to be something wrong with him. All right, Joey. Be nice. So does he have a hump and a hairpiece? Wait, does he eat chalk? I don't want her to go through what I did with Carl. Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and not having sex. Sounds like a date to me. I'm in high school, in the cafeteria.. and I realize I'm totally naked. I've had that dream. Then I look down and I realize there is a phone.. there. - Instead of - That's right! Never had that one. All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. What do I do? Everyone starts looking at me. They weren't looking at you before? Finally, I figure I'd better answer it. And it turns out it's my mother. Which is very, very weird because she never calls me. Hi. He says, ""Hello,"" I want to kill myself. You okay? I feel like someone pulled my intestine out of my mouth.. - and tied it around my neck. - Cookie? Carol moved her stuff out today. - Let me get you some coffee. - Thanks. No, don't! Stop cleansing my aura. - Just leave my aura alone, okay? - Fine, be murky. - I'll be fine. I hope she'll be happy. - No, you don't. No, I don't. To hell with her. She left me! You never knew she was a lesbian? No! Okay? Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know. How should I know? Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian. Did I say that out loud? I told Mom and Dad last night. They took it pretty well. Oh, really? So that hysterical phone call from a woman sobbing.. ""I'll never have grandchildren,"" was what? A wrong number? Sorry. Look, you're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is? Strip joints! Hey, you're single. Have some hormones. But I don't want to be single, okay? I just want to be married again. And I just want a million dollars! - Rachel? - Oh, Monica! Thank God! I went to your building.. and a guy with a hammer said you'd be here, and you are. - Can I get you some coffee? - Decaf. Everybody, this is Rachel, a Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody. Chandler and Phoebe.. Joey. Remember my brother, Ross? Sure! You want to tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids? Well, it started about a half-hour before the wedding. I was in the room with all the presents.. and I was looking at this really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat. When all of a sudden Sweet 'N Low? I realized I was more turned on by this gravy boat than Barry. I got freaked out, and it hit me: How much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. I always knew he looked familiar, but.. I had to get out of there, and I started wondering.. ""Why am I doing this,"" and ""Who am I doing it for?"" I didn't know where to go, and I know we've drifted apart.. but you're the only person I know here. - Who wasn't invited to the wedding. - I hoped that wouldn't be an issue. I guess he bought her the pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it. ""Tuna or egg salad! Decide!"" ""I'll have whatever Christina's having."" Daddy, I just I can't marry him. I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me! ""If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off."" She should not be wearing those pants. Push her down the stairs! Push her! Push her down the stairs! Come on, Daddy, listen! All my life, everyone's always told me, ""You're a shoe!"" ""You're a shoe!"" What if I don't want to be a shoe? What if I want to be a purse? Or a hat? No, I don't want you to buy me a hat! It's a metaphor, Daddy! You can see where he'd have trouble. Look, Daddy, it's my life. Well, maybe I'll just stay here with Monica. I guess we've established she's staying with Monica. Well, maybe that's my decision. Maybe I don't need your money. Wait! I said maybe! Just breathe. That's it. Try to think of nice, calm things. Raindrops on roses And whiskers on kittens Doorbells and sleigh bells And something with mittens La la la something And noodles with string I'm all better now. I helped. This is probably for the best. Independence. Controlling your life. The whole hat thing. You can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. He's away a lot. Stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day. Like there's a rule, or something? I got it. Please don't do that again. It's a horrible sound. It's Paul. Oh, God, is it 6:30? Buzz him in. - Who's Paul? - Paul, the wine guy? Maybe. Your ""not a real date"" is with Paul, the wine guy? - He finally asked you out? - Yes! It's a ""Dear Diary"" moment. - Rach, I can cancel. - Please, go, I'll be fine. Ross, are you okay? Do you want me to stay? That'd be good. - Really?- Go on! It's Paul, the wine guy! Does he sell it, drink it? Or he just complains a lot? Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. everybody. Everybody, this is Paul. - The wine guy. - I didn't catch your name. Paul? I'll be right back. I've just gotta go A-wandering? Change. Sit down. Two seconds. I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good. Hey, Paul, here's a tip. She really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot.. until it starts to get red. Shut up, Joey! What are you up to tonight? I was supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon.. so, nothing. Right. You're not even getting your honeymoon. Although, Aruba. This time of year? Talk about your.. big lizards. If you don't want to be alone tonight.. Joey and Chandler are helping me with my furniture. We're very excited about it. Thanks. But I'm just going to hang out here. - It's been a long day. - Oh, sure. Phoebe, wanna help? I wish I could, but I don't want to. Love is sweet as summer showers Love is a wondrous work of art But your love Oh, your love, your love Is like a giant pigeon Crapping on my heart Thank you. I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y thing to the side things.. using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no bracket-y thing. I see no worm guys whatsoever.. and I cannot feel my legs. - We got a bookcase. - It's beautiful. What's this? I would have to say that is an L-shaped bracket. - Which goes where? - I have no idea. - Done with the bookcase. - All finished. This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can. I should have known. - Start with that, we're out of here. - Please don't spoil all this fun. Let me ask you. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV. What did you get? - You guys. - You got screwed. - Oh, my God. - I know. I'm such an idiot. I should've known when she went to the dentist five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get? My brother's going through that. How did you get over it? He might accidentally break something valuable of hers. - Say her - Leg? That's one way of doing it. I went for the watch. You actually broke her watch? The worst I ever did was shred my old boyfriend's favorite towel. - Steer clear of you. - That's right. Barry, I'm sorry. I am so sorry. You probably think it's about making love with your socks on, but it isn't. It's about me. And I just The machine cut me off again. Anyway.. I know that some lucky girl is going to become Mrs. Barry Finkel. But it isn't me. It's not me. Not that I have any idea who ""me"" is right now, but you just I'm divorced. - I'm only 26, and I'm divorced! - Shut up! That only took me an hour. We haven't had a relationship that's lasted longer than a Mento. You have had the love of a woman for four years. Four years of closeness and sharing, after which she ripped your heart out. That is why we don't do it! I don't think that was my point! Know what's scary? What if there's only one woman for everybody? I mean, what if you get one woman, and that's it? Unfortunately, in my case, there was only one woman for her. What are you talking about? One woman. That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream. Let me tell you something. There's lots of flavors out there. Rocky road and cookie dough and bing cherry vanilla. You can get them with jimmies or nuts or whipped cream. It's the best thing to happen to you! You got married. You were like, what, 8? Welcome back to the world. Grab a spoon! - I don't know if I'm hungry or horny. - Then stay out of my freezer. Ever since she walked out on me.. What? You wanna spell it out with noodles? It's more of a fifth date kind of revelation. So there's going to be a fifth date? Isn't there? Yeah, yeah. I think there is. What were you going to say? Ever since she left me.. I haven't been able to perform.. sexually. Oh, God! I'm so sorry. Being spit on is probably not what you need right now. How long? - Two years. - Wow. I'm glad you smashed her watch. So you still think you might want that fifth date? Yeah. Yeah, I do. We are gathered here to join Joanie Louise Cunningham.. and Charles. Chachi, Chachi, Chachi.. in the bonds of holy matrimony. See! But Joanie loved Chachi. That's the difference. ""Grab a spoon."" Do you know how long it's been since I grabbed a spoon? Do the words, ""Billy, don't be a hero,"" mean anything to you? Great story. But I gotta go. I got a date with Andrea. Angela. No, Andrea. Andrea's the screamer. Angela has cats. Right, thanks. It's Julie. I'm out of here. Here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough.. to ask a woman out.. who am I going to ask? Isn't this amazing? I've never made coffee in my life. - That is amazing. - Congratulations. If I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do. I think it's, ""If I can invade Poland, there's nothing I can't do."" If you feel like you have to make a Western omelet or something.. Although, actually I'm really not that hungry. Oh, good. Lenny and Squiggy are here. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Morning. - Morning, Paul. - Hello, Paul. - Hi. Paul, is it? - Thank you so much. - Stop. Last night was like all my birthdays, both graduations.. plus the barn-raising scene in Witness. We'll talk later. Thank you. That wasn't a real date. What the hell do you do on a real date? Shut up and put my table back. I've got to get to work. If I don't input those numbers, it doesn't make much of a difference. So, like, you guys all have jobs? Yeah, we all have jobs. That's how we buy stuff. - Yeah, I'm an actor. - Have I seen you in anything? I doubt it. Mostly regional work. Unless you saw the Wee One's production of Pinocchio.. at the little theater in the park? It was a job! ""Look, Geppetto. I'm a real live boy."" - I will not take this abuse. - You're right, I'm sorry. Once I was a wooden boy A little wooden boy You should both know that he's a dead man. Oh, Chandler! How are you doing today? Sleep okay? Did you talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling. I see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth. I know. He's just so.. - Remember you and Tony Demarco? - Oh, yeah. Well, it's like that. With feelings. - Wow, are you in trouble! - Big time! Want a wedding dress? Hardly used. I think we're getting a little ahead of ourselves. I'm going to get up, go to work, and not think about him all day. Or else I'm going to get up and go to work. - Wish me luck! - What for? I'm gonna go get one of those job things. - Hi, Monica. - Franny, welcome back. - How was Florida? - You had sex, didn't you? - How do you do that? - I hate you. I'm pushing my aunt through Parrot Jungle, you're having sex. So, who? You know Paul? Paul, the wine guy? Yeah, I know Paul. You mean, you know Paul like I know Paul? What? I take credit for Paul. Before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years. Of course it was a line. Why would anybody do something like that? I assume we want an answer more sophisticated than: ""To get you into bed."" I hate men. Don't hate. You don't want to put that out into the universe. Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs.. and men with emotional problems can hear? Come here. Give me your feet. I just thought he was nice, you know? I can't believe you didn't know it was a line. - Guess what? - You got a job? Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing. - I was laughed out of 12 interviews. - You're surprisingly upbeat. You'd be too, if you found these boots on sale.. 50% off. How well you know me. They're my ""I don't need a job.. I've got great boots"" boots. - How did you pay? - Credit card. And who pays for that? My father. Is this really necessary? I can stop charging any time. You can't live off your parents. I know that. That's why I was getting married. Give her a break. It's hard being on your own. Thank you. I remember when I first came to this city, I was 14. Mom had killed herself, stepdad was in jail. I didn't know anybody here. I ended up living with this albino guy who was cleaning windshields. And then he killed himself. Then I found aromatherapy. So I know exactly how you feel. The word you're looking for is: ""Anyway.."" - You ready? - No, how can I be ready? ""Ready to jump out of the plane with no parachute?"" - I can't do this. - I know you can. - No. - You made coffee, you can do anything. Cut. Cut. Cut. You know what? I think we can leave it at that. - Kind of a symbolic gesture. - Rachel, that was a library card. If you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream. Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it. That's it. Are you going to crash on the couch? - No, I gotta go home sometime. - Are you gonna be okay? Look what I just found on the floor. What? That's Paul's watch. Just put it back where you found it. Oh, boy! All right. - Good night, everybody. - Good night. - I'm sorry. Have it, I don't want it. - Split it? You probably didn't know this, but in high school.. I had a major crush on you. I knew. You did? I figured you thought I was Monica's geeky brother. I did. Listen, do you think..? Try not to let my vulnerability become a factor here. Do you think it would be okay if I asked you out sometime? Yeah. Maybe. Okay. Okay, maybe I will. - Good night. - Good night. See you. Wait, wait. What's with you? I just grabbed a spoon. - I can't believe what I'm hearing. - Can't believe what I'm hearing - What? I said -  What? I said - Would you stop? - Was I doing it again? Yes! I said you had a nice butt. It's just not a great butt. - You won't know a butt if it bit you. - There's an image. Would anybody like more coffee? You made it, or you're serving it? - I'm just serving it. - I'll have a cup of coffee. Kids, new dream. I'm in Las Vegas. Miss, more coffee? Could you give this to that guy over there? Go ahead. Thank you. Sorry. Okay, Las Vegas. I'm in Las Vegas. I'm Liza Minnelli.. <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"
1010,"This cake is amazing! My God, get a room. I would get a room with this cake. I think I could show this cake a good time. If you had to, what would you give up, food or sex? Sex. Seriously, answer faster. Oh, I'm sorry, honey. But when she said ""sex,"" I wasn't thinking about sex with you. It's like a giant hug. Ross, how about you? Which would you give up? Food. How about sex or dinosaurs? Oh, my God, it's like <i>Sophie's Choice</i>. Oh, God. What about you, Joe? What would you give up, sex or food? I don't know, it's too hard. No, you gotta pick one. Food. No, sex. Food. Sex. Food. Sex... I don't know! Oh, God, I want both! I want... I want girls on bread! The One Where Chandler Gets Caught - You gotta see these pictures of Emma. - Oh, how cute! - She looks just like a little doll. - Oh, no, that is a doll. Oh, thank God, because that thing's really creepy. Look, there's Chandler. Who's the blond? She's pretty. He's having an affair. He is not having an affair! I'm always right about these things. No, you're not. Last week, you thought Ross was trying to kill you. Well, sorry, but it's hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull... ...just to tell it. There's something going on with them. Look! He's getting into the car with her. That doesn't mean anything. Oh, yeah? Well, let's see. Okay, duck down. - Hello? <i>- Hi, Chandler. It's Phoebe.</i> <i>I know that Monica is working today...</i> ...so I was wondering if you wanted to come to the movies with me and Rachel. Oh, I have to work too. Yeah, I'm stuck here at the office all day. Well, it's a shame that you'll miss the movie... ...because we were gonna see, you know, either <i>Liar Liar</i>... ...or <i>Betrayal</i> or <i>An Affair to Remember</i>. Those are all really old. Okay, then maybe it'll be... <i>Dude, Where's My Car?</i> - What? - They're in a car. Okay. Well, talk to you later, okay? Bye. Jeez! Okay, quick. We gotta find a cab and follow them. Yeah, okay. Let me just grab my night-vision goggles and my stun gun. I got them. - Hey. - Hey. Hi, sweetie. Hey, you smell like perfume and cigarettes. - I was in the car with Nancy. - Nancy doesn't smoke. Well, at least the perfume's not mine. Be thankful for that. So... What did you think of the house? It's everything we've been looking for. Isn't it? And what about the amazing wanes coating... ...the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic? And the wiggle woms and the zip zorps! What were the things you said? - Don't you love the huge yard? - The fireplace in the bedroom. And Nancy said it's really underpriced... ...because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents! This is bringing out a lovely color in you. So do you think we should get it? I don't know. What do you think? - I think we should. - I do too. This is huge. How bad do you wanna smoke right now? I don't know what you mean, giant, talking cigarette. Phoebe called as I was getting into Nancy's car. If she asks you, I was at work all day. Got you. When do we tell them? We don't. Not until it's 100 percent. Why upset everybody over nothing? Okay. Right. - Oh, my God, that is gonna be so hard. - I know. Good luck with it. I just can't see Chandler cheating. I'm telling you guys, we followed them out to a house in Westchester. They went in for 45 minutes, and then they came out looking pretty happy. Chandler? Forty-five minutes? Well, something's not right. I can't believe he'd do this to Monica. I know, and with the baby coming? - So should we tell her? - I don't know. If one of us saw Mike with another woman, would you want us to tell you? Why? Who'd you see him with? - No one. I'm just saying if we did... - Tell me what you know! No one! Nothing! Mike's a great guy! It was hypothetical! All right. He is a good guy. You're right. He wouldn't cheat. If I did see him with someone, there's no way l... Who did you see him with? Oh, look at her. So happy. If only there were a smaller one to clean this one. Hey, is Chandler here? No, he's picking up dinner. Why? What's up? Look, whatever happens, we're here for you, and we love you. - All right. - Chandler might be having an affair. - What? - Phoebe and I saw Chandler... ...with a blond woman today outside on the street. And then we followed them to a house in Westchester. They went in together. I'm so sorry. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, that's awful. What did you think of the house? What? Monica, you understand what we're saying, right? Yeah. Sure. I mean, I'm devastated, obviously. Did you think the neighborhood was homey? - Hey. - You son of a bitch. Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here? Phoebe and Rachel saw you with Nancy today. They think you're having an affair. - Who's Nancy? - What's going on? Okay... All right, you better sit down. - This is... This is pretty big. - Yeah. I'm not having an affair. Nancy is our realtor. I knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes! Why do you have a realtor? She's been showing us houses outside of the city. - What? - Are you serious? When we found out that we were gonna get this baby... ...Chandler and I decided we didn't want to raise a kid in the city. So you're... So you're gonna move? Oh, my God. Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this? What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it. Ross is doing it. Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it! And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swing set. A street where our kids can ride their bikes... ...and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by. So you want to buy a house in the '50s. Have you thought about what you're giving up? You can't move out of the city. What if...? What if you want Chinese food at 5 a.m.? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains? Or an Asian hooker sent right to your door? You know what? If you want to look for a house, that's okay. No! No, it's not! Don't listen to him. I'm gonna thump you. It's okay, because they have to get it out of their system. Okay? But you're gonna realize this is the only place you want to be. Actually... ...we already found a house we love. - What? - About an hour ago, we made an offer. Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh? - You put an offer on a house? - It's so sweet. It really is. It has this big yard that leads down to this stream. And then there's these old maple trees. Oh, again with the nature. What are you, beavers? Look, I know this is really hard, and we're really sorry. Is this because I come over here without knocking and eat your food? Because I can stop doing that. I really, really think I can. You know that's not the reason, Joe. I think if you saw it, you'd understand. You guys were there. It's beautiful, isn't it? - Yeah, it is. - What the hell are you doing? Well, it is, all right? When we were out there today, all I kept thinking was: ""I can't believe Chandler's screwing this woman... ...but, man, this would be a nice place to live!"" Yeah, but so is this. Yeah. I mean, if you move there, you have to leave here. I mean, how can you leave this place? Come on, Daddy, listen! All my life, everyone's always told me, ""You're a shoe!"" ""You're a shoe! You're a shoe. You're a shoe!"" I stopped and said, ""What if I don't want to be a shoe? What if I want to be a purse? Or a hat?"" I don't want you to buy me a hat, l... It's a metaphor, Daddy! You can see where he'd have trouble. Well, maybe I'll just stay here with Monica. I guess we've established she's staying with Monica. Your money's mine, Greene. Your fly's open, Geller. You know what I just realized? ""Joker"" is ""poker"" with a ""J""! Coincidence? That's ""joincidence"" with a ""C""! Look! Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles. That had to hurt! Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too. Instead of watching football, you could help. We know. Rachel, you want to put the marshmallows in concentric circles. No, Mon. You want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this. Every year. It's stuck! Step. How did it get on? I put it on to scare Chandler. Oh, my God! Monica's going to totally freak out! Plus, it smells really bad in here. Of course it smells bad. You have your head up a turkey's ass. Monica. Did you get the turkey...? Oh, my God! Who is that? It's Joey. I got it! If we win, they have to get rid of the rooster. That's interesting! If you win... ...we give up the bird. But if we win... ...we get your apartment. - Deal! - What? ""Monica's nickname when she was a hockey goalie?"" - Big Fat Goalie. - Correct! ""Rachel claims it's her favorite movie."" <i>Dangerous Liaisons</i>. - ""Her actual favorite movie is...?"" <i>- Weekend at Bernie's</i>. ""Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?"" - Everyday use. - Fancy. - Guest. - Fancy guest. - Two seconds. - Eleven? Unbelievable! Eleven is correct. ""Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl's breast?"" - 14? - No, 19. Thanks, man. ""Joey had an imaginary childhood friend. - His name was...?"" - Maurice! - ""His profession was...?"" - Space cowboy! ""What is Chandler Bing's job?"" Ten seconds. You need this or you lose. Something to do with transponding. He's a transponster! That's not even a word! You are mean boys who are just being mean! Don't get mad! No one forced you to raise the stakes. That is not true! She forced me! You got the question wrong. It was a stupid, unfair question! Don't blame the questions! Stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us. Chandler! I saw what you were doing in the window! I saw what you're doing to my sister! Get out here! Listen, we had a good run. What was it? Four, five months? That's more than most people have in a lifetime. Goodbye. Hey, Ross. What's up, bro? What the hell are you doing? What's going on? I think Ross knows about me and Monica. Dude, he's right there. I thought you were my best friend! This is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this! We're not just messing around. I love her. I'm in love with her. I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's true. I love him too. My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this! This is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it ""What were you thinking?"" I was gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler. Guys, I don't wanna make things worse, but... ...I don't want to live with Rachel anymore. You're so mean to each other. I don't wanna end up like that with Rachel. I still like you. That's fine because I'm not moving. Phoebe, you gotta take her. I said some bad stuff... ...but Rachel has qualities that make her a good roommate. She gets tons of catalogs and folds down the pages of things I'd like. What else? When I take a shower... ...she leaves me notes on the mirror. I do. I do do that. That's nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom. When I fall asleep on the couch... ...she covers me with a blanket. Well, you know, I don't want you to be cold. And when I told her that I was gonna move in with Chandler... ...she was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy! - She really left. - I know. - Thank you. - No problem, roomie. - Can I ask you a question? - Sure. What the hell is that dog doing here? A little toast here. Ding, ding! This isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving you planned... ...but for me this has been really great. I think because it didn't involve divorce... ...or projectile vomiting. If you had gone to Vail... ...or if you had been with your family, or if you didn't have... ...syphilis and stuff... ...we wouldn't be all together. So I guess what I'm trying to say is... ...that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked. - That's so sweet! - Thank you. Here's to a lousy Christmas! And a crappy New Year! - Hear, hear! - Hear, hear! You can't move. You just... You just can't. Rachel's right. This is where you guys belong. You don't wanna live in Westchester. That's the worst of the Chesters. You know, sometimes when I'm alone in my apartment, I look over here... ...and you guys are just having dinner... ...or watching TV or something... ...but it makes me feel better. And now when I look over, who am I gonna see? The Gottliebs? The Yangs? They don't make me feel so good. Yeah. So don't move, okay? Just stay here... ...and maybe close your blinds at night. - Hey. Hello? It's Nancy. They responded to our offer. And? Okay. Thanks. They passed. They said they won't go a penny under the asking price. - We can't afford that. - I know. Well, there you go. I'm really sorry, you guys. Yeah, I'm sorry too. I'm even more sorry that phone call didn't come... ...before I told you about looking through the window. Yeah. Well, we're gonna let you be alone. - You gonna be okay? - Yeah, we'll be okay. Love you guys. You know, I'm really sorry I wasn't more supportive before. That's okay. We understand. Yeah, and about this Nancy... If you're not sleeping with her, should I? I know there'll be other houses, but I just... - I love that one so much. - Yeah. Well, it's a good thing we got it then. - What? - We got the house. - Oh, my God. - I didn't wanna tell you in front of them. We got it?! We got the house?! We're getting a house! - We're getting a house. - And a baby. We're growing up. We sure are. - Who's gonna tell them? - Not it! Not it! Damn it! Rachel, this is yours. Why? What are these for? - You'll see. - All right, everybody open them. Wow, this is so beautiful! These are the ones I was looking at in the store! - I know. - Oh, I love this! A meatball sub! Thanks! Seriously, guys, what's going on? What are these for? Well, I didn't know how to tell you before... ...but we got the house. - Enjoy! What did they say?

She dumped him for Michael Skloff. Did I go to this school? Hey, there's Missy Goldberg. You gotta remember her. Sure. Nice. Dude, you're married to my sister. You're right.

Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact. Thank you. Here I go. Hey, remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college? - Your hands are shaking. - I know.

Gene, you won the toss, so you'll start. Which category? - ""You Crossed the Line."" - ""You Crossed the Line."" Joey... ...describe for Gene these things that have lines. Give me 20 seconds on the clock, please. Ready? Go. Okay, it's a store like a supermarket. I see what I did there. Okay, okay. I'm writing in my... - Diary. - No, more like a notebook. If I'm building a house, the plan... ...isn't called a ""shmooprint""... I can't do that either? In high school, I once had sex with a girl right in the middle of the...? - Cafeteria? - Yeah, but they're not looking for that. - Thank you so much for this. - You like it? Oh, my God, it's all so elegant. When's the dirty stuff starting? - What? - The strippers and the guys dancing... ...and, you know, pee-pees flying about. Pheebs, I... There isn't gonna be any ""flying about."" We thought we were a little too mature for stuff like that. Oh, okay. I see what you're doing. That's fine. This is all there is. Just tea. Okay. Raunchy. Seriously, Pheebs, it's not gonna be that kind of a party. Really? So this is...? This is my big sendoff into married life? Rachel, this is the only bachelorette party I'm ever gonna have. I've got a big wad of ones in my purse. Really? I mean, really? It's just tea? No. - Phoebe, of course there's more. - Okay. I mean, let me just go talk to Monica... ...and get an ETA on the pee-pees. Now, Gene, I must remind you, you need all six of these to stay in the game. Describe for Joey ""things you find in your refrigerator."" They might as well just give us the points. Give me 20 seconds on the clock. Ready? Go. - You put this in your coffee. - A spoon. Your hands. Your face. - It's white. - Paper. Snow. A ghost! - It's heavier than milk. - A rock. A dog. The Earth. Pass. - You put it on a sandwich. - Salami. Anchovies. Jam. - It's white. - Paper. Snow. A ghost! - It's made from eggs. - Chickens? Pass. - You put this on a hamburger. - Ketchup! Relish! Stop! Oh, time's up. Well, Joey, you were... ...almost on a roll there. Gene... ...you'll have a chance to go to the Winner's Circle, but now... ...Henrietta, you're going to the Winner's Circle to try your luck for $ 10,000... ...right after this. Don't go away. And we're out. Oh, so we didn't win. But it's fun to play the game, right? I got a kid starting college. I have to get surgery on my knee. You just lost me 10 grand. Oh, wow. I'm so sorry. Okay, I promise, we'll do better next time. Well, I will, because I won't be playing with you. Hey, some of those are pretty hard. Like, why would there be a ghost in my fridge? Yeah. - So Saturday night? - I'd love to. Great. So how come it took you so long to ask me out? Oh, well, this is gonna sound kind of silly... ...but do you remember my roommate, Chandler Bing? Sure. He was in your ""band."" It's been 16 years, but the air quotes still hurt. - Sorry. - That's okay. Anyway... Well, he and I both really liked you a lot... ...but we didn't want it to jeopardize our friendship, so we made a pact... ...that neither of us could ask you out. - Really? - Yeah, why? Well, Chandler and I used to make out. A lot. - You did? - Yeah. - We'd go to the science lab after-hours. - And on my turf?! Hey, where is this guy? It's been over an hour. He's coming from Jersey. He said he'd get here as fast as he could. - Who is it? - It's the police. The police! That's right. It's Officer Goodbody. What's the matter, officer? Has someone been bad? That's a lot of stairs. Boy. You should warn people there's no elevator. I should not have had that Mexican food for lunch. Are you gonna be okay, Officer...? - Goodbody. - lf you say so. So where's the young lady... ...who I am supposed to take downtown? Oh, God. All right. Somebody show me where to plug in my box... ...and we'll get this party started. - Over here? - Yeah. - All right. - Rachel? - Yeah? - Are you kidding? We didn't know you wanted a stripper, so we got the phone book... ...and got the first name we could find. - How old's your phone book? Oh, my God, this man is gonna get naked in my apartment. God, no. I don't wanna see him take his clothes off. Are you talking about me? No. I mean, obviously we wanna see you take your clothes off. You big piece of eye candy. Okay. Okay, ladies, can I have your attention, please? Oh, yeah. Did someone call for the long arm of the law? I should warn you, I have a concealed weapon. I hope you're familiar with this state's penal code. Okay, okay. Enough teasing. Now for some pleasing. She cringed. This is how I look when I'm turned-on. You were talking about me before. Look, I don't need this. I'm out of here. Where's my hat? Look, I've been in this business for a long time. Shocking. Now, if you'll just pay me my $300, I'll be on my way. - $300? Are you kidding? - That's okay. Let me get my checkbook. You're not gonna pay him. He didn't do anything. Didn't do anything? I took a bus all the way from Hoboken. I climbed, I don't know, like, a billion stairs. And it's not like I can take them two at a time. I don't care. We're not paying you $300 for this. It's not my fault if you're too uptight to appreciate... ...the male form in all its glory. Okay, I'm uptight. That's why I don't wanna watch a middle-aged guy... ...dance around in what I can only assume is a child's Halloween costume. I may have borrowed this from my nephew... ...but let me assure you, what's underneath is all man. I'm sorry, did you say ""all man"" or ""old man""? You're mean. - Look, officer... Sir? - Damn it. Big surprise. The hunk of beef has feelings. Applause. Okay, Henrietta, you picked ""Jack and Jill Went Up The Hill."" My friend Rachel has a kid. I totally know nursery rhymes. Joey, describe these things associated with the United States Congress. Give me 20 seconds on the clock, please. Ready? Go. Pass. Pass. Pass. - The thing hanging in your throat. - Uvula. Then pass. Okay. Henrietta, you didn't get all the points you needed... ...so that means, Gene, you are going to the Winner's Circle to try for $ 10,000. And you're gonna be going there with Joey Tribbiani. You made out with Missy Goldberg? How could you do that after you promised me? Excuse me. That didn't make us sound gay at all. - You broke the pact. - Ross, that was 16 years ago. That doesn't matter. We're talking about the foundation of our friendship. I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair. If we're really gonna do this, it's not like you never broke one of the pacts. - I didn't. - Oh, really? - No. - Oh, really? - No. - Adrienne Turner. Yes? - Hey, Adrienne. - Hey, Adrienne. Hey. I never did anything with Adrienne Turner. Oh, please. And you knew how much I liked her. I don't know what you're talking about. Really? Remember that party freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors. I can't believe we're at a real college party. I have to pee so bad. This is so awesome. College guys are so cute. - Hey, you've got a boyfriend. - I know. But if a guy who looks like Corey Haim wants to kiss me, I am so gonna let him. Hey, look, there's Chandler. That stupid friend of Ross' who said I was fat. - I've already lost four pounds. - You can so totally tell. I know! Well, let's see, maybe he knows where Ross is. Hey, how's it going? - Aren't you...? - Yeah, Rachel. And this is Ross' sister, Monica. We met at Thanksgiving. Right. So how you doing? Bitchen. - Hi, Monica. - Hi, Chandler. It's really nice to see you. Not! Okay. I'll see if I can find Ross. Oh, my God, Rach. Beanbag chairs. Do not let me sit in one of those. We'll be here for days. Listen, Adrienne, you can't tell Chandler about this. Oh, believe me, Ross, I won't be telling anybody about this. Cool. I didn't know you knew about that. Well, I did. And it hurt. That's when I wrote the song ""Betrayal in the Common Room."" Man, I'm sorry. Look, that was a long time ago. So I made out with Adrienne, and you made out with Missy. Well, I guess we're even. We are even, right? One more thing. I was so pissed at you that night, I wanted to get back at you. So I thought, ""Who does Ross like more than anybody?"" What did you do to my mom? Not her. I am so drunk. That's weird. I've had the same number of beers as you and don't feel anything. So you girls having fun? For your information, ass-munch... ...I've lost four pounds. Maybe even five with all the dancing. - Somebody order a pizza? - Oh, that's me! I am so not gonna do good on my SATs tomorrow. Well, maybe you could go to school here next year and we could totally hang out. Oh, yeah. There's a plan. Why don't I just start taking my smart pills now. Well, maybe you could get in on a beauty scholarship. What a line. - So where are you applying to? - Well... ...I think it's kind of really important that I go somewhere where there's sun. So I'm sort of... Hey! I'm in college, and I'm in a band. Yeah, okay. What's the matter? You never saw a 50-year-old stripper cry before? You know, it's fine. We'll pay you. No, no, you're right. Who am I kidding? I should have hung up that breakaway jockstrap years ago. What am I gonna do? I mean... ...this has been my life for 32 years. Taking my clothes off in front of people is all I know. No, there's got to be something else that you can do. I mean, what skills do you have? I don't know. I can make my pecs dance. I can pick up a dollar bill with my butt cheeks. I can go to that special place inside me where I feel no shame. So maybe something in an office. Or you could... You could teach stripping. You know, share your gift. Pass the torch. You know, actually, that's not a bad idea. I could do it out of my apartment. I don't think my mom would mind. There you go. Okay. You think you're gonna be okay? - Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah. This is so weird. You never know when it's gonna be your last dance. And I didn't even get a chance to finish it. Finish it. - What? - Your last dance. Do it for us. - Really? - Really? Yeah. Yeah, he deserves to do the thing he loves one last time. Okay. All right. Get ready, ladies. Okay. Oh, this is so hot! Oh, no, don't stop. Have to. Welcome to the Winner's Circle. Joey, Gene, you guys ready? - Yeah. - Sure. Okay. Give me 60 seconds on the clock, please. Ready? Go. Oak. Maple. Elm. Birch. I don't know. Types of trees...? <i>Buenos das.</i> Enchilada. <i>Por favor.</i> Oh, I'm so sorry, I don't know any Spanish words. A match. A candle. Things that go: when you put them out. A torch. A bonfire. - Your pee. - Things that burn. ""I'd like to go for a walk."" ""Scratch my belly."" Dude. Dude, I think you're losing it. ""I have fur."" ""I like to bark."" What a dog says. - Pepperoni. - Pizza toppings! Cindy Crawford. Christie Brinkley. Heidi Klum. Claudia Schiffer. Christy Turlington. Kate Moss. Girls Chandler could never get? - Supermodels. - Where? Hey. Where's Rachel? She and Phoebe took the stripper to the hospital. Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel? - What? When was this? - 1987. The weekend you guys visited me at school. - Oh, my God. That's wild. - But it was, like, a million years ago. - It doesn't matter. - It matters to me. - Why? - Because the night you kissed Rachel... ...was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time. - You kissed her that night too? - Two guys in one night? Oh, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed. - Seriously, where did this happen? - Okay... ...after you told me she was passed out in our room... ...I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all buried in people's coats. I went to kiss her on the forehead... ...but it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but it was amazing. And now I find out that you kissed her first. - Wait, what bed did you say she was on? - Mine. - I'm sure I put her on my bed. - No, she was definitely on my bed. Why would I kiss a girl and then put her on your bed? Well, then who was on my bed? No! No! Yes! - You were under the pile of coats? - I was the pile of coats! Oh, my God! You were my midnight mystery kisser?! You were my first kiss with Rachel?! You were my first kiss ever?! What did I marry into?! Crap!

1012,"Oh, hey, Joey. - Hey. - Listen, I need to ask you something. You know how my stepdad's in prison? - Yeah. - Yeah. He was supposed to get a weekend furlough so he could go to the wedding. But he just called and... Well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the exercise yard couldn't wait till Monday. - So he can't come? - No. And so there's no one to walk me down the aisle. And... Well, I would just really love it if you would do it. - Seriously? - Yeah. You've, you know, sort of been like a dad to me. You've always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom. I am pretty ""wisdomous."" So, what do you say? Are you kidding? Phoebe, I would be honored. Oh, thank you. I hope... I hope you know how much you mean to me. Listen, I hope... I hope that you know... I don't want you to see your father cry. Go to your room! Oh, no, no, no. Let your dad get this. It's my wedding planner. She's driving me crazy! Hello? Okay, stop screaming! Okay, so halibut. All right, so salmon. Either way. I don't... - It doesn't matter to me. - Well, it matters to me! Well, I don't care. So you pick. Did you just hang up on me? All right, look, I need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours. Okay. What time is that? You don't know military time? I must have been in missile training the day they taught that. Just subtract 12. Okay, so 1800 minus 12... ...is 1788. - Six o'clock! - Okay. Hold on. Yeah? Geller here. No, I said it has to be there by 4:00. Goodbye. How hard is it to make an ice sculpture? That sounds really fancy. I told you, I just want a simple wedding. Please, honey, leave the details to me. Now, I wanna make this day as special for you as I can. I was thinking the harpist should wear white. Harpist? My friend Marjorie is playing the steel drums. - Oh, she backed out. - She did? Why? I made her. Steel drums don't really say ""elegant wedding."" - Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent. - Hey! She will shower when Tibet is free. - Hey. You look great. - You too. I'm glad we're having a rehearsal dinner. I rarely practice my meals before I eat. What did we say was your one gift to us? No stupid jokes, but I thought that was for the actual wedding. Rehearse it. Hi. - Thanks for coming, you guys. - Oh, yeah... I was... I was going for a handshake. That why your hand's against my crotch? - That is why. - Yeah. So, Rach, where's Emma? Monica made me send her to my mom's. Apparently, babies and weddings don't mix. Are you still crying about your damn baby? Pheebs, you got to keep the line moving. Remember, 20 seconds per person. You see these clowns all the time. - Hey, you're Mike's parents, right? - Yes, we are. Gosh, our little ones are growing up fast, aren't they? - How's that? - You know... ...on one hand, you're happy for them. On the other, it's hard to let go. Who in God's name are you? I'm not that fond of you either, buddy. I'm just trying to be nice for the kids. You know what? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow. I thought we'd be groomsmen. They would have asked us by now. When did they ask you to be a bridesmaid? - November. - I wanna say it's not looking good. Hey, Pheebs? You haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet. Well, they're not in the wedding. What? Well... ...this is really awkward. Oh, and I can leave. I'm sorry, you guys. But Mike's got his brother and his friends from school. So, you know, you were... If it helps, you were next in line. You just missed the cut. Oh, man. This is like figure skating team all over again. I mean, synchronized swimming. I mean... I mean, the balance beam. - Help me. - Football. Thank you. Oh, Pheebs, spit that out. That has pork in it. I thought the pot stickers were supposed to be vegetarian? Yeah, I changed them. I sent you a fax about it. I don't have a fax machine. Well, then there are gonna be a few surprises. I can't believe we're gonna be the only people not in the wedding. - I know. I hate being left out of things. - And it's a wedding. It'll be weird if I'm not in it. - Hey, guys, how's it going? - Fine. We're sitting here, alone, doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow. Look, about tomorrow, I've got a question for you. I found out one of my groomsmen had an emergency and can't make it. - What happened? - Who cares? And...? And I was wondering if one of you guys... - I'll do it! - Me! You both wanna do it? There's only room for one. Pick me. I look great in a tux, and I won't steal focus. No, Mike. No, no, you wanna pick me. I mean... Watch. You know, I really don't feel very comfortable making this decision. You know, Phoebe knows you better. I'm gonna let her choose. Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman. Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... ...as he is me. - Please. You're going down. - You are going ""downer."" They say that on the figure skating team? I wouldn't know. I didn't make it. You know I'm filling in for Phoebe's stepdad tomorrow, right? - Yeah. Yeah. Hey, thanks for doing that. - Oh, hey, my pleasure. So, what are your intentions with my Phoebe? - I intend to marry her. - Oh, a wiseacre. I understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano? Isn't that kind of unstable? - No more so than acting. - Strike two. You're right. She probably will support me. Hey, unless we move in with you, Dad. Strike three. You only get one more, Mike. So? What did you decide? I decided to pee. You have to choose one of us to be in your wedding. - One of the groomsmen fell out. - Oh, no, no. I can't choose between you two. I love you both so much. Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party. But I don't wanna choose. It's... - Okay, wait. Rach? - Yeah? Listen, I have a very special bridesmaid task for you to do. Goody! What is it? Well, there's a spot open for only one groomsman... ...and you have to choose between Ross and Chandler. So good luck with that. What? What, what, what? No, I don't wanna do that. I guess I have to find a new bridesmaid. I'll do it! Okay, it's 2100 hours. - Time for your toast. - Do I have time to go to the bathroom? You had a bathroom break at 2030. Pee on your own time, Mike. In regards to the toasts, okay, you wanna keep them short. Nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. Okay. You just get in, do your thing, and get out. Is that what you say to Chandler? It's 2101, and I am not amused. Okay. The bride and groom have a few words they'd like to say. Okay. Hello, everyone. And thank you all for being here tonight. So tomorrow's the big event. Some of you might not know, but Mike and I didn't get off to the best start. Yeah. My friend Joey and I... ...decided to fix each other up with friends. So l... Oh, okay. I... I thought about it, and I fixed him up with my friend Mary Ellen... ...who couldn't be here tonight, because... It's not... It's not important. Well, she's in rehab. Anyway. So Joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend Mike... ...only he didn't have a friend Mike, so he just brought my Mike. And... And... But despite, you know... It got good. I wanna take a moment to mention my mother, who couldn't be here. Oh, God. And... And moment's over. So okay... Oh, no, forget that. I can forget that. Oh, this is funny. Oh, but you need to know that to get that. So... Oh, well, okay. I... Okay. Okay, Monica, I can't do it like this! This is my wedding, okay? I don't want this... Or this... Or this... Okay? I just wanted a simple wedding... ...where my fianc can go to the bathroom any time he wants! - You know what? You're done. - What? You're fired! Cheers. - Hey. - Happy wedding day. Happy my wedding day to you. Joey, listen, this is gonna be bridesmaid central, all right? We're gonna have hair and makeup in the bathroom. I had to move a couple things in the fridge to make room for the corsages. Man! I wouldn't have had breakfast if I knew there was gonna be corsages. Hi. About last night... I know you're under a lot of stress, and... Well, even though the things you said hurt me a little bit... My point is... Well, I'm willing to take my job back. Oh, well, that's okay. I think you and I will do much better if you're just here as a bridesmaid. Is that so? Okay. If that's really what you want, then here. I give you the headset. I don't really wanna give you the headset. I guess if you're taking over, then you should probably return these messages. This is a lot. But I'm sure you can handle this. I have won awards... ...for my organizational skills. But I'm sure you'll do fine. - You've won awards? - I printed them out on my computer. - Hey. - Hi. - Where's Rach? - She's in her room. Why? I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation. I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there while I'm in the seats like some chump. My God, you're breathtaking. What do you want? You haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you? Ross, please don't make this harder than it already is. I'm not. I'm making it easier. Pick me. - Chandler said it's important to him too. - Listen. Listen. Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you. Now, I promise I won't say a word. But if you pick Chandler... ...he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time. Oh, you are the lesser of two evils. Yes! Sven, I don't understand what you're saying. What is wrong with the flowers? ""Lorkins""? What the hell are ""lorkins""? I know. - Hey. - Mike, if you were Swedish... ...and you were saying the word ""lorkins,"" what flower would that be? - Orchids? - Right there! That's why I'm marrying you. Hello, Michael. Joseph. May I have a word with you, please? This is... ...great. Have a seat. Last night... ...I tried to welcome you into my family. And instead, you disrespect me. I cannot allow this. Are you rehearsing for some really bad Mafia movie? More back talk. And yes, I may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition... ...for <i>Family Honor 2:</i> <i>This A-Time It's A-Personal.</i> Joey, I kind of have a lot to do today. What do you want? I want you to take this seriously! Phoebe is very, very important to me, okay? I wanna make sure you are gonna take care of her. Joe, I love Phoebe. She's the most important thing in my life. I'd die before I let anything happen to her. That's what I wanted to hear. Because she's family, okay? And now you're gonna be family. And there's nothing more important in the whole world than family. That must have been one lousy movie. That was me! - Hi. - Let's talk about this groomsman thing. If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the aisle just fine. But if you choose me... ...you'll be getting some comedy. Even so... ...I think I'm gonna pick Ross. Let me tell you why you need to pick me. See, when I was a kid, you know, I was always left out of everything... ...and it really made me feel insecure. I was always picked last in gym... ...even behind that fat exchange student who didn't know the rules to baseball. I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway, if I'm the only one left out of this wedding... ...I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back. All right, fine, I pick you. Yes! Make ""groom"" for Chandler. Oh, my. No, we're gonna do it my way. Because your way is stupid. All right, I got to go. I have another call, Reverend. Hello? - I'm glad we had this little talk. - Yes. And thanks for all the wedding night advice. That didn't make me uncomfortable at all. All right, so I'll see everybody tonight. - Okay. - Bye. Did you guys know that there's a giant ice sculpture in the hall? Oh, my God, what's it doing here? I guess it got sent to the billing address as opposed to the shipping address. - What a pickle. - Oh, my God, everything's such a mess. Why is this happening to me? How bad do you wanna stick your tongue on that? - How's it going? - Good. I'm just getting some coffee so I'm alert for the wedding. That's what I was doing too. Well, you have fun tonight. - You too. - Oh, I will. Me too. Wait a minute. I know why I'm being such an ass. Why are you? - I'm not supposed to tell you. - I'm not supposed to tell you. You told us both we could be in the wedding? In my defense, you weren't supposed to tell each other! Rachel, only one of us can do it. You have to choose. You and me together again. Rach, Rach? Knock-knock. - Who's there? - I'll tell you at the wedding. Hey, I forgot my scarf. I can't do this. I don't know which one of you guys to pick. Oh, you haven't picked yet? Oh, good, because I had an idea. I thought it would be fun if the third groomsman was my family dog, Chappy. What? A dog? No. Rachel gets to choose. Wow, this is a tough one. I think I'm gonna have to go with the dog. So, what you're saying is that the chef is at the Hamilton Club... ...but the food is not? And the drinks are there but the bartender is not? Are you freaking kidding me? How's it going? - Help me. - What? I want you to be crazy bitch again. Really? Please? - You really want me to come back? - More than I wanna get married. Okay, people, we are back in business! Oh, God, I have missed you so much. Okay. Get your hair and makeup done. I'll take care of everything. - Hey, what are you guys gonna do? - About what? The blizzard. I just saw on the news... ...it's the worst snowstorm in 20 years. They already closed all the bridges and tunnels. But the band and the photographer are coming in from New Jersey. I don't think they are. Looks like you're not gonna be in the wedding, either. So sorry, Pheebs. - Well, the club lost its power. - The news said most of the city did. - Since when do you watch the news? - For your information... ...since they hired a very hot weather girl. I can't believe you aren't getting married today. I know. It's so beautiful out there. You always wanted to get married outside. - Why don't you just do it on the street? - What? Well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore. I mean, you couldn't ask for a more romantic setting. This could be the simple wedding you've always wanted. What do you think? I think I wanna get married to you today. Me too. Monica, do you think we could do it? Affirmative! Okay, let's get these chairs out here! Gunther, hit the Christmas lights. Okay, who left the ice sculpture on the steam grate? - Michael. - Hey, you made it. Great. Chappy! - There you go. - Hi. Hi. I know getting married in the street isn't what you approve of. No, it's lovely. The lights and the snow. I could look at them forever. I crushed a pill and put it in her drink. Come on, sweetheart. You know, Chappy's too small to handle all this snow. Someone has to walk him down the aisle. - Would this person be in the wedding? - I guess. - I'll do it! - I'll do it! Chandler, hello? I mean, aren't you scared of dogs? I'm not scared. I'll just take little Chappy and... He can sense my fear! My throat is exposed! I guess I'm in the wedding then. He stinks. Level one alert! I repeat, level one, this is not a drill! We have a situation. The minister called. He's snowed in, he can't make it. - Oh, no. - Hey, don't worry. - I'm still ordained from your wedding. - Really? Yeah. You think I'd give up being a minister and pay to ride the subway? Ministers don't ride the subway for free. I had to read the Bible pretty carefully, but, yeah, we do. We have to find someone else to walk Phoebe down the aisle. I'll do it! Okay, Mike and Joey, get in position. Chandler, come with me. Okay, Joey's doing the ceremony, and Chandler's giving you away. Oh, okay. Hi, new Dad. So you ready to do this? Oh, my God. This is really happening. - Phoebe, I'm so happy for you, honey. - Thank you. I love you. Wait, wait! No hugs!

Why are you standing there? Where's your bridesmaid? We've got a broken arrow! Bridesmaid down! Oh, that's me. - Ready? - Okay. Oh, wait. Oh, no. Wait. Wow. Aren't you gonna be cold? I don't care.

The cold has now spread to my special place... ...so I'm gonna do the short version of this. Phoebe and Mike are perfect for each other. And I know I speak for everyone here... ...when I wish them a lifetime of happiness. Who has the rings? Okay. When I was growing up, I didn't have a normal mom and dad... ...or a regular family like everybody else. And I always knew that something was missing. But now I'm standing here today... ...knowing that I have everything I'm ever gonna need. You are my family. Phoebe, you are so beautiful. You're so kind. You're so generous. You're so wonderfully weird. Every day with you is an adventure. And I can't believe how lucky I am. And I can't wait to share my life with you forever. Oh, wait! Oh, I forgot. And... ...I love you. And you have nice eyes. I love you too. - Joey? - Yeah? Chappy's heart rate has slowed way down. Okay. Phoebe... ...do you take this man to be your husband? I do. Mike, do you take this woman to be your wife? I do. I now pronounce you... ...husband and wife. I got married! Could someone get me a coat? I'm frigging freezing. - It really was an incredible wedding. - It was. I kind of don't want it to end. Hey... ...you wanna come in for a drink and a bite of corsage? I'd love to, but it's 2300 hours... ...and I'm about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had. - Whatever happened to Ross? - I don't know. Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he talked to. Come on, Chappy! Do your business! Make! Make! I did not sign on for this. Subtitles by SDI Media Group [ENGLISH] <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"

Oh, he's at the doctor's, he didn't poop the whole time we were there. Well, anyway, I'm glad you're back. I really need your help. Oh, why? What's up? Well, I have an audition for this play and for some of them would have to speak French, which according to my resume, I'm fluent in. Joey, you shouldn't lie on your resume. Yeah, you really shouldn't! BTW, how was that year-long dig in Cairo? It was ok. I did not know you spoke French. Oh, you're so sexy. Well, so will you help me? I really wanna be in this play. Sure. Seriously, stop or I'm gonna jump on you.

Why are you wearing my apron? I'm making cookies for Erica. Oh, btw, we have to leave for the airport soon. Her plane comes in ahout an hour. Oh hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as my wife and the woman who's carrying my child? No? Divorce? Hey. Do you guys know where Rachel is? No, we haven't seen her since this morning. Unbelievable! She was supposed to meet me half an hour ago with Emma. Hey! These are for Erica! Well, is she gonna eat all those cookies? I want the baby to come out all cute and fat. So why is Erica coming to visit you? Because we want to get to know her better and... she's never been to NY, so she wants to see all the tourist spots, you know, Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building... Oh, those places. There's always so many people there being crowd like cattle, and, you know, there's always some idiot who goes ""Moo"". Well, if it annoys you so much, then why do you do it? Oh hi, thanks for showing up 30 minutes late! - Ross... - No no, I'm sure you have a great excuse. What, was it a hair appointment? A mani-pedi or is there a sale at Barney's? My father had a heart attack... while I was at Barney's. - Oh my god. - Honey. I'm so sorry. Is he ok? Yeah, they said he's gonna be fine. But he's still having sedated. Ok, I'm gonna come out to Long Island with you, I mean, you can't be alone right now. No, come on, I'm totally ok. I don't need you to come. I can totally handle this on my own. Still, still, let me come... for me. Ok, if you really need to. I bet someone could use one of Monica's freshly baked cookies. Oh, I really could. Alright, this seems pretty simple. Your first line is ""My name is Claude."" So, just repeat after me. Well, so let's try it again. Huh, it's not... quite what I'm saying. Really? It sounds exactly the same to me. It does? Really? Alright, let's just try it again. - Really listen. - Got it. Hey, you guys! I want you to meet someone really special. Phoebe, this is Erica, and this is the baby. Joey, Erica, Baby. Everyone! Erica, Baby. Monica, calm, self. - Please, sit down. - Thank you. It's really nice to meet you guys. I can't believe I'm here. Well, welcome to NYC, or should I say ... Why would you say that? Ok, what are you gonna be doing today? Oh, I want to see everything. Time Square, Coney Island, Rockefeller Center... Oh, you know what you should do, you should walk all the way to the top of Statue of Liberty. - Oh yeah, let's do that! - Great. This baby better be really good. Hi, excuse me. I'm here to see my father. My name is Rachel Green. And I'm Dr Ross Galler. Ross, please. This is a hospital, ok? That actually means sth here. - So, can we plase go in? - Absolutely. Rach, I think I'm gonna wait out here because... my throat is feeling a little scratchy, I don't wanna infect him. Ross, please, don't be so scared of him. I am not scared of him, I'm really sick. He's still under sedation, so he's pretty much out. I'm feeling better. Oh, my god. Oh, wow, that ear and nose hair trimmer I got him was just money down the drain, huh? Miss Green, your father's doctor is on the phone if you'd like to speak to him. Oh, great. Uh, are you gonna be ok? He's unconscious, I think we'll be just fine. Did the TV wake you? No, when you put your feet up on my bed, you tucked on my cathode. Ouchy. What are you doing here, Galler? Well, I came with Rachel who should be back any second. So what's new? Ooh, I had a little heart attack. Great, is it painful? What? A heart attack is sitting here talking to you. Let's see if we can get Rachel back in here. So what's new with you, huh? Knocked up any more of my daughters laterly? Nope! Just the one. Rach! Noo! Ok, maybe if we just break it down. Ok, let's just try one syllable at a time. Ok, so repeat after me. Great, ok, faster. Ok, it's too hard, I can't teach you! What are you doing? I have to go before pull your head through a wall! No, no! Don't go, I need you. My audition is tomorrow! Hey. I was gonna make some dinner but all I found in your dad's frige was bacon and heavy cream. I think we solve the mystery of heart attack. Did you call your parents? - Oh, yeah, Emma is doing great. - Oh, good. Wow. What? Just can't believe I'm in Rachel Green's room. What do you mean? You have been in my room before. Yeah, sure, right. Like I have ever been in Rachel Green's room. Ok, I gotta tell you, it's really weird when you use my whole name. Sorry. - Are you ok? - Yeah. 'Yeah' to a rough day, huh? Yeah, it's just so weird seeing him like that, you know? I mean, he's a doctor, you don't expect doctors to get sick. But we do. You know, he's gonna be ok, Rach. Oh, I don't want him to wake up alone, I should go to the hospital. What? No, no, wait. Hey hey, look. They gave him a lot medication, ok, he wouldn't even know if you were there. Look, we'll go and see him the first thing in the morning, ok? - Really? I shouldn't feel guilty? - No, God. Hey. Rach, you've been an amazing doughter, ok? Right now, you just need to get some rest. Ok, maybe you're right. Good night. Wait, wait. Would you stay here with me for a while? Sure. Thank you for coming with me today. Oh, of course. Rachel Green is very happy you're in her room. Me, too. Come here. I just don't want to be alone tonight. Ok, well, I can, maybe grab a sleeping bag or... No, Rach! I'm sorry, I just don't think this is a good idea. We won't know that until we do it, will we? No, uh look, uhm... You are upset about your father and you're feeling vulnerable. And I just don't feel it will be right if I'd like be, you know, taking advantage of you. What taking advantage? I'm giving you the advantage, enjoy! Ok, I'm sure it would be great but... I think one of us has to be thinking clearly, so I'm gonna go. I'll see you in the morning. Haven't had sex in 4 months, I should get a medal for that! Thanks so much for taking me to all these places, I had a great time. Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I want to apologize about Chandler, though. I just did not see this coming. NY is awesome! What is with you? You know, I've been to these before but I've never really seen them, you know? Yeah, you missed a lot when you were mooing. Thanks so much for showing me around. Oh, it was our pleasure. We're so much enjoying getting to know you. Well, is there anything else you want to know? Oh, uh, ok. Do you mind if I ask you some questions about the father? Oh, sure, yeah. Well, he was my high school boyfriend, captain of the football team, really cute. And he got a scholarship, went off to college. That's great. Yeah, it's almost definitely him. How is that now? Well, there is a chance it's another guy. I mean, I've only ever been with 2 guys but they sorta overlapped. So, what does the other guy do? Does he go to the college, too? No, he's in prison. Uh, was he falsely accused of sth? No. He killed his father with a shovel. But other than that he's a great guy. I'll bet his dad doesn't think so. - Are you awake? - Of course I'm awake. As so from now on I'm always awake. Alright, we don't know that it's him. I mean, it could be the football guy. Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel killer. Alright, alright, let's say it is him. Would we not want baby? No. Would we treat him any differently? I'll keep an eye on him. - We have to find out which one the father is. - How? I don't know, there're tests for these things, right? Yeah, but maybe we're just overreacting. Easy for you to say. He's a father killer. He probably loves his mommy. He's probably got a tattoo says ""Mom"" on the shovel wielding arm. ""We'll now count from 1 to 5: ....."" - ""Good job!"" - Thank you. Hey, Joey. Listen, I feel really badly about yesterday and I thought it about a lot know I was too inpatient. So let's try it again. Oh no, that's ok. I don't need your help. I work it out on myself and I gotta say I'm pretty good. Really? Can I hear some of them? Sure, sure. Ok. See? Alright, you're not, you're not... Again, you're not SPEAKING FRENCH! Oh, well I think I am, yeah. And I think I'm definitely gonna get the part. How could you possibly think that? For one thing, the guy on the tape said I was doing a good job! Hi, Rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee? Sure. You've been quiet all morning, is everything ok? - You sure you are alright. - Yep. Ookay. Uhm, well I'm gonna go grab some breakfast. - FYI... - There it is. In the future, when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex, just do it. Wait, wait, you're mad at me about last night? I was just trying to do the right thing. Really? Well it seems to me if you've done the right thing, I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied. - Well... - Oh, stop that! I can't believe this. What do you... I was just being a good guy. I treated you with respect and understanding. Ahh, that is so hot. Hey, I was looking out for you. Oh, really? Well Ross, you know what? I am a big girl, I don't need someone telling me what is best for me. I gotta say I have not had sex a lot times before, this is the worst ever. Oh really, really? Well, it wasn't very good for me, either. Oh, ok, you know, hey hey! You know what? To avoid this little thing in the future, let's just say you and me, never having sex again. What? That's right, sex is off the table! I'm never having sex with you again. Dr Green, are you feeling better? Hey, how was lunch? We had a good time. BTW, I want to ask you sth. It would really mean a lot to me. If the baby is a boy, would you name him after my father Jiminy Billy Bob? Oh, really? Noo. You were right, that was fun. I'm gonna go finish packing. So, is she gonna take the test? No, she doesn't have to. I found out who the father is. Oh, God, it's Shovelly Joe, isn't it? No, it's not. How do you know? Well, it turns out that Erica didn't pay much attention in sex ed class. Because the thing she did with the prison guy would be pretty hard to make a baby that way. Oh, God. What was it? The thing we hardly ever do or the thing we never do? The thing we never do. Shovelly Joe. - Whenever you're ready, Joey. - Right. I'm sorry, what's going on? Dude, come on. French it up. Joey, do you speak French? You know what, I think this audition is over. Uh, excuse me? Uh, I am Ugeon Phillogne. I was passing by when I heard this man speaking the regional dialect of my French town of Estelloude. You really think this man is speaking French. Good job, little buddy. That was some really good French. But I think we're gonna go with someone else for the part. Oh, alright. But my French was good? It was great. Merci. - Emmas's down for the night. - Oh, good. So, I guess I'm gonna takeoff. Hey, listen, just before you go, I... Again I just wanna say 'thank you' for coming with me. Oh, no problem. And also, you know I... I was thinking about what you said, uh, you know, about the whole sex thing and... Probably not a great idea to go down that road again. Thank you. I'm glad you agree. It's shame though, I mean, when we did it, it was pretty good. Yeah, yeah, that's true. Hey, do you remember that one really great time? Oh, yeah. - You know, it was your birthday... - It was Valentine's day... - Oh, yeah. - Oh, yeah. Well, I guess that's all the past now. Uh-huh. - Not even one more time. - Not even once. - No matter how much we want it. - Even if we want it REALLY bad. That's what WE decided. Right. - It's kinda hard, though. - Yeah. You know? When two people have a connection, you know, that's... just seems like... such a waste. I hate waste. - Ross... - Yes. Just so you know, with us, it's never off the table. Dammit, it's never off the table. Ok, can you really tap dance? No. Off the resume. - Archery? - No. - Horseback riding? - Would fall off a lot. You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds? That I can do. Come on, you can drink a GALLON of milk in 10 seconds? Alright, watch me! Ok, your time, are you ready? Ready, go! You did it! <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"
1015,"Previously on Friends... How did the job stuff go? He offered me one. You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest. The job is in Paris. Oh, God! Please, somebody say something. So if you take this job you'll be moving to Paris? Or facing a bitch of a commute. I know, it's huge and it's scary, and it's... really far, far away from you guys but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. And I've already talked to them about our situation with Emma and they said they'll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable. - Okay. - I mean, I'll fly back and forth - they'll fly you out... Anything we want. - My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle. All right, we'll work it out. Thank you! Thank you! Yeah, yeah! You sure this is what you want? I think it is. Ooh, what's going on? I got a really incredible job offer. Hey, great! All right! Good for you! It's in Paris. What? No, no, no! No, no... no... no, no... No, too much is changing, okay? First, Phoebe getting married Congratulations! nd then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid suburbs... Hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive... Well, it comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it. Look, you guys... this is really, really important to me. And it means a lot if you could try to get on board. Of course we can. Congratulations. Yay! - Joey... - No, no, no. My hugs are reserved for people STAYING IN AMERICA. Joey, it would mean so... Hey! No! Get your France-going-arms away from me. Joey... You okay with this? Well, it makes me feel sad, but... Talking to Ross. I see. Well, Rachel moving to another country? Not being able to see her every day. How can I be okay with this? I know, but what are we gonna do? She really needs this job. Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back, she would take it? How is that gonna happen? Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes? I don't know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas party. We really hit it off. You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron? I didn't say we were brothers. Friends - 10x15 - Estelle Dies ľ@meitina ֹ-Meitina Adjusted by Madhero Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't. We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us and we're easily confused. We're not very bright. But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look? What do you think Pheebs? Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin Robbins... Anyway... Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard? Yeah. She died. You're kidding! That's terrible! Yeah, last Saturday. Wow! She was the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic. Oh, wait a minute, I read the wrong one. Oh yeah? Yeah, she was just an agent. Joey's gonna be so upset. I know. He always wanted to be the first black man to cross the Atlantic. Well, we cannot tell Joey about this. He's already flipping out about everything that's changing. This will push him over the edge. Seriously, you don't think we should tell him? Well, not for a little while. Let's just give him a few days to get used to everything else. What if he reads it in the paper? Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay. May I help you? Yeah, I'm a friend of Rachel Green's. Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas party about two years ago. Oh right, uhm, Don? Close. Ron. Uh... What can I do for you? Uhm, well... I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back. Ah, did she ask you to come here and do this? Oh, no. Then we'll see if she wants to come back. At first I have to get you to agree. Wow, that is tempting. Look, she loved her job here. And let's face it you're not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it. Isn't that true? She is good! Huh, I took a shot there. But I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do... Ah, it's not true, there is... nothing I want to do. I see... Thanks very much. Is this your son? Yeah, his name is Ross. What? Oh, nothing, it's just, it's close to Ron. Does he.. Does little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance? Yeah, they're all he talks about, why? How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after everyone else has left just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants. I just heard it as you must have heard it and that's not good. Let me start again. I'm a paleontologist you'll be there with us and the touching refers only to bones - fossils! You can really arrange that? You let Rachel come back, and it's done. Well, I guess having Rachel back wouldn't be the worst thing in the world. Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear, your kid is going to have the time of his life. That's great. I worry about little Ross. He's always reading, he's collecting rocks and he's obsessed with dinosaurs. He'll be fine. Hey Phoebe. Hey. Everything ok? I'm just mad at my agent. Estelle? Why? There's a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I didn't even be put up for it! She'd better have a good reason. I'm guessing she does. Well I'm wanna hear it, because she keeps doing this. Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. All right, I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me, that you will wait a minute before you call her. Ok. Why? Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason. I love that saying! Hello? Joey, it's Estelle. I was just gonna call you! That's weird. It's a little coincidental, but believable. Listen, I'm sure you're wondering why I didn't get you an audition for that TV movie. Yeah, actually I am! I guess I dropped the ball there. Whoopsie! That's it? You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball. Don't take that tone with me. Who you think you are? Alan Lemond, the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic? No, no, look. All I'm saying is that you're my agent, ok? And you're not getting me into any auditions and I'm tired of it. What are you saying? I'm saying that This isn't working for me anymore, ok? Estelle, you're fired. Goodbye. Man, tough week for Estelle! Hi. Hi. Emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house. You know she can't sleep without it. Oh, well, she's asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her. Ok. Oh, you're not gonna believe what happened to me today! Ralph Lauren called, and gave me my job back! Nooo! Yee. I mean, it was so weirdest thing. They fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back! I mean, that place must have been falling apart without me. So, you're not going to Paris. No, I'm still going. Wh - wh - what? When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back - they offered me more money! Isn't that great? - Yeeeah! Hi. We're buying the house next door and we were wondering if we could just take a look around. Oh, sure. I'm showing it to someone else right now but please, look around. Thanks. It feels like we're cheating on our house. And if we're gonna cheat, shouldn't it be with like a hot younger house, that does stuff that our house won't do? Ours is so much better! This living room is smaller, the dining room looks like a cave! What a hole! So? What do you think? Love it! Well, we already have one offer on it and I think the lady upstairs is goning to make another one. They could be our neighbors, what are they like? Oh, the woman upstairs is very nice. She and her husband have two kids, he's on Wall Street and she - Oh my God! Sure. Hey Joey, want come with me to - are you ok? Yeah, I just - I just feel bad about firing Estelle. This is got to be killing her. No, that wouldn't kill her. Ordinary embolism might. I don't know. She's got to be taking it hard, I was like her only client. Except for this guy who eats paper. And I'm guessing he eats more money than he makes. Look, I know she's not a great agent, but she did stick with me for ten years. I'm gonna call her and hire her again. No, no, no! Don't call her! You wait for her to call you - Why? - Because patience is the road to understanding which ... is the key... to a happy heart. You blow me away. All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you? I promise. And that means, never having to give a reason. What a small world! And yet I never run into Beyonc! You two know each other? Oh, we go way back. Before Monica made an honest man out of him Chandler used to be my little love muffin!heh-heh-heh!. So? Are you guys thinking of getting this house too? Ooh! Are we gonna have a bidding war? I'd better warn you, I'm a toughie Don't, don't! No, actually, we're buying the house next door. Why!? I don't know why. Ooh, that decides it then. I was on the fence. But knowing that you two would be our neighbors? Ah! now we have to get it! Ellen, we're going to talk numbers. This can not be happening! Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer. Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will. The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the Hitlers. Okay, Okay All right. What if we got both houses? Huh? We can turn this house into a guest house. That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful but when did you start crapping money!? Okay, you come up with an idea. Alright alright we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house We can still get out. But we love our house. Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder out here too. Just the crickets and ""Oh My God""! Okay, but if we don't get this house she's still gonna show up wherever we go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of surprise. I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words .. ...that make your balls jump back up inside your body. Well, we have to do something. We can't have her living next door. Oh, that does it too. Who is it? It's me. Ron. Look, I um, I now Rachel turned you down but I think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back. This may surprise you but re-hiring fired employees, is not my main job. Just hear me out. How would you feel about offering her a raise? Not good, Ron. Perhaps I can persuade you. What if you can give your son this genuine pterodactyl egg replica. Wow, that's pretty cool Huh? So? We have a deal? Okay, you got it. Yes! yes! This is gonna make me very popular. Oh, Believe me, the ladies, they love it! I meant with my son. Good, 'cause the ladies, not so much. Joey, this is Al T. Booker,the guy who eats paper. I'm sure you've heard that Estelle passed away. I wanted to let you know there's a memorial for her ... ...at the Westside chapel, tomorrow at ten. Hope you can make it. Oh my God. Hello? Joey, it's Estelle. Estelle? Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for firing me. Ok-ay. I just, I can't believe you're calling me? Well, I didn't think I should just drop by... No, no, no! Don't drop by, don't drop by! Anyway, you did what you had to do. I'm okay. Can I ask you something? Uhm, what's it like there? It's alright. Look kiddo, I gotta go. Good luck with the career. You're gonna be huge. Thanks for everything Estelle. Bye. ""out of area"". Boy, I'll say. Well... I just talked to Sid we are definitely putting in an offer on the house... a-a-and I'll bet we get it. The Hitlers will be so disappointed. All right, I got to run. Tell Monica I say goodbye. And... I'll see you later, neighbor. Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you're going to be here. Oh, me too... Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off. Huh? I never stopped loving you. Oh... my... Yeah, yeah, yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein. Chandler, what are you talking about? Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid and Monica never have to know a thing. I don't know what to say... I mean, you know, obviously we have this... heat between us. Obviously. But I love my husband. And I know you love your wife. Now, I don't think we should get this house now. Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away. Chandler, one of us has got to be strong. I understand. Although, maybe just... one last moment of weakness... Goodbye Chandler Bing. They're never coming down now. Hi! Hey! You are never going to believe what happened to me today. What? Ralph Lauren called again and they offered me more money. They did? Yeah. It was the weirdest thing. Zelner called me and he said we'll do everything we can to get you back. And that I should thank some Ron... I don't even know what department that guy's in. So, what are you gonna do? Well, I took it. That's great! So you're staying in New York! YAY! WHOO! YAY! You're excited, right? Ye-ah. Yeah! You know, the money's great. It's certainly the easier choice... Right! Yeah, you know, was I looking forward to going to Paris? Sure. You know, was I excited about working in the fashion capital of the world? Ooh, absolutely... Oh...! Yeah, but you know, this is... it's fine. I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much gotten everything out of that I possibly can... Uhm, I hadn't no you... I had no idea you were so excited about Paris. Uhm, I mean, you said you were scared. Well yeah, but I mean, it was good scared though, you know? Like when I-moved-to-New-York scared. Or uhm, when I-found-out-I-was-gonna-have-Emma scared... But this is... fine. This is gonna be good. You should go. What? It's what you want. You should go. You really think so? I really do. But I already told Zelner that I would come back... I'm sure he'll understand. All right. ALL RIGHT! I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna go to Paris. Yeah... Yeah! I'm going to Paris. Thank you, Ross! Yeah, yeah, oh! Oh! Oh, I'm so happy. Then I'm happy too. Thank you all for coming. We're here today to pay respects to a wonderful agent and a beautiful woman... ..inside. As Estelle's only two clients we would like to say a few words. Dude, where's my speech? That is entertaining. Al Zebooker everybody. <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"
1016,"Alright, let's play one more time, okay? And remember, if I win you do not move to Paris. Okay. Can't beIieve I'm risking this again, but you're on! Alright Joe, you remember the rules. Heads I win, tales you lose. Just flip! Dark tails! Damn it! Hey, so we thought we'd throw you a little going away party around 7. Oh, that sounds good! Hey Rach, you're leaving tomorrow. Shouldn't you be packing? It's all done! Oh yeah, right. And after I took a shower this morning I just threw my towel on the floor! Oh, God! It hurts to even joke about it. I know... honey, seriously I did it all. The luggage that I'm taking is in the bedroom. This is Emma's Paris stuff, ... these are boxes that I'm having shipped, ... and that's the sandwich I made for the plane... Okay, so you've done some good work. What about your carry-ons? Oh well, everything that I need is in here, and my travel documents are on the counter ... organized in the order that I will be needing them. Oh my God! I have nothing left to teach you! Where's your passport? It should be right next to my plane ticket. - Well, it's not. - What? Maybe I put it in here... Oh, oh, it's not in there! Oh no... I must have packed it in one of these boxes! Here, let me help you. Shoot... Oh, I can't believe I did this! At what point did it stop being funny that I took her passport? Friends - Season 10, Episode 16 The One With Rachel's Going Away Party Powered by Alcor dihero_liu@hotmail.com http://830824.blogone.net Special Thanks to: www.friends6.com & sogo & Mulder & i_love_rachel Adjusted by Madhero Oh, wow, can you believe you're really 3 weeks away? I know. You don't mind me touching your belly, do you? No, I don't mind you touching my belly, ... but right now your hand's kinda blocking the part where baby's gonna come out. - Hey! - Hi. - Hey Erica, welcome back to town! Wow, look how big you've gotten. That's because I 'm pregnant! Right, no, I... I understand. Oh, okay! I'm just always afraid that people think I'm just fat with big breasts. No, no, I knew. Okay, well, stop staring at them! She brought them up! I didn't realize you were coming back so soon! Hey, well, in a couple of weeks I won't be able to travel. Yeah, and I wanted her to get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel. Hotel? Why isn't she staying with you guys? Because we're moving in a couple of days and it just didn't make sense. Plus hotels are fun! My room has this little fridge full of free snacks. Erica, those things aren't free. In fact they have one of the highest markups in any consumer product... Ross! She's giving us her baby. She can eat you if she wants. I'll be right back. - Oh man, I can't believe you guys are leaving this place. - Oh, I know, I know. Hey, you know you can take it if you want! The lease is still in Nana's name! No no. This will always be your place. It would be too sad. Plus, how much a month does it cost to feed Joey? Yeah, it takes 2 incomes. Hey, is Chandler here? We talked about catching a movie. Oh, no. He doesn't have time for that. But if you want you can go help him and Joey pack up the guest room. Mhm, packing - sexy cheerleader comedy. Mhm, helpful brother - creepy loner at teen movie. What are you guys doing? Try it, I can't feel a thing! Are, are you kidding? This is packing? - We are taking a break! - From...? Jumping on the bed? Alright, Rachel's party is in a couple of hours and there's a lot to do! Now, Ross, you got Geller blood, you are in charge of these yahoos! - You got it! - Alright. Alright, she's right. We gotta get serious. Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him! No, no, no, guys. She's right. We should get to work. I'll take stuff out of the closet, ... Joey, you pack 'em, and Ross you re-pack whatever Joey packs. You guys hear a ringing? - What the hell is this? - Hey! Handcuffs! And fur line, nice! I didn't know you guys had it in ya! Chandler, you don't have a sister so you can't understand how much this bums me out. I didn't know Monica had these! Mhm, maybe she used 'em with another boyfriend. Maybe Richard! Why would she use them with Richard and not me? I can be kinky! I once did a naked danced for her... with scarves! Bumming hard, guys, bumming hard. - Hey! - Hey! Where is Mike? Oh, he has a gig. I kinda like being married to a rock star, you know. My husband has a gig. Yeah? Where... where is it? Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party. Rock on! Wow, this is quite a spread! What is all this stuff? Well, I thought this would be a great opportunity to use up all the food ... ...that I don't want to move to the new house with me! So, enjoy: ... smoked oyster casserole with a breakfast cereal crust, ... kidney beans in their own juices, and for dessert, a questionable orange. - Hey. - Hey. - Hey, where's Rach? Oh, she's putting Emma down, she'll be over in a second. Now it just  hit her that she's leaving and she's kind of emotional ... so no one say anything to set her off, okay?/Yeah. - Hey, Rach, hey you. - Here she is! HIi you guys! What did I just say? No, no, no, it's okay, it's okay. I'm gonna be fine. Come here, I'll make you a drink. Oh, man! I can't believe she's actually leaving. How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel? I know, she's been such a big part of my life, and it feels like when ""Melrose Place"" got cancelled. I mean...Oh, forget about it. I miss ""Melrose Place""! - You know, I had a chance to stop her too! - Yeah? Who loses 57 coin tosses in a row? You know, heads she wins, tails I lose! Wait a minute... Yes, Joe? I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning. You doing okay? - Well, I've been better. - Uh-hmm. You guys are gonna come and visit me, right? Yes! You know, in 6 months the Statue of Limitations runs out ... and I can travel internationally again! - I'm gonna miss you so much! - I know. You know what? Uhm, I have some goodbye stuff that I wanted to say to each of you ... and I was gonna save it until the end of the night, but come here. Come here. Hey, what do you think they're doing in there? Huh, if I had to guess I'd say Rachel's putting on the bubble wrap and Phoebe's doing the punching. Oh, Pheebs, I don't even know where to start. Okay well, before you do, I know we weren't supposed to get your ""going away"" presents, but I do have something for you. Oh, oh. What is it? Well, it's cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it, ... so that if they perfect the cloning process while you're over there, you can use the DNA to create your own Pheebs! I... I'm gonna throw this away, ... but thank you so much for the gesture! Chandler? I was just in our bedroom and I found these on my pillow. Oh, yes. I decided to leave these out for you ... in case Richard stops by and you wanna engage a little light bondage and mustache play! What are you talking about? These aren't mine. Oh yeah, right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from me! That would be a terrible punishment. - But I'm serious, I've never seen these before. - Really? Then what are they doing in our guest room? Rachel used to live in that room. Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting! Joey's bare ass! Well Played. - I love you Phoebe. - I love you too. Please, please don't... don't turn into... you know, French bitch! - Alright. Well, if I gonna do this, I'd better keep going. - Okay. - Okay. Monica? - Yeah? - Can you come here with me for a minute? - Sure. - Are you wearing waterproof mascara? - No. No, you're so screwed. Hey, what's that all about? She's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually. Are you kidding? Oh my God... Yeah, I know, it's gonna be even worse for you... God... Ross, get ready to do some serious crying. Oh, man, I'm not gonna be able to handle this. Now I know how my students feel at the end of each year. And why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations. Mon... Okay... I've gotta... just say what it is I'm gonna say... None of the amazing things that happened to me in the last ten years,would've happened if it wasn't for you. No one's been more like a sister to me. I know what you mean. You are like a sister to me too. I wouldn't know what I'm gonna do without you... - You're the best friend I ever had. - (Says something that cannot be understood) What? I... I... I... (again says something that cannot be understood) That is so sweet! Oh no, she took down Monica... And I'm the cryer in the family. Oh God! I could be next. - Maybe she won't talk to me if it looks like we're deep in conversation. - Okay. Oh, so that thing you said about the thing. It really made me think about that other thing. - Uh, Rach? - Yah? Well it's okay. Chandler's talking to her. I really made you think about that thing uh? Uh, Rach... I think I have something that belongs to you. Oh, I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get. No, no, no... They are really yours. We... found them in your old room. Well, these aren't mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with... Don't say Richard! Well, if they are not Monica's and not yours, ... then whose are they? Well, I think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room. Pheebs! Yeah! I think these are yours. These are not mine... Look how flimsy they are, come on! Good God! You try to hang a guy from a water pipe with these,they'll snap like a piece of licorice. - Can I taIk to you alone for a minute? - Sure. You don't really handcuff guys to water pipes, do you? Where do you think Mike really is? - Oh honey... - Let me just say something... Because once we get into this, I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just want to say that I...I love you. And, I'm gonna miss you. And I'm so sad that you're leaving. Oh, you know what? Let's not say anything else. I love you. Ooh, not so tight... - I'm sorry, just give me one more chance. - Okay. Oh... I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't, I can't. So, I guess you are next. You are ready? - I don't think so. - Oh, you're definitely not. I haven't cried like that in years. You cried yesterday at the 6 o'clock news. That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic. God! I can't believe she saved me for last. Why are they taking so long? - I dunno. But, God, Joey seems to be handling it surprisingly well. - No, no, no, no! Okay, here we go... Oh... Well... Yeah... I think I'm gonna to take off. - Huh? - Oh, you guys. This was an amazing night. Thank you so much.I love you. Good night. What? I don't get a goodbye?! Lucky bustard! Unbelievable! She says goodbye to everyone but me! Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit. Well, it needs to be plicit. Alright, let's think about this. I mean, there's got to be an explanation. Uh... did you do anything to make her mad? No, I don't think so. You know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk. It's pretty intense. - Yeah. Mine too. - Mine was a humdinger. Okay! I mean don't I deserve anything? I mean, a few tears, a cursory hug? NOT FROM YOU! Ross, if you're this upset, you should go and talk to her. And say what? ""You owe me a goodbye"", I mean, he's got more pride than that. THE HELL I DO! I don't get a goodbye? What? Everyone gets a goodbye but me? What have I got to do to get a goodbye, huh? Be best firiends with you? Uh, go out with you? H..have a baby with you? Oh wait a minute, wait a minute, I did all those things! Ross... Oh no, maybe it's me, I'm just not giving you enough credit. Uh, I mean it is difficult to say goodbye to 5 people. Uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good... (makes choking noises) It's physically impossible! You know what? After all we've been through, I can't believe this is how you want to leave things between us. Have a, have a good time in Paris. I hope Ross isn't too upset. - I'm sure he's not more bummed out than I am. - Tell me about it. Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party. Alright, I think I'm gonna head out. Uh, where do you think you're going? I thought I was going home to go to bed, but I'm sensing there's something less fun for me to do here? We are moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. It'd be great if you guys could pitch in. Joey and I can finish up in the guest room. Oh, yeah, yeah, good idea. Oh no! You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here. You couldn't be cool. Okay, We're gonna start in the kitchen. Plates get put into plate protectors and stacked ten to a box. The silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped. - Got it? - Yeah. Good. Now I need you to be careful and efficient. And remember, if I'm harsh with you, it is only because you're doing it wrong. Hey Mon, I think I've figured out whose handcuffs they are. You did? How? Well, I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them... being used. Oh my God! Let me see. Who's that dirty old lady? Monica's grandmother. Nana liked it rough! Hi. - Hey! - Come on here, have a seat. How was your night? Oh, it was okay. I went to a movie with my cousin and then out for dinner. We went to this place that had... Ooh...Hoo... ooh... Anyway, they had these really amazing cheeseburgers. Erica, are you okay? Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much. I keep getting these stomach aches. They come and go like every few minutes. - Oh my God! - Relax! We'll just get her some antacids. She doesn't have a stomache ache. She's in labor! - Oh my God! - Yeah, you got to get to the hospital. Okay! Chandler, get the coats. Erica let's go. Phoebe and Joey, keep packing! Oh my God we're gonna have a baby. Alright. We're gonna have a baby! Oh God, oh God, I got to sit down, I got to sit down. - Honey, it's gonna be okay. - You can do this. Just breathe. Okay, okay... Okay, I feel a little better. - Ooh! Are you sure? - Oh... Yes, I'm sure. - Oh honey, let's go. - Okay bye everyone. - Chandler, wait, wait, wait... - What? If you get a second, find out where she got that cheeseburger. You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care? That's what it seemed like. I cannot believe that after 10 years, you do not know ONE thing about me. Fine, then why didn't you say something? Because it is too damn hard, Ross! I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you everyday, it makes me not want to go... Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, ... you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me. So there, alright, there's your goodbye... Oh! - Rach! - What? - You keep, you keep... You can't... - What? - A little more. - Okay. A little more, a little more. Alright. Okay, let's do this. - Alright, ready? - Yeah. Alright, now give me your best shot. Alright, here it goes... Doesn't work... <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"
1017,"Monica's gonna freak if every box isn't labeled. You're right, okay... <i>box.. of...</i> <i>crap...</i> When Monica and Chandler come back here, they're gonna have a baby ! - a baby ! - I know ! Ross doesn't know the baby is coming. Should we call and tell him? Rachel still over there yelling at him. Poor guy, I would not wanna be him right now... - Wait. Should we be doing this ? - I don't know. - It's quite not really a good idea. - Probably not. - I've never stopped this before. - No, sir. The Last One I cant believe in a couple of hours we're gonna be parents. I can't believe it's three weeks early. I love that our baby is prompt! What room did the nurse say Erica was in? 702. Come on, Michelle. Get this thing out of me! Well, These are for you! Did you see the size of the thing that was coming out of that woman? I couldn't tell who is giving birth to who! - How is it going ? - It's Ok. The doctor says it'll still be a while. - How do you feel? - Well, It hurts sometimes. Not too bad at yet, though. It's a little scary. I know, but you're gonna be fine. Tell that to the lady in 702 With the toddler coming out of her. I think that kid was wearing a shirt! You're gonna be fine, though. - Go back to sleep. I have to go home. - Oh, God. This was amazing. - It really was. You've learned some new moves! - Yeah, well, this guy at work gave me ""Sex for Dummies"" as a joke. - Who's laughing now? - I know! - Breathe, breathe, breathe... - Good... - Next time, can I say breathe? - No, last time you said it like Dracula,and it scared her! Can I get you anything? You want some more ice chips? - No, I'm okay. - Alright, I'll be right back. - Where are you going? - To use the bathroom. - You can't leave me alone with her. - What? - This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with! - What kind of social situation are you comfortable with? - It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together. - You'll be fine. Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two minutes. - So,... Any plans for the summer? - I don't know. Maybe church-camp? - Hah. May not wanna mention this. So, you ever wonder which is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts? - What? - Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both. - One of life's great, unanswerable questions. I mean, who knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things? Like this.. - Come in. - Morning. What's that? - It's my house-warming present for Monica and Chandler. - It's a baby chick and duck! - Uh-huh. And I named them Chick Jr. and Duck Jr. - I did not see that coming. - Yeah, I figure they'll love it at the new house you know? It has that big backyard. And then, when they get old, they can go to that special farm that Chandler took the other chick and duck to. Yes! - Yeah. It's a shame people can't visit there. - That is the rule, though. - Guess what? You're almost an uncle! What? - Yeah, Erica went into labor last night. Monica and Chandler are at the hospital right now! - Oh my God! - Yeah, and I have a definite feeling it's gonna be a girl. - Phoebe, you were sure Ben was gonna be a girl. - Have you seen him throw a ball? - Is Rachel here? - Uh, I think she's still asleep. Hey, how did it go with you guys last night? She seemed pretty pissed at you. we worked things out. - What's that smile? Did something happen with you two? -  Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell... but I'm also not one to have sex and shut up. We totally did it! - Oh my God. You and Rachel? - I know, it's pretty great. - So what does that mean? Are you guys getting back together? - Oh, I.. I don't know. We didn't really get to talk. - But do you wanna get back together? - I don't know. It was incredible. I mean, it just felt so right. When I was holding her, I mean... I never wanted to let her go. You know what? Yeah, I do. I wanna be together. Yay! <i>Yay!</i> - So, so is she still going to Paris? - Wow, I hadn't thought of that. I hope not. - Oh, this is like the best day ever. Ever! You guys might get back together, Monica and Chandler are getting their baby, there are chicks and ducks in the world again! Oh, I feel like I'm in a musical! <i>""Daa - raa... When the sun comes up, bright and beaming! And the moon comes...""</i> - Morning! - Guess we'll never know how it ends. - Hey. How did you sleep? - Good. You? - Good. - I bet you did! - Uh. Would you guys mind giving us a minute? - Sure, yeah. Will you just keep an eye on the chick and the duck? - Chick and the duck? Didn't they die... - Dive! Yeah, they dove head-first into fun on the farm. Morning. - You too. Last night was just wonderful. - It really was. - I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face. - I know, me too. You know, it was like one of those things you think is never gonna happen, and then it does, and it's everything you want it to be. - Uh-huh. I know. It was just, it was just the perfect way to say goodbye. - It's just a little bit more, honey. - Help me! This hurts! - Is it really that bad? I think it's time to kick you in the nuts and see which is worse! The baby's head is crowning. - Oh! Oh my God! That is the most beautiful top of a head I have ever seen! Chandler, you have to see this! - I'm okay. - Chandler, you don't wanna miss this... This is the birth of your child! It's the miracle of life! - Alright. Wow, that is one disgusting miracle. Start pushing. Here we go. Here come the shoulders... - It's a... It's a boy! - Is he okay? - He's just fine. - Oh, you did it! - It's a baby! A beautiful little baby!... And some other stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see. Would you like to cut the umbilical cord? - Well, that's spongy. - Oh, hey handsome! Oh, I'm gonna love you so much that... no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you! - Oh, we are so lucky! - I know. He has your eyes. - I mean, I know that's not possible, but he does. We'll just get him cleaned up a bit. - Oh my God, he's beautiful. Thank you so much. - I'm really happy for you guys. - How do you feel? - I'm tired! Well, you don't have that much time to relax. The other one will be along in a minute. I'm sorry, who should be along in a what now? The next baby should be along in a minute. - We only ordered one! - You know it's twins, right? - Oh, yeah! These are the faces of two people in the know! I can't believe you didn't know it's twins! This has never happened before. - Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good. Wait, did you know it was twins? Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in Ohio. - Anybody tell you? - I don't think so. Although, they did mention something about two heartbeats. But I thought that was just mine and the baby's. They kept saying both heartbeats are really strong... and I thought well, that's good 'cause I'm having a baby. - This is unbelievable. - Twins actually run in my family. - Interesting! Can I see you for a second? - What do we do? - What do you mean ""what do we do""? Twins!! Twins!! - Chandler, you're panicking! - Ah-ha... Join me, won't you?! Okay, what do you say we keep one, and then just like have an option on the other one? - We can't split them up! - Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion, and then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited I mean, that's a great day for everybody. - Okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible? - What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king? - Yeah, because I hear the king is looking to adopt. - Monica, we are not ready to have two babies! - That doesn't matter! We have waited so long for this. I don't care if it's two babies. I don't care if it's three babies! I don't care if the entire cast of ""Eight is Enough"" comes out of there! We are taking them home, because they are our children! It looks like we're about ready over here. Come on, Erica, start pushing again now. Here she comes! - She? It's a girl? - Yeah. - Well, now we have one of each! And that's enough! - And then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye. - Oh my God! - What did you say? - Nothing! What do you say to that? - Ross, you've got to tell her how you feel! - No way! - You can't just give up! Is that what a dinosaur would do? - What? - Dude, I'm just trying to speak your language. - Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you wanna get back together... ...If she did, she might feel differently. She might not even go. - You really think so? - I'm telling you! Oh, okay! This is the part of the musical where there'd be a really good convincing song. <i>Don't take no for an answer.</i> <i>- Don't let love fly away.</i> - Hi! - Can't a girl finish a song around here? - Hi! So I just dropped Emma off at my mom's. - Oh, you're not taking her with you tonight? - No, we decided that I would go ahead and set up first, and then my mom would bring Emma to Paris on Sunday. - Wow, eight hour flight with a one-year old? Good luck, mom. - Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mother talking about Atkins? Good luck, Emma! - Alright, you know what? You're right. I should at least tell her how I feel. - Ross, wait, wait! - What? What? - Could you get me a muffin? - Rachel ? - Yeah? I know you're leaving tonight, ...but I just have to tell you... ...I love you. I don't know if that changes your plans at all, but.. ...I thought you should know. Gunther... I love you too. Probably not in the same way,... ...but I do. And, and when I'm in a caf, having coffee, or I see a man with hair brighter than the sun, I'll think of you. - Oh... Bye guys. - Bye. - Oh my God! - Unbelievable! - Hey, you know what might help? - I'm not getting you a muffin! - Do you think they recognize each other from in there? - Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years, and then one day, they're pushed through a vagina and they meet. We're going to take Erica to recovery now. - There's something that we wanna tell you. We decided to name the girl-baby Erica. - Oh my God, that's just like my name! - Son of a gun, it is! - Anyway, I'm gonna go and get some rest. I'm really glad I picked you guys. You're gonna make great parents. Even Chandler. - Okay, well, bye! - Bye! - We'll call you! - Have fun at church-camp! - Oh, look at these little bunnies! - I know! You ready to trade? - We could trade later. - Yeah, I'm good. - Hey, what are you working on? - It's a ""welcome home"" sign for the baby. - How sweet! Oh, is that the baby? - No, I sat in the paint. - Hey. So, did you talk to Rachel? - No, and I'm not going to. - What? - Why not? - Because she's just going to shoot me down. You guys saw what happened with Gunther. That did not look like fun. - How can you compare yourself to Gunther? I mean, sure, he's sexy in a more obvious way. You have a relationship with her, - you slept together last night! - Yeah, and she still wants to go! It's pretty clear where she is. - Yeah, I know what you mean. I mean, sometimes... - Uh, Joe? - Damn it! - Look, even if I were gonna tell her, I don't have to do it now. Okay? I'll be seeing her again. We've got time. -  No, you don't! She's going to Paris! She is going to meet somebody. Do you know how many hot guys there are in Paris? It's... It's a city of Gunthers! - Hey! What do you have there? Oh, I made a little something. If I had more time to work on it, it'd be better, but.. - Oh my God! You did that yourself? - Honey, that's gorgeous!. - You know, the baby can't read, Mike! - Hi! You guys, the car-service just got here. I can't believe they're not home yet! I have to catch my stupid plane. I wanna see the baby! - Monica just called from the cab. She said they should be here any minute. And apparently, there's some big surprise. - Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's baby... was born with a teeny, tiny beard. Hey, so what is the big surprise? - Oh my God! - Okay, okay, awkward question : The hospital knows you took two, right? - Yes, it's twins! - Oh, they're so cute! Now, what, what kinds are they? This is a boy, and that's a girl. - Her name is Erica. - Hey, that pregnant girl's name was Erica! - Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time together. - Yeah, we named the boy Jack after dad. - Aw, he's gonna be so happy. - Oh, Jack Bing. I love that. it sounds like a '40s newspaper guy, you know? Jack Bing, Morning Gazette : ""I'm gonna blow this story wide open!"" Wow, so beautiful. I want one. - Oh yeah? Well, tell me which one, and I'll try slip it in my coat. Seriously. Wanna make one of those? - One? How about a whole bunch? - Really? - Yeah! - Ooh, we could teach them to sing, ....and we can be like the Von Trapp family! Only without the Nazis. Although that sounds kinda dull. - Oh, you guys, I can't believe this... ... But I'll leave now, or I'm gonna miss my plane. - I'm just so glad you got to see the babies. - Me too. Oh, I'm just sorry I'm not gonna be around to watch you two attempt to handle this! Alright, I can't say goodbye to you guys again... ... I love you all so much. - I love you. - Call us when you get there! -  I will. Ross, come here. - I just want you to know.. ... Last night.. ...I'll never forget it. - Neither will I. - Alright, now I really have to go. Ok. "" Au revoir ! "". they're gonna really hate me over there. - So, you just let her go? - Yeah. - Hey, maybe that's for the best. - Yeah? - Yeah. You know? You gotta think about last night the way she does, okay? Maybe... maybe sleeping together was.. the perfect way to say goodbye. They slept together? I was with you! - But now she'll never know how he feels! - Maybe that's okay. You know? ...Maybe, maybe it is better this way... I mean, now, now you can move on... ...I mean, you've been trying to for so long, maybe now that you're on different continents.. Right? - Maybe now you can actually do it. You know? You can... You can finally get over her. - Yeah, that's true. .. Except ...I don't wanna get over her. - What? - I don't! I wanna be with her. - Really? - Yeah, I'm gonna go after her. Wait, wait! Get your coat! - Get your coat! - My coat.... - This is so cool! - I have no idea what's going on, but I am excited! - But Ross, What do you, what do you think she's going to say? - I don't know - but I.. Look, even if she shoots me down, at least... I won't spend the rest of my life wondering what would have happened. - where is my coat?! - You didn't bring one! My cab's downstairs, I'll drive you to the airport. - Okay, guys, wish me luck. - Hurry! - Good luck, good luck! Oh my God. Ross is going after Rachel. And you guys have babys. This is like the best day ever. Why there's an ass-shaped paint stain on my couch? Just your question, Mike ! You really think we gonna make it in time? Hey, I haven't had my licence taken away 'cause I drive carefully? - There's no seatbelt! - That's okay. If we hit anything,... the engine will explode, so you know, it's better if you're thrown from the car. - Alright, alright, let's do this! - Ok. - 18th and East End. - I don't take passengers. - Hey! The law says you have to accept any fare. - No, you don't understand. This isn't a real cab. Alright, I gotta report you. What's your medallion number? My medallion number is : - Get out of the cab! - What? - Get out of the cab! - Get out of the cab! Hey, guys. Check this out! - No! - Ok. - Oh, hey, can I give you guys your house-warming present now? - Now, that you can do. I have a question. Without looking under the diapers, can you tell them apart? Ofcourse I can, I'm their mother! Ok, which one is that one? That's Jack. Jack's gonna have a tough time in high schoole with that vagina! Chick Jr.? Duck Jr.? Don't hide from mama! - You can open your eyes now. - Are we off the bridge? - Yes. - Is the old woman on the bicycle still alive? - Yes, she jumped right back up. - Oh my God, Phoebe, slow down! - Do you wanna get to Rachel in time? - Yes, but I don't wanna die in your cab! - You should have thought of that before you got in! Toll-booth. - What? - Toll-booth! Four bucks. There are quarters in the glove compartment. - Hurry! - Damn, that window is clean. - We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but now we understand you were doing this! - Okay, I wanted to surprise you, but for your house-warming gift, I got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck! - Really? You got us a chick and a duck? - Oh, great! Just what you want for a new house with infants. Bird feces. - Yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now they're gone! - Oh, don't worry, we'll find them. - Actually, I'm gonna go check on the twins. - Oh God! What did I just step on? - It's okay, it's just an egg roll. - You stepped on my egg roll? - I'm sorry, I didn't know to look for Chinese food on the floor! - Just put it on a plate and leave! - Okay, let's find these birds. - Okay. - Wait, wait. Do you hear that? - Oh! They're in the table! - Well, that can't be good! - We gotta get them out of there! - How? - Oh, oh! Maybe we can lure them out. You know any birdcalls? - Oh, tons, I'm quite the woodsman. - Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little. - Joey, wait! The ball! - Oh God! - So what do we do? - I don't know. - Maybe we can open this up somehow. - Okay. - No... It's all glued together. - Does that mean we have to bust it open? - I don't know. Maybe. - Oh my God! - I know! It's.. It's the foosball table. - All right, you know what? We don't have a choice. It's like I would have said in that sci-fi movie, if I'd gotten the part. <i>""Those are our men in there, we have to get them out!</i> <i>Even if I have to sacrifice the most important thing in my life...</i> <i>... my time-machine.""</i> - Did that movie ever get made? - It did not. - Ross, where are you going? - To talk to Rachel, isn't that why we took a ride in the death-cab? - What? are you just gonna walk up to her at the gate? Have you never chased anyone through the airport before? - Not since my cop-show got cancelled. - You have to get a ticket to get past security. - What? We're never gonna make it! - Not with that attitude! Now, haul ass! -  Okay, if you could all walk slower, that'd be great. Madame, your passport please? - Oh my God! I was so afraid I wasn't gonna remember any of my high-school French, but I understood every word you just said! Your boarding pass, please. - Oh, shoot. I had it. Oh, I can't believe this. - Madame, if you don't have your boarding pass... - I have it, I have it, I have it. okay, I can't find it, but I remember that I was in seat 32C, because that's my bra-size. - Madame, you must have your boarding pass.. - Okay, fine! But you know what? If I was in 36D, we would not be having this problem. - Hey, I need a ticket. - Just one? I drive you all the way down here, and I don't get to see how it works out? - Fine, two tickets, I need two tickets. - We're on our honeymoon. - And the destination? - I don't care. Whatever is the cheapest. - I'm so lucky I married you. - Oh! Shoot! Damn it! Where is it? Oh! Oh! I found it! I found it! - Hah! I found it! I told you I would find it! In your face!. You're a different person. - Okay, flight 421 to Paris. I don't see it, do you see it? - No, did we miss it? - No, That's impossible. It doesn't leave for another 20 minutes. - Maybe we have the flight-number wrong. God. - Hello. - Hey, it's me. Here's Ross. - What? Hey, hey, listen.. - Oh my God! Ross, you wouldn't believe the cute little noises the twins are making. - Listen. - Monica ! - Oh, I'm sorry. Shoot, they were doing it before. - That's alright. Listen, listen. - Oh, wait! Here they go again. - Isn't that cute? - That is precious! Listen! I need Rachel's flight information. It's flight 421. Leaves at 8:40. - Yes, that's what I have. It's not on the board. - That's what it says here. Flight 421, leaves at 8:40, Newark airport. - What? - Newark airport. Why, where are you? - JFK. Don't worry, you guys, we're gonna get you out of there! - And we're also gonna buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids. - Okay. Here goes! - What's the matter? - I need to say goodbye to the table first. - I understand. Table, you have given us so many great times. And you guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel... All of you guys, What can I say? You guys... ...make us... look good. - You wanna say anything? - I don't know. Except that, for one last time... Good game, good game, good game... good game. - Okay, here we go. I can't do it. - Well, I can't do it either. - Hey! Did you find them? - Yeah, they're stuck inside the table! -  We have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it! - Oh, well sure. This gotta be so hard. I'll do it. Gimme! - Phoebe! Wow! No, no, no! -  Well, I've never gone this fast before! -  Phoebe, forget it, okay? Newark is like an hour away. ...There's no way we're gonna make it in time. - She's got her cell, you could call her. - I am not doing this over the phone. - You don't have any other choice! - Hello? - Rachel? Oh, good. - Hey, by the way, did you just get on the plane? - Yeah. For what it's worth, we would have caught her if we were at the right airport. - Uh, Rach, hang on. - Phoebe? Is everything okay? - Uhm, actually no. No, you've... - You have to get off the plane. - What? Why? - I have this feeling that something's wrong with it. ... Something is wrong with the left phalange. - Oh, honey, I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the plane. - Alright, look, I have to go. I love you, and I will call you the minute I get to Paris.. Uhm, what was that? - Oh, that was just my crazy friend. She told me I should get off the plane, because she had a feeling that there was something wrong with the left phalange. Okay, that doesn't sound good. - I wouldn't worry about it., She's always coming up with stuff like this, and you know what? She's almost never right. - But she is sometimes? - Well... - Wait, what are you doing? - Well, I can't take this plane now. Excuse me, sir? - where are you going? - I have to get off this plane, okay? Her friend has a feeling.. ...something's wrong with the left phalange. - Could I get some peanuts? - What's wrong with the plane? - There's nothing wrong with the plane. - Yeah! The left phalange! - There is no phalange! - Oh my God. This plane doesn't even have a phalange! - I'm not flying on it! - Ma'am, please sit down! - What's going on? - We're all getting off. There is no phalange! - This is ridiculous! I... - Yeah, okay. - Alright. My job here is done. - That was... Impressive. - Yeah, you didn't even use the tools for most of it! - Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get back to the babies. I'll see you girls later. - Sorry about the table, man. - You gonna buy a new one? - Probably not. ...Nah. I don't know how much I'm gonna wanna play after you go. - Well, at least we got these little guys out. - Aww, we were worried about you! I guess I better get used to things crapping in my hand, huh? -  I'm gonna miss these little guys. It was nice having birds around again. - Hey, you know what? Maybe we should keep them here with you. - What? - Yeah, I mean we've got a lot going on right now. And, plus, here they'd have their own room. - I could get a goose! You know, I think you're set with the poultry. - Thanks man. Did you hear that, you guys? You're gonna get to stay here! And, and it's good, you know, 'cause, 'cause now you have a reason to come visit. - I think there may be another reason. So... awkward hug or... ...lame cool guy handshake? - Uh, lame cool guy handshake, yeah. - Ma'am, I assure you, the plane is fine. - And you fixed the phalange? - Yes, the phalange is fixed. As a matter of fact, we put a whole lot of extra phalanges onboard, just in case. - Where is she? - I don't see her. - There she is! - excuse me, sir, do you have a boarding pass? - No, no, I just have to talk to someone. - I'm sorry, you cannot go any further without a boarding pass. - No, no, no, but... - Oh my God... What.. What are you guys doing here? - Okay, you're on. - What? What? Ross, you're scaring me. What's going on? - Okay, the thing is.. - Don't go. - What? - Please, please stay with me. I am so in love with you. Please, don't go. - Oh my God. - I know, I know. I shouldn't have waited 'till now to say it, but I'm.. That was stupid, okay? I'm sorry, but I'm telling you now. I love you. Do not get on this plane. - Miss? Are you boarding the plane? - Hey, hey. I know you love me. ... I know you do. - Miss? - I have to get on the plane. - No, you don't. - Yes, I do. - No, you don't. - They're waiting for me, Ross. I can't do this right now, I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - I'm so sorry. - I really thought she'd stay. - I'm sorry. - Well, that's it. Everything's packed. - Wow, this is weird. - I know. - Yeah. - Uh, does this mean there's nothing to eat? - I put three lasagnas in your freezer. - I love you! - So did you guys make it in time? - Yeah, yeah, he talked to her, but she got on the plane anyway. - Where's Ross? - He went home, He didn't want to see anybody. <i>- Ross, hi.</i> <i>It's me. ...</i> <i>..I just got back on the plane.</i> <i>And I just feel awful...</i> <i>...That is so not how I wanted things to end with us...</i> <i>...It's just that I wasn't expecting to see you</i> <i>and all of a sudden you're there and saying these things...

'Cause this is where I wanna be, okay? No more messing around. I don't wanna mess this up again. we're done being stupid. - Okay. You and me, alright? This is it. - This is it. Unless we're on a break. - Don't make jokes now. - Okay, please be careful with that. It was my grandmother's. Be careful. - If that falls off the truck, it wouldn't be the worst thing. - I know... ...It seems smaller somehow. - Has it always been purple? - Look around, you guys... this was your first home. ...And it was a happy place... ....filled with love and laughter... .. But more important.. .. because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal! - Hey, do you realise that at one time or another we all lived in this apartment? - Oh yeah ! - That's true. - Uh, I haven't. - Wait a minute. What about that summer during college that you lived with grandma, And you tried to make it as a dancer? - Do you realise we almost made it ten years without that coming up? - Oh, honey, I forgot. I promised Treeger that we'd leave our keys. I guess this is it. Yeah. - Yeah. I guess so. - This is harder than I thought it would be. - Oh, it's gonna be okay. - Do you guys have to go to the new house right away, or do you have some time? - We got some time. - Okay, should we get some coffee? - Sure. Where? <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"
102,"You don't understand. For us, kissing is as important as any part. Yeah, right! You serious? Oh, yeah. - Everything is in that first kiss. - Absolutely. For us, kissing's an opening act.. like the comedian you have to sit through.. before Pink Floyd comes out. And it's not that we don't like the comedian. It's just that that's not why we bought the ticket. The problem is, no matter how great the show was.. you girls are looking for the comedian again. We're in the car, fighting traffic, just trying to stay awake. Word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Or next time you'll find yourself listening to that album alone. Are we still talking about sex? The One With the Sonogram at the End No, it's good. It is good. It's just that Doesn't she seem a little angry? Well, she has issues. Does she? Try to live with ""Mr. I'm Evolving."" He's out while she's home getting the mastodon smell out of the carpet. Marsha, see, these are cave people. Okay, they have issues like: ""Gee, that glacier's getting kind of close."" Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? - No. - Yes, it is. Carol, hi! Okay. Yes, it is. I'll catch up with you in the Ice Age. - Can I stay? - No. - Hi. - Hi. - Is this a bad time? - No, it's.. the Stone Age. You look great. I hate that. Sorry. Thanks. You look good too. Well, you know, in here, anyone who.. stands erect.. - What's new? Still a - A lesbian? You never know. How's the family? - Marty's still totally paranoid. - Carol, why are you here? - I'm pregnant. - Pregnant. She didn't leave in such a hurry after all. This is the Three's Company episode with a misunderstanding. Then I've already seen this one. Are you through with that? Sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. Whose ball of paper is this? Mine. I wrote a note to myself, then I didn't need it. So I balled it up and now I wish I was dead. She already fluffed that pillow. You already fluffed It's fine. I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition. Parents can be cruel about the flatness of a child's pillow. Relax, you do this every time. The place looks great. You got a lasagna here that looks good enough.. to avoid touching. Monica? Hi! Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're all chaotic and twirly, you know? Not in a good way. Calm down. You don't see Ross getting twirly every time they come. That's because my parents think Ross can do no wrong. You see, he's ""The Prince."" They had some big ceremony before I was born. - What? - Ugly Naked Guy got a ThighMaster. - Has anybody seen my engagement ring? - It's beautiful. Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God! No, don't touch that. Like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back. ""Hi, Barry, remember me? I'm the girl that stomped on your heart."" Now I must return the ring without the ring.. which makes it so much harder. Easy, we'll find it. Won't we? Look, it's gonna be okay. You'll give it back.. - and we'll eat ice cream. - Okay. It's a pear-shaped diamond Any diamond ring we find, we'll run it by you. - When did you have it last? - Doy, right before she lost it. You don't get a lot of ""doy"" these days. I know I had it this morning. I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with Dinah? - Oh, don't be mad. - You didn't. - Oh, I'm sorry. - I gave you one job! But look how straight those noodles are. That's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagna. I just can't do it. Boys? We're going in. Hi. - That is not a happy ""hi."" - Carol's pregnant. I found it! What? Yeah. Do that for two hours, you might be where I am about now. That puts that whole pillow thing in perspective. How do you fit into this whole thing? Carol and Susan want me to be involved. But if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved. - It's totally up to me. - She is so great. I miss her. - What does she mean by ""involved""? - Your job is done. And the most enjoyable. Phoebe, say something. They want me to go down to this sonogram thing.. with them tomorrow. Remember when life was simpler.. and she was just a lesbian? Those were the days. - What are you gonna do? - I have no idea. No matter what I do, I'm still gonna be a father. This is still ruined, right? Martha Lugwin's daughter is gonna call you. - What's that curry taste? - Curry. I think they're great. I really do. The big Lugwin had a thing for you. - They all had a thing for him. - Oh, Mom. Why is this girl going to call me? She just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking or food.. I told her you have a restaurant - I don't have, I work in a restaurant. - They don't have to know that. - Ross, help me with the spaghetti. - Yes. Oh, we're having spaghetti. That's easy. We were going to have lasagna. - I love lasagna. - We're not having it. Then why bring it up? He latches on. This will sound unbelievably selfish.. but did you plan to bring up the baby/lesbian thing? It might take the heat off of me. That Rachel. We saw her parents at the club. They were not playing well. I won't say what they spent.. but $40,000 is a lot for a wedding. At least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar. - What's that supposed to mean? - Nothing. - It's an expression. - No, it's not. Don't listen to her. You've always been independent. Even when you were a chubby kid.. and you had no friends, you were just fine. You'd read alone in your room. Your puzzles.. People like Ross need to shoot for the stars. With his museum and his published papers. Others are satisfied with staying where they are. These people never get cancer. They're happy with what they have, content.. like cows. Cows, Dad? She knows how much I love cows. I read about women trying to have it all, and I thank God.. our ""Harmonica"" doesn't have that problem. - I'm telling you, you'll be fine. - Thank you, Daddy. Oh, so this does work. So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? Look, I realize you guys have been wondering.. what exactly happened between Carol and me. And so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She lives with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child. She and Susan are going to raise the baby. And you knew about this? Folks are really that bad? Well, you know, these people are pros. They know what they do. They take their time. They get the job done. They say that you can't change your parents. Boy, if you could, I'd want yours. Must pee. It's worse when you're twins. - You're a twin? - We don't speak. She's this high-powered, driven, career-type. - What does she do? - She's a waitress. - Identical? - People say we look alike. But I don't see it. You guys, I kind of gotta clean up now. Chandler, as an only child, you don't have this. No, although I did have an imaginary friend.. who my parents preferred. Hit the lights, please. How long was I in there? - I'm just cleaning up. - Oh, you need any help? Okay, sure. Thanks. Anyway.. So you nervous about Barry tomorrow? A little. A lot. So, got any advice? You know, as someone who's recently been dumped. You may wanna steer clear of the word ""dumped."" Chances are he's gonna be this broken shell of a man. You should try not to look too terrific. I know it'll be hard. Or I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring. And you can go with Carol and Susan to the ob-gyn. You've got Carol tomorrow. - When did it get so complicated? - Got me. - Remember being in high school? - Yeah. Didn't you think you'd meet someone.. fall in love, and that'd be it? - Ross? - Yes. Yes. Man, I never thought I'd be here. Me neither. Sorry I'm late. I got stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur thing. Anyway.. Hi. - You remember Susan. - How could I forget? Hello, Susan. Good shake, good shake. So, we're just waiting for? - Dr. Oberman. - And is he? - She. - Of course, ""she."" Is she familiar with our special situation? - Yes, and she's very supportive. - Okay, that's great. No, I'm Oh. Thanks. That opens my cervix. - Barry? - Come on in. - Are you sure? - It's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours. So, how are you doing? I'm.. I'm okay. - You look great. - Yeah, well. Dr. Farber, Jason Greenspan's gagging. Be right there. Be back in a second. I dumped him. So, how's this all gonna work? The baby grows in a special place inside Thank you. I mean, how's this gonna work, you know, with us? When important decisions have to be made? - Give me a ""for instance."" - Well, I don't know. - How about with the baby's name? - Marlon. If it's a boy. Minnie, if it's a girl. As in ""Mouse""? As in my grandmother. Still, you say ""Minnie,"" you hear ""Mouse."" How about..? How about Julia? - Julia. - We agreed on Minnie. We agreed we'd spend our lives together. Things change. Roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table? Sorry about that. So, what have you been up to? Oh, not much. - I got a job. - That's great. Why are you so tan? I went to Aruba. Oh, no. You went on our honeymoon alone? No. I went with.. - Now, this may hurt. - Me? No. I went with Mindy. Mindy? My maid of honor, Mindy? Yeah, we're kind of a thing now. You got plugs! Careful. They haven't quite taken yet. And you got lenses. You hate sticking your finger in your eye. Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you. Okay. A month ago, I wanted to hurt you more than I've ever wanted to. And I'm an orthodontist. You know, you were right. I thought we were happy. We weren't happy. But with Mindy.. now I'm happy. - Spit. - What? Me. Anyway.. I guess this belongs to you. Or maybe some day Mindy. Like she'd settle for that. Yeah, that's true. But I think it's a nice ring.. and thank you for giving it to me. Thank you for giving it back. Hello! - Please, what's wrong with Helen? - Helen Geller? - I don't think so. - It's not gonna be Helen Geller. - Thank you. - No, I mean, it's not Geller. It'll be Helen Willick? No, actually, we talked about Helen Willick Bunch. Wait a minute. Why is she in the title? It's my baby too. Really? I don't remember you making any sperm. And we all know what a challenge that is. - You two, stop it. - She gets a credit. I'm in there too. Helen Willick Bunch Geller? I think that borders on child abuse. Of course not. I'm suggesting Geller Willick Bunch. See what he does? He knows no one's gonna say all those names. They'll call her Geller. He gets his way. My way? You think this is my way? Of all the ways I ever imagined this moment being.. this is not my You know what? This is too hard. Knock, knock. How are we? Any nausea? - A little. - Just a little. I was wondering about the mother-to-be, but thanks for sharing. - Lie back. - You know what? I'm gonna go. I don't think I can be involved in this family thing. - Oh, my God! - Look at that. I know. Well, isn't that amazing? What are we supposed to be seeing here? I don't know, but I think it's about to attack the Enterprise. If you tilt your head and relax your eyes.. it kind of looks like an old potato. Then don't do that, all right? Monica, what do you think? - Are you welling up? - No. - You are. You're welling up. - I'm not. - You're gonna be an aunt. - Oh, shut up. Hi, Mindy. Hi, it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I saw Barry today. Yeah, he told me. No, it's okay. Really, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy. I really do. And, Min, you know, if everything works out.. and you guys get married and have kids.. I hope they have his hairline and your nose! That was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now! <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"
103,"- Hi, guys. - Hey, Phoebe. - How did it go? - Not so good. He walked me home and said, ""Let's do this again."" He said, ""Let's do this again."" That's good, right? Translated, ""Let's do this again"" means, ""You'll never see me naked."" Since when? Since always. It's, like, dating language. Like, ""It's not you"" means, ""It is you."" ""You're nice"" means, ""I'll be dating alcoholics.. and complaining about them to you."" ""We should see other people"" means: ""Ha-ha, I already am!"" Everybody knows this? Cushions the blow. Like your parents putting the dog to sleep.. and saying it went to a farm. That's funny. Because our parents actually did.. send our dog off to live on a farm. Ross? Hello! The Milner's farm in Connecticut? The Milners had this unbelievable farm. They had horses and rabbits to chase. And it was.. Oh, my God! Chi-Chi! The One With the Thumb How does it feel knowing you're about to die? Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die. That was really good! Thanks. Let's keep going. So, what do you want from me, Dimon? Huh? I just wanna go back to my cell, because in my cell I can smoke. Smoke away! I think this is why Dimon smokes in his cell alone. - What? - Relax your hand. Let your wrist go. Not so much! All right. Now take a puff. Right. - Give it to me. - I'm not giving you a cigarette. It's fine. Do you want to get this part or not? Here. Now, don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that has been missing from your hand. When you hold it, you feel right. You feel complete. - You miss it? - No, not so much. All right. Now we smoke. Oh, my God! - Give me that! - No. You've got options. You can smoke like this: - Chandler - Or hold it in your mouth. Give me the cigarette! - You try. - Thank you. Okay, how's this? Okay, that's not bad. All right, when you're finished, it's cool if you flick it. All right, you keep practicing.. and I'll go put out the sofa. I thought it was foot size. No. It's the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb.. to the tip of his index finger. That's ridiculous. Can I use either thumb? I'd rather go with the foot theory. All right. Don't tell me. Decaf cappuccino for Joey. Coffee, black. Latte. And an iced tea. - I'm getting good at this. - Excellent! Good for me! - You okay, Phoebe? - It's not worth It's my bank. - What did they do? - It's nothing I get my mail and open their monthly ""statement."" Easy! And there's $500 extra in my account. Satan's minions at work again! Now I have to go deal with them - What are you talking about? Keep it! - It's not mine. If I kept it, I'd be stealing. But if you spent it, it would be like shopping. Say I bought a great pair of shoes. Know what I'd hear with every step? ""Not mine. Not mine. Not mine."" Even if I was happy and skipping, I'd hear: ""Not-not mine. Not-not mine."" We're with you. We got it. I'd never be able to enjoy it. It'd be this giant karmic debt. Chandler, what are you doing? What are you doing? Oh, gross! - What is this? - I'm smoking! You've been so good for three years! And this is my reward. Think about what you went through when you quit. Forget about you. Think about what we went through! So this time I won't quit. - Put it out! - I'm putting it out! Oh, no! I can't drink this now. I'm gonna go. I've got a date. With Alan again? How's it going? It's going pretty good. It's nice and we're having fun. When do we get to meet him? Let's see, it's Monday.. - Never. - Come on! Not after what happened with Steve. What do you mean? We love Steve. Steve was sexy! Sorry. I don't know how I feel yet. Let me figure it out. Then can we meet him? No. Sorry. Joey. Let it go. Why should they meet him? I bring a guy home and they're like.. coyotes picking off the weak members of the herd. Listen, as someone who's seen more than her share of bad beef.. I'll tell you, that is not such a terrible thing. Your friends are just looking after you. I wish that once I'd date a guy they liked. You realize the odds of that happening are slimmer.. - if they never get to meet the guy. - I know. - Can't I whimper a little bit? - Whimper. Okay, I'm done. Let it go, Ross. You didn't know Chi-Chi. - Do you all promise? - We promise. We'll be good. Chandler, do you promise to be good? You can come in, but your filter-tip buddy stays outside! ""Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling. We've credited you $500. We're sorry for the inconvenience.. and hope you'll accept this football phone.. as our gift."" Do you believe it? Now I have $ 1000 and a football phone. What bank is this? Okay, it's him. - Who is it? - Alan. Chandler! He's here! Do I look okay? One more button. Closed! How about closed? - I didn't know. - Yeah. Please be good. Remember how much you all like me? Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan. I've heard so much about all you guys. I'll call you tomorrow. Thanks. Let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot? Come on! I'll go. Let's start with how he kept picking I'm sorry, I can't do this. We loved him. We loved him! Wait! We're talking about someone I'm going out with? That pimento trick! I'll never look at an olive the same way again. And did you notice? Know what was great? His smile was crooked. - Yes! Like the man in the shoe! - What shoe? From the rhyme. There was a man With a crooked smile Who lived in a shoe For a while So I think Alan.. is the yardstick by which future boyfriends will be measured. Future boyfriends? - I think this could be ""it."" - Really? I'd marry him for his David Hasselhoff impression alone. You know I'll be doing that at parties. - Know what I like most? - What? The way he makes me feel about myself. How was the game? Well.. We won! Fantastic! Question. How is that possible? - Alan. - He was unbelievable! Like the cartoon where Bugs Bunny plays every position. It was first base, Alan. Second base, Alan.. It was like he made us into a team. We sure showed those Hasidic jewelers a thing or two about softball. Can I ask a question? Do you think Alan is sometimes.. What? I don't know. A little too ""Alan""? Oh, no. Not possible. You can never be too ""Alan."" It's his innate ""Alan-ness"" that we adore. I, personally, could have a gallon of Alan. - Hey, Lizzy. - Hey, weird girl. - I brought alphabet soup. - Pick out the vowels? I left in the Y's. Because, ""sometimes Y."" - And something else. - Saltines? No, $1000 and a football phone. What? Oh, my God! - There's really money in here. - I know. What are you doing? I want you to have it. I don't want it. - I have to give you something. - No, you don't - Do you want my tinfoil hat? - No, you need that. - It's okay. Thanks. - Let me do something. I'll tell you what. Buy me a soda and we're even. Okay? - Okay. - Okay. Keep the change. Thanks, Lizzy. Want a pretzel? - No, I'm fine. Thanks. - See you. A thumb? I know. There it was, just floating.. like this tiny little hitchhiker. Maybe it's a contest. Like ""collect all five."" - Does anyone wanna see? - No, thanks! Don't do that. Come on! It's worse than the thumb. - This is so unfair. - Why is it unfair? So I have a flaw! Big deal! Joey's knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? Ross, over-pronouncing every word. Monica, who snorts when she laughs. I mean, what the hell is that thing? I accept those flaws. Why can't you accept me for this? Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody, or just him? I could live without it. Is it a little annoying? Or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair? Don't listen to him. I think it's endearing. Oh, you do, do you? There's nothing wrong with speaking correctly. Indeed there isn't. I should get back to work. Otherwise someone might get what they ordered. The hair comes out and the gloves come off. Ever go out with a guy your friends really like? No. I'm going out with a guy my friends really like. Are we talking about the coyotes here? All right! A cow got through. Can you believe it? It's just, you know what? I just don't feel the ""thing."" They feel the thing. I don't feel it. Honey, you should always feel the thing. If that's how you feel about the guy, dump him. - It's gonna be really hard. - He'll get over it. No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about. - Don't you respect your body? - Don't you see what you're doing? I've had it with your cancer, emphysema and heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it. Alan wants to speak to you. Really? He does? Hey, buddy! What's up? She told you about that, huh? Well, yeah. I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. It's not that Well, that's true. Gee, you know, no one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay. Thanks. God, he's good. - If only he were a woman. - Yeah. Lamb Chop! How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for 30 years, it'd be talking too. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch. - Where's Joey? - Joey ate my last stick of gum.. so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong? - I think he's across the hall. - Thanks. There you go. I'm alive with pleasure now. Phoebe, do you want the rest of that Pop-Tart? Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart? Hey, I might. I'm sorry. The soda people gave me $7000 for the thumb. And on my way over here I stepped in gum. What is up with the universe? - What's going on? - It's just nice when we're together. It's nicer when everyone gets to wear underwear. Please, guys, we have to talk. Wait! I'm getting a deja vu. No, I'm not. - We have to talk. - There it is! Okay, it's about Alan. Speaking of which, tell him we're on for the Renaissance Fair. Before you get into that, there's something you should know. There's really no easy way to say this. I've decided to break up with Alan. Is there somebody else? No, it's just.. you know, things change. People change. We didn't change. So that's it? It's over? Just like that? You let your guard down. You start to care about someone, and.. - I can go on pretending - Okay! No. That wouldn't be fair to me, Alan, or to you. Well, who wants fair? I just want things back, you know, the way they were. - I'm sorry. - Oh, she's sorry. I feel better. I can't believe this! With the holidays coming up. I wanted him to meet my family. I'll meet someone. There'll be other Alans. Yeah, right! - Are you guys gonna be okay? - We'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time. I understand. - Wow. - I'm really sorry. Yeah, I mean, I'm sorry too. - But I'm a little relieved. - Relieved? Yeah, well, I mean, I had a great time with you. I just can't stand your friends. Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats? That was fun. He could row like a Viking. So how'd it go? You know. Did he mention us? He says he's really gonna miss you guys. - Rough day, huh? - You have no idea. Come here. - That's it. I'm getting cigarettes. - No! I don't care! I'm weak! I've gotta have the smoke! If you never smoke again, I'll give you $7000. Yeah, all right. <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"
105,"Let it go. It's not a big deal. Not a big deal? It's amazing. You reach in, there's one maneuver and bam! A bra. Right out the sleeve. As far as I know, guys don't do anything that comes close. Right? Come on! You guys can pee standing up. We can? Okay, I'm trying that. Know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts anytime they want. You look down, and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me. I don't get how guys can do so many mean things... ...and not even care. -Multiple orgasms! -There you go. The One With the East German Laundry Detergent Saturday night. The big night! Date night! Saturday night. Saturday night! -No plans, huh? -Not a one! Not even breaking up with Janice? Right, right. Shut up. Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. Except for Kevin Millmore, may he rot in hell. -You just gotta do it. -I know. But it's just so hard. You're sitting there with her. She has no idea. You finally get up the courage to do it. There's that awkward moment when you've handed her the note. You try to run out of the restaurant before she's finished the note. Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man. Just stop calling. If you want, I'll do it with you. She'd feel like we're ganging up on her. You dump Janice, I'll dump T ony. -You're breaking up with T ony? -He's sweet, but it's not fun anymore. I don't know if it's me or his hunger strike, I don't know. Do you want anything else? You had a nutty, chocolate-y, kind of cake-y, pie thing that Nothing. I' m fine. What's wrong? Why so scrunchie? My father wants to give me a Mercedes convertible. That guy, he burns me up. Yeah, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. It was horrible! He called me ""young lady. "" I hate when my father calls me that. Did he say ""You' re not up to this"" again? I got the extended version with choruses of... ... ""You'll Never Make it on Your Own. "" Hi, Joey. Oh, my God! Angela! Wow! Being dumped by you agrees with her. -Are you gonna go over there? -No. Yeah. No. Okay, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi... ...three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. -Hey, Angela. -Joey. You look good. That's because l' m wearing a dress that accents my boobs. You don't say. So, Rachel, what are you doing tonight? Big glamour night. Me and Monica at Launderama. You wanna hear a freakish coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too? -Who? -Me! Was that not clear? Why don't...? Why don't I just join you both there? Don't you have a laundry room in your building? Yes. I do have a laundry room in my building. But there's a rat problem. Apparently, they're attracted to dryer sheets. They're going in fine, but they're coming out all fluffy. -Anyway, 7-ish? -Sure. -Forget it. I' m with Bob now. -Bob? Who the hell's Bob? Bob is great. He's smart, sophisticated, and he has a real job. You go on three auditions a month and you' re an actor. Bob Come on! We were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but, like, talking too.

Ugly Naked Guy is laying kitchen tile. Look, l' m asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me. What's going on? You go out with tons of girls. I know, but Angela's different. She's like one of a kind, like a snowflake or.... -Something else like a snowflake? -Yeah, yeah. Look, I made a huge mistake. I never should've broke up with her. Will you help me? Please? Hold on a sec. You need to not touch any of those. Okay, bye. Monica's not coming. It's just gonna be me and Rachel. Hold on, camper. You've thought this through? It's laundry. The thinking-through is minimal. Just you and Rachel? Just you two? This is a date. You're going on a date. -Uh-uh. -Uh-huh. -I haven't done that in a while. -ls it a date if she doesn't know? Yes, absolutely. Saturday night, all rules apply. What are you saying?

I'll be shutting up now. Where are they? Where are they? This is nice. We never do anything, just the two of us. Great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car, run over some puppies. I don't wanna do that. -Here we go. -Have a good breakup. -Hey, Janice. -My God, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day. That's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here? We got the proofs from the shoot with the vegetables. They sucked. I blew off the afternoon. I went shopping. And I got you.... I'm looking. I'm looking. I' m looking. -I got you -What? -What? -What did you get me there? I got you... ...these. Bullwinkle socks. -That's sweet. -I knew you had Rockys. You can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle or Rocky and Rocky, or you can mix. Moose and squirrel. Whatever you want. I'm gonna get another espresso. More latte? No, l' m still working on mine. -That's it? -Yeah, it was really hard. -Yeah, the hug looked pretty brutal. -You weren't there. -Sorry. -How are things going? Going? Things are not going. She got me socks. These go with your Rockys. She really cares about you l' m sorry. Coming through. Move. Move! Excuse me! I was kind of using that machine. Yeah, well, now you' re kind of not. But I saved it. I put my basket on top. I'm sorry. Is that your basket? It's pretty. Unfortunately, I don't see suds! What? No suds, no save, okay? What's going on? Nothing. This horrible woman just took my machine. Was your basket on top? -Yeah, but there were no suds. -So? -You know, no suds, no save. -No suds, no Excuse me. Hold on a second! This is my friend's machine. Hey, hey, hey! Her stuff wasn't in it! Hey, hey, hey! That's not the rule, and you know it! All right. Show's over. Nothing to see here. Okay. Let's do laundry. That was amazing! I can't even send back soup. Well, that's because you' re such a sweet, gentle.... Do you? Do you? Oh, hey. You must need detergent. -What's that? -Uberweiss. It's new. It's German. It's extra tough! Rach, are you gonna separate those? Oh, God. Am I being a total laundry spaz? Am I supposed to use one machine for shirts and another for pants? Have you never done this before? Well, not myself. But I know other people that have. Okay. You caught me. I'm a laundry virgin. Don't worry. I'll use the gentle cycle. Basically, you wanna use one machine for all your whites. A whole other machine for your colors. And a third for your... ...delicates. That would be your bras... ...and your underpanty things. These are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or with delicates? That would be a judgment call. He's so cute! Where did you grow up? -Brooklyn Heights. -Cleveland. -How'd that happen? -My God! What? I suddenly had the feeling I was falling. But I'm not. So, you and Angela, huh? -Yep. Pretty much. -You' re a lucky man. Know what I miss most about her? That cute nibbly noise she makes when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel... ...or a weasel. -I never really noticed. -Oh, yeah, yeah. Listen for it. Monica. Monica is great. Yeah, she is. But it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually. I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific. Yeah, isn't he? It's great to meet a smart, funny guy who's emotionally older than 8. You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed! My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity. That's nice. You can. It's like pulling off a Band-Aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed. Go! Go! Hi, Janice. Here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. All right. Well, there you go. Stop it, stop it, stop it. This isn't about you. I know! It's about your fear of commitment. I' m not afraid. -Please. -I don't! -I don't! I' m ready to commit anytime. -Really? I know this is gonna sound stupid... ... but I feel that if I can do this... ...if I can actually do my own laundry... ...there isn't anything I can't do. That does not sound stupid to me. The first time I had to cook for myself after Carol left me I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross.... -Uh-oh. -What? Uh-oh.... Uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's a song. The laundry song we sing. Uh-oh! The laundry's done -What's the matter? -Nothing. The laundry's done Come on, show me. It's just that you left a red sock with your whites, and now... ...everything's kind of pink. Everything's pink? Except for the red sock, which is still red. Don't be upset. It can happen to anyone. But it happened to me. God, I'm gonna look like a big Marshmallow Peep! What am I doing? My father's right! I can't live on my own. I can't even do laundry! Something went wrong with Underdog and they couldn't inflate his head. So anyway... ...his head is flopping down Broadway, right? And I'm thinking how inappropriate this is. Something's in my eye. Could we check it in the light, please? -Oh, my God! -What? Were we at the same table? It's like... ...cocktails in Appalachia. -They' re close. -Close? Her tongue's in his ear. Like you've never got a little rambunctious with Ross. Joey, this is sick. It's disgusting. It's... ... not really true' is it? Who's to say what's true? -What were you thinking? -l' m not proud of this, okay? Well, maybe I am a little. -l' m out of here! -Wait! You like him. I want her. He likes you. -Really? -Yeah. If we put our heads together, between the two of us... ...we can break them up. I' m sorry. I can't believe I did this. I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story. Waiter? One more plate of chicken wings over here. Here's the thing. We're different. I'm bing, bing, bing. You' re boom, boom, boom. Oh, my God! I' m so sorry! Are you okay? It's just my lens. It's my lens. I'll be right back. I hit her in the eye! In the eye! This is the worst breakup in the history of the world! Oh, my God! -How many have you had? -I don't know. A million! Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. -l' m fine, l' m fine. -All right. -l' m not fine. Here she is. -Wait here, okay? Breathe. -How do you do that? -It's like a gift. We should always break up together. I'd like that! The clothes are clean. That's the important part. I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now. I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart. I had a 24-inch waist. You lose things. Now, come on. Get out of my way. I' m sorry. Maybe I wasn't being clear. This was our cart. There weren't clothes in it! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Quit making up rules! Let go! Come on, it's my cart. Listen, Mitzi, if you want it... ...you' re gonna have to take me with it! -Yes! Did you see that? -You were incredible. A brand-new woman, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. I could not have done this without you. More clothes in the dryer? -I'm fine. I'm fine. -Are you sure? -Are you sure you' re okay? -Yeah. -Does it still hurt? -Yeah. What a neat idea! All your clothes match. I' m gonna do this. -How'd it go? -Excellent! We ripped that couple apart and kept the pieces for ourselves. What a beautiful story. -I'm fine, by the way. -I'm sorry. -Where's Chandler? -He needed time to grieve. I' m free! I' m free!

I just have to know, okay? Is it my hair? Yes, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair. Yeah, you have homosexual hair. So did she...? Twice. -Twice? -Oh, that sucks. -You guys okay? -I don't know. It's weird. I know she's gone, but I just don't feel.... Maybe she's not really gone. No, no, she's gone. We checked. A lot. No, I mean, maybe no one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then... ... I get this feeling that she's right here, you know? And Debbie, my friend from junior high... ...got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course. I always get this strong Debbie vibe... ...when I use a little yellow pencil. -I miss her. -Here, Pheebs. Want this? -Oh, thanks. -Sure. I just sharpened her this morning. I don't believe any of that. When you' re dead... ...you' re dead. You' re gone. You' re worm food. So Chandler looks gay, huh? I don't know who this is, but it's not Debbie. Dad, let's just make a decision. You're right. It's going into the ground. We should get the most basic thing. ""The non-protective corrugated fiberboard with white laminate. "" Dad, we can't bury Nana in a dresser from kea. This is why your mother buys my clothes. I hate to shop. I hate it. Isn't this more about the fact that... ...once you decide, it's like acknowledging Nana's actually gone? No, I really hate to shop. -I thought it'd be a closed casket. -lt doesn't mean she can't look nice. Sweetie, you think you can get in there? I don't see why not. Here's my retainer. I was just thinking... -...when my time comes -Dad. Listen to me. When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea. You what? I wanna be buried at sea. It looks like fun. Define ""fun. "" Come on. You'll make a day of it. You'll get a boat, pack a lunch.... And then we throw your body in the water. Gee, that does sound fun. Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says I'm so predictable. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say, "" Buried at sea? Huh? "" That's probably what they'll say. I'd like that. -Hey, gorgeous. -Hey. Look, l' m sorry about yesterday. Don't worry. Apparently, other people have made the same mistake. Okay. Phew! So, what do you think it is about me? I don't know what. You just have... -...a quality. -A quality. Great. It's a shame. You and Lowell would've made a great couple. Lowell? Financial Services Lowell? That's who you saw me with? What? He's cute. Well, yeah. He's no Brian in Payroll. Is Brian? I don't know. If you were gonna set me up... ... I'd like to think it'd be with somebody like him. Brian's a little out of your league. Excuse me. You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. I'm really not. This one? I've shown you every dress we have. Unless you want her to spend eternity in a lemon-yellow pantsuit... ...go with the burgundy. Whatever we pick, she'd say it's the wrong one. Right. We'll go with the burgundy. A fine choice. I'm coming out. Wait! We need shoes. -How about these? -That's really a day shoe. Where she's going everyone else will be dressier? Could we see something in a slimmer heel? I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something silver that may work. -No, it really should be burgundy. -Unless we go with a different dress. No, no, no. Watch this. Wait, I may have something in the back. Oh, my God. Is everything all right? Just Nana's stuff. You guys ready? Mom called to tell me not to wear my hair up. -Know my ears aren't my best feature? -Some days it's all I can think about. I' m sorry l' m late. I couldn't find my bearings. You mean your earrings? What did I say? -Are these the shoes? -Yes. Paolo sent them from ltaly. What? We don't have shoes here? -Morning. We ready to go? -Don't we look nice all dressed up? It's stuff like that, isn't it? -lt was a really beautiful service. -lt really was. Come here, sweetheart. You know, I think it's time for you to start using night cream. What? Nothing. Just that your coat sounds like Brent Musberger. -Check it out. Giants-Cowboys. -You're watching football at a funeral? No, it's the pre-game. I' m gonna watch it at the reception. You're a frightening, frightening man. Oh, no! My new Paolo shoes! I hope they're not ruined. God, what a great day! What? Weather-wise. I know. The air, the trees. Even though Nana's gone, there's something almost life Ross, are you okay? No, l' m fine. Just... ... having my worst fear realized, but.... I' m just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm. -What? What is it? -You missed a belt loop. Okay, it's in spasm. Here, sweetie. I took these when I had my gall thing accident. Thanks, Mom. Sorry. Hi, l' m Andrea. I'm Dorothy's daughter. Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is. Look who's up! -How do you feel? -I feel great. I feel great. I feel great. Wow, those pills really worked. Yeah. Not the first two, but the second two.... I love you guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister. I love Pheebs. That's so nice. I love you, man. And listen, if you wanna be gay, be gay! It doesn't matter to me. You were right. I do love you. Oh, Ross. I love you too. Oh, no, I really love you. I really love you. Oh, you don't get it! -What do you got there? -Just a hearing disability. What's the score? 1 7-1 4, Giants. Three minutes to go in the third. Beautiful! Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker? Your grandmother would've hated this. Sure. What with it being her funeral and all. No, I'd be hearing about... ...why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham. Or I didn't spend enough on flowers. Or she'd say: ""Why waste your money? I don't need flowers, l' m dead. "" That sounds like Nana. Do you know what it's like to grow up... ...with someone who is critical of every single thing you say? I can imagine. It's a wonder your mother turned out... ...to be the positive, life-affirming person she is. That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again... ... I mean, if she was here right now... ...would you tell her? T ell her what? How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail. Like your hair, for example. I'm not sure I know what you're getting at. Would things have been better if you'd just told her the truth? Some things are better left unsaid. It's nicer when people just get along. More wine? Oh, I think so. Those earrings look really lovely on you. Thank you. They're yours. Actually, they were Nana's. Now l' m depressed! Even more than I was. Oh, look. My first grade picture. Please ignore the Dy-no-mite T -shirt. -Hey, who's this little naked guy? -That little naked guy would be me. Look at the little thing! Yes, fine. That is my penis. Can we be grownups now? Who are those people? -Got me. -That's Nana right there in the middle. Yeah, let's see. "" Me and the gang at Java Joe's. "" You look just like your grandmother. How old was she? Let's see, "" 1 939. "" Twenty-four, twenty-five. It looks like a fun gang. Look, look, look! I got Monica naked! Let me see! No, no. That would be me again. I'm just trying something. Hey, Lowell. Oh, hey, Chandler. So how's it going in Financial Services? It's like Mardi Gras without the papier-mache heads. How about you? Good. Good. Listen... ...I don't know what Shelly told you about me, but... ... I' m not. I know. That's what I told her. Really? So you can tell? Pretty much. Most of the time. We have a kind of radar. So you don't think I have... ...a quality? Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian, from Payroll? He is. -He is? -And way out of your league. Out of my league! I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. Hey, Brian. <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"

I'm familiar with the concept. -We can just look for it. -Okay. Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about being a lesbian. Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise they don't let you do it. Hey, Yertle the Turtle! A classic. Actually, I'm reading it to the baby. The baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're crazy? You don't think they can hear sounds in there? You' re not serious? I mean, you really talk to it? Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice. Well, that's just Do you talk about me? -Yeah.

But I just liked it better before. It was better. She took it pretty well. Paolo's over there now, so.... We should go and see if she's okay. Just one second. -Score! -Game! Nice! Come on, Pheebs. Well, it looks like we kicked your butts. She did. You could be on the Olympic ""Standing There"" team. Come on. Two on one. Why are you here? She just broke up with him. It's time for you to swoop in. -What, now? -Yes. Now is when you swoop. When Paolo walks out, you gotta be the first guy she sees. She's gotta know you' re everything he's not. You' re the anti-Paolo. My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You' re there for her. You pick up the pieces and then you usher in ""The Age of Ross. "" -See this? See? -Hold it! Ascolta! -How's it going? -Don't stare. She threw his clothes off the balcony. Now there's gesturing and arm-waving. That is, "" How could you? "" or "" Enormous breasts! "" Here he comes. I am... ...to say goodbye. Okay, bye-bye. Paolo, I really hate you for what you did, but I still have five of these... ...so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles. I just wanna tell you, and I think I'd speak for everyone when I say.... Oh, just look at her. Guys, I think only one of us should go... -...so she's not overwhelmed. -Right. And I really think it should be me. You all right? I've been better. I don't believe this. I wasn't supposed to care about this guy. It was just supposed to be this big, fun, ltalian thing. Someday I could look back and say, ""That was a big, fun, ltalian thing. "" It wasn't supposed to feel like this when it was over. Come here. Listen... ...you deserve so much better than him. I mean, you... ...should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you. What? I' m so sick of guys! I don't want to look at or think about another guy. I don't even want to be near another guy. Ross, you' re so great. -Are you all right? -Are you okay? -Medium. Any cookies left? -Yeah. See, Rach... ... I don't think swearing off guys altogether is the answer. What you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process. I just need to be by myself for a while. -I just gotta figure out what I want. -No, no. See, because not all guys out there are gonna be a Paolo. No, I know. I know. And l' m sure your little boy's not gonna grow up to be one. -What? -What? I' m having a boy? No. No. In fact, you' re not having a boy. I' m having a boy. -Huh? Am I having a boy? -You' re having a boy! I' m having a boy! -l' m having a boy! -What is it? I' m having a boy! I' m having a boy! We already knew that! I' m having a son. Yes! And that would be a shutdown! Shutout! Where you going? One more game! -It's 2:30 in the morning. -Yeah, get out! You guys always hang out in my apartment. I'll only use my left hand. Come on, wussies! All right! Okay! I gotta go! I' m going. And l' m gone. -One more game? -Oh, yeah. <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"

I can still see... ...your nippular areas. The One With The Boobies Honey, tell them the story about your patient... ...who thinks things are other things. When the phone rings and she takes a shower. That's pretty much it. -But you tell it really well, sweetie. -Thanks. Okay. Now go away so we can talk about you. Okay. I'll miss you. -lsn't he great? -He's cute. He likes you so much. I know. He's so sweet. And so complicated, you know? And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky. Think you'll do it on his couch? I don't know. That's a little weird. It's vinyl. Okay, you guys want anything else? -Could I have? -We're all out. Anybody else? Did I miss something? No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies. What were you doing seeing her boobies? It was an accident. I wasn't across the street with a telescope. Can we change the subject, please? These aren't her ""boobies."" These are her breasts. Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change. I always liked ""Bazoombas."" Gives them a Latin spin. Can we drop this already, please? Why are you embarrassed? They were very nice boobies. ""Nice""? They were ""nice""? That's it? I mean, mittens are ""nice."" Okay. Rock, hard place. Me. You're so funny! He's really funny. I wouldn't wanna be there when the laughter stops. Whoa, back up there, sparky. What did you mean by that? It seems that maybe you have intimacy issues... ...that you use your humor to keep people at a distance. I mean, I just met you. I don't know you from Adam. Only child, right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty. -How did you know that? -It's textbook. Hey, you guys. You all know my dad, right? -How long are you in the city? -Two days. I got a job. I'm better off staying with Joey... ...than going back and forth on the ferry. -I don't know this one. -This is my friend Roger. -Good to meet you. -You too. -What happened to the puppet guy? -Dad. Oh, excuse me. So, Ross, how's the wife? 0 for 2, huh? Chandler, say something funny. I gotta go. Miss you too. -I love you, but it's getting late -Say hi. Hey, Ma. I made the appointment with Dr. Bassida and Excuse me? Did you know this isn't Ma? Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician. Sure. So, how long you been...? Remember when you were a kid, I'd take you to the navy yard? -Since then? -No, it's only been six years. I wanted you to think of a nice memory so you'd know I'm not a terrible guy. -What are you doing? -Chopping garlic. You don't crush it? You're having an affair, I chop garlic. It's a wacky world. Joe, you ever been in love? -I don't know. -Then you haven't. -You're burning tomatoes. -You're one to talk. Your dad's in love. The worst part is, it's with two different women. Oh, man! Please tell me one of them is Ma. Of course one of them's Ma. What's the matter with you? It's like if you woke up and found out... ...your dad leads this double life. He's like actually some spy working for the ClA. That'd be cool. This blows! Do you think Dad cheated? I don't think so. That would involve sex. I'd like to think that our parents don't do that. I know. Why can't parents just stay parents? Why do they have to become people? Why do they have? Why... ...can't you stop staring at my breasts? What? What? Didn't you get a good enough look? We're all adults here. There's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies you have to show her your pee-pee. You know, I don't see that happening. Come on. He's right. Tit for tat. Well, I'm not showing you my tat! -It's Phoebe. -And Rog! Come on up. Oh, good! Rog is here. -What's the matter with Rog? -It's a little thing. I hate that guy! So he was a little analytical. That's what he does. Come on, he's not that bad. You're wrong! Why would I marry her... ...if I thought that she was a lesbian? I don't know. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail. Why? Why would l? Why? I don't know. Maybe low self-esteem? Maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling. Maybe Wait! Go back to that ""sibling"" thing. Well, I don't know. You could've sabotaged your marriage... ...so the sibling would feel like less of a failure. That's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures. -You think I'm a failure? -lsn't he good? Yeah. No, that's not what I was saying. I thought you were on my side. But maybe you sucked up to them so they'd favor you. I married a lesbian to make you look good! You're right. I mean, you're right. It wasn't just the Weebles, but the Weeble Play Palace... ...and the Weeble's Cruise Ship... ...with this lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in. And Mom just gave them all away. That's tough, tough stuff. Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta go. -Feel better. -We're gonna be late, sweetie. -Thanks for everything, Mon. -No problem. Listen, it was great seeing you again. Mon, easy on those cookies, okay? Remember, they're just food, they're not love. I hate that guy! Good night, you guys. Oh, look. It's the woman we ordered. Hey, can we help you? No, thanks. I'm just waiting for Joey Tribbiani. I'm Joey Tribbiani. Oh, no, not you. Big Joey. Oh, my God! You're so much cuter than your pictures. I'm Ronni. Cheese Nip? Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a nip. Most people, when their pets pass on... ...want them like they're sleeping. Occasionally you get a person who wants them in a pose. Like chasing their tail. Or jumping to catch a Frisbee. Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys. -That's a good one! -Hey. Hey, Dad. Ronni's here. -Hi. -Hey. Hello, babe! What are you doing here? Oh, you left your hair at my place. I thought you'd need it tomorrow. Thank you. So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk? Look, I shouldn't have come. I better go. I'll miss the train. -I don't want you taking that thing. -Where do I stay? Here? We'll go to a hotel. We'll go to a hotel. -No, you won't. -No, we won't. If you go to a hotel, you'll be doing stuff. I want you here so I can keep an eye on you. -You're gonna keep an eye on us? -Right. As long as you are under my roof... ...you're gonna live by my rules. That means no sleeping with your girlfriend. Wow, he's strict. Dad, you'll be in my room. You can stay in Chandler's room. And Chandler will be? Out here with me, bunking up. Oh, bunking up. If you smell s'mores, don't be alarmed. Thanks. You're a good kid. I'll show you to my room. That sounds weird not followed by, ""No, it's late."" This is just for tonight. Tomorrow you gotta change. Change? -Break up with Ronni -I can't! Then come clean with Ma! This is not right! I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room! Hey, kickie! -What are you doing? -Getting comfortable. -I can't sleep in my underwear. -Well, you're gonna. I was thinking about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls.... Are they end-to-end, or tall, like pancakes? You know, how I date all these women. I always figured, when the right one comes along... ... I'll be able to go the distance. Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking You're not him, you're you. When they wanted you in your father's business, did you cave? -No. -No. You chose the out-of-work-actor business. That wasn't easy, but you did it. I believe when the right woman comes along... ...you'll have the guts to say, ""No, thanks, I'm married."" -You really think so? -Yeah, I really do. -Thanks, Chandler. -Get off! -Hi. -Hi. May I help you? Joey said I could use your shower since Chandler's in ours. Okay. Who are you? Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rapalono. The mistress? -Come on in. -Thanks. I'm Rachel. Bathroom's there. Ronni, how long has Chandler been in the shower? Oh, like five minutes. Perfect. Fasten your seat belts, it's pee-pee time. -Hey, Mr. Trib. -Hey, good morning, dear. Chandler Bing, it's time to see your thing. -What's with you? -I thought it was Chandler! You were supposed to be in there so I'd see your thing! Sorry, my thing was in there with me. -How's it going? -Good. Roger's having a dinner thing. He wanted me to invite you guys. -So, what's going on? -Nothing. It's just.... It's Roger, you know? There's something about We just feel that he's.... -We hate that guy! -We hate him! -We're sorry, Pheebs. -Okay. Don't you think it's just that he's so perceptive... ...it freaked you out? No, we hate him! I'm sorry. -Ma! What are you doing here? -I came to give you this and this! Big ring! Why'd you fill your father's head with garbage... ...about making things right? Things were fine this way! There's chicken in there. Put it away. For God's sake, Joey! Really. -Hold on. You knew? -Of course I knew. What do you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should've heard his stories. ""I'm sleeping over at my accountant's."" -What is that? Please! -So then, how could you? Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling. Nothing made him happy. Not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle. Now he's happy. I mean, it's nice. He has a hobby. Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful... ... but what the hell are you talking about? -I mean, what about you? -Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world... ...there'd be no her and your father would look like Sting. And something else: Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along... ... he's so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive. He's been more loving. It's like every day is our anniversary. -I'm happy for you? -Well, don't be! Now everything's screwed up. I just want it the way it was. Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want. I know you did, cookie. I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her? Yeah. -You're 10 times prettier than she is. -That's sweet. Could I take her? With this ring, no contest. Oh, no! Don't ever do that! -What? -I'm sorry. I have a thing, which means you can't ever do that! -What's wrong, sweetie? -Nothing. -No, what's wrong? Come on. -Okay. It's nothing. I'm fine. It's just It's my friends. They have a liking problem with you... ...in that they don't. They don't? But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all the good and sweet stuff. -They think you're a little -What? Intense and creepy. -Oh. -But I don't. Me, Phoebe. -I'm not at all surprised about that. -That's why you're so great. It's quite typical behavior... ...when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. You know, this kind of codependent, emotionally stunted... ...sitting in your stupid coffeehouse, with your stupid big cups... ...which might as well have nipples on them. And you're all like, ""Oh, define me! Define me! Love me! I need love! You talked to your dad? He's gonna keep cheating on Ma like she wanted. Ma will keep pretending she doesn't know. And my sister, Tina, can't see her husband. He got a restraining order. Which has nothing to do with it. I found out today. Things have changed here on Waltons'mountain. -So, Joey, are you okay? -Yeah, I guess. It's just You know, they're parents. After a certain point, you gotta let go. You gotta let them make their own mistakes. And think, in a few years, we'll turn into them. Oh, please. If I turn into my parents, I'll be an alcoholic blond chasing men... ...or I'll end up like my mom! -Hey. -Hey, Pheebs. How's it going? Okay, except I broke up with Roger. -Yeah, right. -No, no, really. -What happened? -I don't know. I mean... ... he's a good person, and he can be really sweet. In some ways, I think he is so right for me. It's just.... I hate that guy! Hi, Joey. What's going on? Clear the tracks for the boobie payback. Next stop, Rachel Greene. Joey, what the hell were you doing? Sorry, wrong boobies! Hello, Joey! Hello, dear! <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"

The Rachel thing isn't happening, your ex-wife's a lesbian.... I don't think we need a third. Could we get an egg, still in the shell? An egg? Go up to her and say, ""I'm returning your egg."" I think it's winning. -It's insane. -She'll love it. -Thank you. -Thank you. Here. Go with the egg, my friend. Go, go, go! -Think it'll work? -No way. It's suicide. The One With The Candy Hearts -You can't do this. -Do what? -Roger wants to take her out. -No! Remember why you dumped him? Because he was creepy. And mean. And frightening. Still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day! You can go out with a creep any night. I know I do. -What are you doing tomorrow night? -That depends on how tonight goes. -About tonight -Don't you bail on me! I said I'd bring a friend for her friend. -But her friend sounds like a -Pathetic mess. I know, but.... Come on. She's needy, vulnerable. I'm thinking.... Thanks. You haven't been out with a woman since Janice. You're doing this. -She said yes. -Way to go, man! Still got the egg, huh? How do I look? I don't care. There's Lorraine. No trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess. Hi, Joey. Well, well! Look what you brought! Very nice. And what did you bring? She's checking her coat. I'm gonna wash the cab smell off of my hands. Get me a white zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice. Janice? Janice!? Oh... ... my... ...God! Hey, it's Janice! Okay, I'm making a break for it! I've been waiting for, like, forever to go out with Lorraine. -Just calm down. -Calm down? You set me up with a woman I've dumped twice in the last five months! Can you stop yelling? You're making me nervous and.... I can't go when I'm nervous. I'm sorry, you're right. Come on! Do it, do it! Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete. -Who? -Pete the Weeper. The guy that used to cry every time we had sex? ""Was it good for you?"" I'd take crying any day over Howard, the ""I win"" guy! ""I win! I win!"" We went out for two months. I didn't win once. How do we end up with these jerks? We're some kind of magnets. I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch. There's more beer, right? You know my friend who shaves her head? No. I have this friend who shaves her head. She says to break the bad boyfriend cycle... ...you can do a cleansing ritual. Pheebs, this woman is voluntarily bald. Yeah. We can do it tomorrow night. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect. Okay, what kind of ritual? We can burn the stuff they gave us. Or...? Or we can chant and dance around naked with sticks. Burning's good. You know... ... I can pick up quarters with my toes. Yeah? Good for you. Quarters or rolls of quarters? By the way, I cut you out of all of my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads. That's okay. You could make little puppets out of them. And you could use them in your Theater of Cruelty! -We can't do that! -What? What can't you do? Can I talk to you for a second? Over there? We might be leaving now. Tell me it's you and me ""we."" She wants to slather my body with stuff and lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is! But I definitely want to be a part of it! Okay, you cannot do this to me. You're right. I'm sorry. Can we have three chocolate mousses to go? I'm out of here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I hope she throws up on you. Thanks. -So.... -Just us. What a crappy night! I have enjoyed the fact... ...that your shirt's been sticking out of your zipper. Excuse me. How you doing? So do we have the best friends, or what? Joey's not a friend. He's... ...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Dessert? A big-screen TV? -I'll have a drink. -Got it. Good woman! -A bottle of overpriced champagne. -Each. That's right, each. And a rob roy. I've always wanted to know. Happy Valentine's Day! Oh, I miss you already. -Can you believe this happened? -No, no! And yet it did. -Goodbye, Janice. -kiss me!

That's right, it's me! How did you know? So, if dogs experience jet lag... ... because of the seven dog years to one human year thing... ...when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles... ... he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses a week and a half. That's funny! They should be cooking the food soon. Oh, good. Who are they? The blond is my ex-wife. The woman touching her is her... ...close, personal friend. -They're lovers? -lf you want to put a label on it. -Anything else I should know? -Nope. That's it. Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. Hello! Now we need sage branches and the sacramental wine. All I had is oregano and a Fresca. That's okay! Now we need the semen of a righteous man. If we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place. -Can we start throwing things in? -Yeah, okay! Okay. Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts. And I have the receipt from my dinner with.... -A picture of Scotty Jared naked! -Let me see! -He's wearing a sweater. -No. -Whose MCl card is that? -Mine. Shoot! Remember this number: Nine, seven, four.... Okay, and here we have the last of Paolo's grappa. Wait, isn't it almost pure How can I dump this woman on Valentine's Day? I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush. Hello, funny valentine! Hi, just Janice. Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker. I could just kiss you all over, and I'm gonna. If you don't do it, I will. -So are you actually from New York? -Not originally. I'm from -You said they'd shoot it without you. -I thought they could. The maxi-pads were a piece of cake. Mini-pads should be that much easier. -It's Valentine's Day. -I know, but it's my job. I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm spending most of my time teaching science... ...which is funny because that wasn't even my major. Now, that is funny! Do you think it would be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? Because she's alone now. And pregnant. And sad. -I guess. -Are you sure? Carol! -Wanna join us? -No, I'm fine. Come on. These people will scooch down. You guys will scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on! -Come on. -Thank you. IKristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristen. -How do you do? -Carol teaches sixth grade. And Kristen.... IKristen does something... ...that, funnily enough... ...wasn't even her major! -Thanks for coming over. -Not at all. It's pretty much our job. That's why we get the cool hats. -What do we got there? -A piece of sik boxer shorts. Some greeting cards. A half-charred picture of.... That guy's hairier than the chief! It's a really funny story how this happened. I was taking out the trash, and Phoebe was burning incense It's all right. This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire we've seen get out of control. -Third one tonight. -Really? Valentine's is our busiest night of the year. Next time you're burning your ex-boyfriend's stuff: One, do it in a well-ventilated area. Two, if you wanna burn his clothing, stay away from synthetic fabrics. Three, try to let go of the anger, and learn to love yourself. -I brought you something. -ls it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. ""Chan and Jan Forever."" I had them made special. Okay, Janice. Hey, Janice. There's no way to tell you this. At least, there's no new way. I just don't think things are gonna work out. That's fine. It is? Because I know that this isn't the end. You see, actually, it is. No, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing! Oh, no, I don't. Why do we keep ending up together? New Year's, who invited who? -Valentine's, who asked who into bed? -I did, but You seek me out! Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn! Janice! Janice! You push me away, you pull me back! You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know it. You just don't know you know it. See? Call me! It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine. You did so, I swear to How long has she been in the bathroom? She isn't in the bathroom. Her coat's gone. Well, maybe it's cold in there. I screwed up my first date in nine years. -That could be it. -Oh, God. You know, this is still pretty hot. Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some might stay through dinner. -I'm sorry. That's not funny. -It's just.... You know the whole ""get on with your life"" thing? Well, do I have to? I'm sitting here with this cute woman... ...and she's perfectly nice, but that... ...that's it. Then I'm here talking to you, and it's easy and it's fun. And I don't have to.... -I know. -You know? Here's a wacky thought. Let's say you and I give it another shot. I know what you're gonna say. You're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now. Let's just stick a pin in it. Because we're great together. You can't deny it. I've got a ring at home that fits you. I've got lots of pictures with both of us in them. And best of all, you're carrying my baby. -I mean, how perfect is that? -Ross You keep saying that, but there's something right here. I love you. I love you too. -But -No ""but."" You know that thing we put over here with the pin in it? It's time to take the pin out. You'll find someone. The right woman is waiting for you. It's easy for you to say. You found one already. All you need is a woman who likes men, and you'll be set. Not her. So, you guys really slide down a pole? -Absolutely. -That's so cool. How do you get back up? Well, we rarely have to return from a fire as quickly. So, would you guys.... Would you like to, sometime, maybe.... Go for a drink sometime? Sure, sounds good. We get off at midnight. We'll pick you up then. Okay. Great! So will you bring the truck? I'll even let you ring the bell. -We'll see you later. -Bye! See you later! Oh, my God! See? There you go. The cleansing worked.

Miss Tedlock, you look lovely today. That is a very flattering sleeve length on you. Mr. Costilick would like you to stop by his office today. If it's about those prank memos, I wasn't involved. Nothing at all. Really. And frankly, those shenanigans have no place in an office environment. Hey, you guys! Chandler's coming and he has incredible news. So when he gets here, let's all act, like, you know Never mind. But it was gonna be really good. What's going on? So it's a typical day at work... ...and Big Al tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor. -That is great! -Congratulations! So I quit. Why? Why? This was a temp job. Chandler, you've been there for five years. I know, but if I took it, I'd be admitting that this is what I do. Does that mean we have to start buying our own toilet paper? That was Joey Tribbiani with the big picture. Dan? Was it more money? Doesn't matter. I just don't want to be a guy who sits in his office... ...worrying about the WENUS. The ""WENUS""? Weekly estimated net usage system. It's a processing term. Oh, that WENUS. What will you do? I don't know. But I won't figure it out working there. I have something you can do! I have this new massage client, Steve. Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant... ...and he's looking for a head chef. -Hi, there. -Hi. I know. You're a chef and I thought of you first. But Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so.... I just don't have a lot of chef-ing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant. What is he looking for? He wants to do something eclectic. He's looking for someone who can create the entire menu. So, what do you think? Thanks. I just don't see myself in a big, white hat. Oh, Monica! Guess what? a perfect run-up and there he goes, a perfect.... Watch stuff like this... ...and you realize why evolution is just a theory. Can you see my nipples through this shirt?

It's not too big or too small. It's just right. Was it formerly owned by a blond woman and some bears? I'm cooking for him Monday, kind of an audition. Phoebe, he wants you here. It's great. You can make yummy noises. -What are you gonna make? -Yummy noises. -And Monica, what are you gonna make? -I don't know. It's gotta be great. I know what you can make! I know! You should make that thing with the stuff. You know that thing with the stuff? Okay, I don't know. Anyone know a good date place in the neighborhood? How about Tony's? If you finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free. Anyone know a good place if you're not dating a puma? -Who are you going out with? -ls this the bug lady? ""I love you, Ross."" Her name is Celia and she's insect curator at the museum. -What are you gonna do? -Go out to dinner... ...then bring her back to my place and introduce her to my monkey. And he's not speaking metaphorically. So back to your place? You thinking maybe.... Well, I don't know.... I'm hoping.... That monkey is a chick magnet. She'll take one look at his cute, little face and it'll seal the deal. Celia, don't worry. He's not gonna hurt you! Soothing tones. -Here, Marcel. -I can't stand this. -He's got his claws on my -Yeah, all right. Okay, try this salmon mousse. Good. Is it better than the other salmon mousse? -It's creamier. -Yeah? Well, is that better? I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down. God, what happened to you? Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests... ...intelligence tests, personality tests, and what do I learn? ""You're suited for data processing for a large multinational corporation."" That's so great! You already know how to do that. Can you believe it? Don't I seem like I should be doing something cool? I just always pictured myself doing something.... Something! Chandler, I know, I know. Hey, you can see your nipples through this shirt. Maybe this will cheer you up. I had a grape about five hours ago, so I better split this with you. It's supposed to be small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amuse-bouche. Well, it is amusing. Hi, Wendy. Yeah, 8:00. What did we say, $10 an hour? Okay, great. All right, I'll see you then. -$10 an hour for what? -A waitress from work is helping me. Waitressing? Of course I thought of you. But.... -But.... -But, but.... But it's just this night has to go just perfect, you know? Wendy's more of a professional waitress. And I'm maintaining my amateur status so I can waitress in the Olympics.

I don't think I'm a dirty-talking kind of guy. Just say what you wanna do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Try something on me. Please be kidding. Why not? Just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now. I'm in my apartment.... -Yeah, what else? -You're not there. -We're not having this conversation. -All right, I'll start. Ready? Oh, Ross... ...you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now. -Now you say something. -I really don't think so. You like this woman, right? You wanna see her again, right? If you can't talk dirty to me, how will you talk dirty to her? Now tell me you wanna caress my butt! Okay, turn around. I don't want you staring at me. All right, I'm not looking. Go ahead. Okay.

Hey, Mr. Costilick. How's life on the 1 5th floor? Yeah, I miss you too. It's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home. That's very generous. But this isn't about the money.

And he didn't listen, so we left him in the emergency room. -Mon, I'm sorry. -What a tool. -You did the right thing. -You don't wanna work for that guy. I just thought that this was it. -Don't worry. You're an amazing chef. -Those yummy noises? I wasn't faking. Am I gonna get paid for the full three hours? Just a question. We'll talk about it later. So, how did it go with Celia? -I was unbelievable. -All right, Ross! I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif. At one point, there were villagers. And? By the time we finished all the dirty talk... ...it was late and we were exhausted -You cuddled. -Yeah, which was nice. Do you guys want to try to catch a late movie? -Shouldn't we wait for Chandler? -Where the hell is he? I know what time it is... ...but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy! Let me tell you something. You will care about it because I care about it. Got it? Good! How's this? Sorry. How about over here? That means it's working. -Does this hurt? -No. How about this?

Hi, Mr. Heckles. You're doing it again. We're not doing anything. We're just sitting around talking quietly. I can hear you through the ceiling. My cats can't sleep. You don't even have cats.

In fact, he mentioned the word ''frenzy. '' She seems so. . . . Oh, no, no. Nina? She's. . . . In fact, if you asked her now. . . . . .she'd have no recollection of being fired at all. That's unbelievable. And yet believable. So I decided not to fire her again. . . . . .until I'm sure she will be of no threat to herself or others. I see. You never really know what's going on inside a person's head. Well, I guess that's why they call it psychology, sir. The sound Mom and Dad will never forget.

For the past few days, people have been avoiding me. . . . . .and giving me strange looks. Oh, well, maybe that's because. . . . . .they're jealous of us. Maybe. But that doesn't explain why they keep taking my scissors. Well, maybe that's because you're getting a big raise! -I am? -Sure. Why not? Oh, my God! You're amazing! Oh, you don't know. Helen, make sure we do the paperwork on Miss Bookbinder's raise. You still want me to send her psychological profile to personnel? Helen drinks.

And then there's Randy Brown. . . . . .who was like. . . . Have you ever had a boyfriend who was your best friend? Well, but that's what he was for me. And she, you know, kind of stole him away. . . . . .and then broke his heart. And then he wouldn't even talk to me anymore. He didn't want to be around anything that looked like either one of us. I mean, I know Joey's not my boyfriend or my thermos. . . . . .or anything, but. . . . -You won't lose him. -You gotta talk to Joey. Yeah, okay. He doesn't know this stuff. If he knew how you felt. . . . He's falling in love with her. They've been going out a week. They haven't even slept together yet. I mean, that's not serious. May we help you? What are you doing?

It's from the cellars of Ernest and Tova Borgnine. -How could we resist? -That's great! -So, Monica, how's the ankle? -It's. . . . Why don't you tell them? After all, it is your ankle. It's feeling a lot better. Thank you. Why don't you guys sit down, and we'll get you some glasses. Stat! Listen, why don't we just tell them who we really are? -I think it'll be fine. -It will not. We'll get in trouble. Would you stop being such a wuss! A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world. -So? -So they still seem normal. Because they are. When we go out with women we meet at the hospital-- Would you relax? Take a look around. There are no pagan altars. No piles of bones in the corners. They're fine. Go like this: We are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a big baby! -I am not a baby. -Be serious. -You get uptight-- -You act like a princess. You know what? You know what? Every day you are becoming more and more like your mother. Excuse me. Here we go. This is a great place. How long have you lived here? Thanks. I've been here about six years. And Rachel moved in a few months ago. See, I was supposed to get married. . . . . .but I left the guy at the altar. Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but. . . . . .hey, that's me! Why don't you try the hummus? Monica, what do you do? I am a chef at a restaurant uptown. Good for you. Yeah, it is. Mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do. Well, this hummus is great. God bless the chickpea. Oh, God! I am so spoiled! That's it. And have I mentioned that back in high school. . . . . .I was a cow? I used to wet my bed. I use my breasts to get other people's attention. We both do that! Monica and Rachel's apartment. Just one second. Rachel, it's your dad. Hi, Dad. No, no. It's me. Listen, Dad, I can't talk right now. But there's something. . . . There's something I've been meaning to tell you. Excuse me. Remember back in freshman year? Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed. Daddy. . . . Why? Why would I sleep with Billy Dreskin? His father tried to put you out of business! You are dead! Ross, he's got the remote again. Good. Maybe he can switch it back. Maybe not. Hold on a second and let me just check and see if she's here. It's the woman from the hospital. There's a problem with the form. Oh, God, what do we do? Just find out what they want. Okay. No, you do it. Hello. This is Monica. Yes, we'll be right down. Thank you. We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms. -You're right, this wasn't worth it. -Thank you. Let me just change. Trouble? Your sister stood me up the other night. Oh, no. Don't you hate it when people aren't there for you? -Did you try calling her? -I've been trying for two days. When I called the restaurant, they said she was busy. I can't believe she's blowing me off! You got a minute? Yeah, I'm just working. I got you a birthday present. Wow, you remembered! It's a Judy Jetson thermos. Like the kind you-- Right. Oh, I got something for you too. How'd you know I was coming? Yeah, twin thing. I can't believe you did this. I can't believe you. . . . . .did this! So what's the deal with you and Joey? Oh, right. He is so great. But that's over. -Does he know? -Who? Joey. You know, he's really nutsy about you. He is? Why? You got me. Excuse me. . . . . .doesn't this come with a side salad? So are you gonna call him? -You think he likes me? -No. Joey. No, no. He is so smart. He'll figure it out. Do you want some chicken? No, no. No food with a face, remember? You have not changed. Yeah, you too. Hi! Remember us? You just called about needing a signature on the admissions form? Well, it turns out we need a whole new one. Because, you see. . . . . .I put the wrong name again. -Because-- -You're that stupid! I am. I'm that stupid! And I'm just gonna pay for this with a check. Your insurance will cover that. Yeah, I know. I'm just not that bright either. Okay, worst case scenario: Say you never feel like a father. Say your son never feels connected to you as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this. Do you have a point? You know, you'd think I would. What's up with the simian? It's just a fur ball. Whose turn is it? Yours. I got 43 points for ''kidney. '' No, you got zero points for ''idney. '' I had a ''K. '' Where's my ''K''? You've got to help me! My monkey swallowed a ''K'' ! Get that animal out of here! The animal hospital is across town. He's choking! -What is it? -Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile. Excuse me. This hospital is for people! He is people! He has a name, okay? He watches Jeopardy!... . . .he touches himself when nobody's watching. Please have a heart. -I'll take a look at him. -Thank you. -Michael! -Rachel. -What? -Monica. Urs! I've been trying to call you. Listen. . . . Don't say ''listen. '' I know that ''listen. '' I've said that ''listen. '' I'm sorry. I don't get it. What happened? What about what you said under the bridge? Forget about what I said under the bridge. I was talking crazy that night. I was so drunk. You don't drink. That's right, I don't. But I was drunk on you. But it's not gonna work. Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe? If it was, would you stop hanging out with her? No, I couldn't do that. Then, yeah, it's because of Phoebe. So you know, it's either her or me. Then I'm sorry. You're gonna be really hard to get over. I know. I don't know whether it's just because we're breaking up or what. . . . . .but you've never looked so beautiful. Really? Pheebs? He looks so tiny. -We just got the message. -Is he okay? The doctor got the ''K'' out. He also found an ''M'' and an ''O. '' We think he was trying to spell out ''monkey. '' The doctor says he'll be fine. He's just sleeping now. So you feel like a dad yet? No. Why? Come on, you came through. You did what you had to do. That's very ''dad. '' He's waking up. Hey, fella. How you doing? <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"

What? Could you want her more? Who? Dee, the sarcastic sister from What's Happening!!. Look, I'm totally over her. -Hi! -Coffee? -No, we're fine. -Okay. -Shut up! -We're not saying anything. -What? -Joey cried last night. -Thank you. -We were playing poker There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight. You should have seen him. ""Read them and weep!"" And then he did. Now, how come you guys have never played poker with us? Yeah, what is that? Like some kind of sexist guy thing? -It's poker, so only guys can play? -No. Women can play. Then, what is it? Some kind of, like, some kind of, you know All right, what is it? There are just no women in our game. We just don't know any women who know how to play poker. That is a lame excuse. It's a typical guy response. Do you know how to play? No. -But you could teach us. -No. Okay, so now we draw cards. So I wouldn't need any. I have a straight. -Oh, good for you! -Congratulations! -Pheebs, how many do you want? -I just need two. The 10 of spades and the 6 of clubs. -No, you can't -I have the 10 of spades! Here. Thanks! -No, you can't do that. -Don't need them. I'm going for fours. Oh, you're You're going for fours. Chandler, could you? Thanks, man. Here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and crudites. What are you doing? In poker, there's no food with more than one syllable. It's got to be like chips or dip or pretz I hope you'll let it slide just this once. I was all out of ""pretz."" Now the dealer We got it. Let's play for real. High stakes. Big bucks! You sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy. But I'm ready. So just deal. Okay, last-minute lesson! Joey.... Three. Eight. Eight. Three. All right, very good. Damn it, damn it, damn it! Joey had two fives showing, so for you to raise was Yes? Downright gutsy. -I see, so you were lying. -About what? -About how good your cards were. -I was bluffing. And what is bluffing? Is it not another word for lying? Sorry to break up this party, but I've got to go fax resumes before work. -We've got to settle. -Settle what? The Jamestown colony of Virginia. See, King George is giving us the land.... -The game, Rachel. You owe us money. -Right. It's their first time. Let's forget about the money. Hell, no. We'll pay! Monica, I had another answer all ready. And you know what? We want a rematch. That's fine with me. Could use some money. -You're enjoying this, aren't you? -Well, yeah, I am. So you get your ya-yas by taking money from your friends. Yes, and I get my ya-yas from KEA. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost less. Look, this is poker. I play to win. For me to win, others have to lose. If you're gonna play, don't expect me to be nice. Because once those cards are dealt.... Yeah? I'm not a nice guy. All right, let's eat. Did you get that from the ""I Love Rachel Pizzeria""? -You still on that? -What was with that Black Bart speech? ""When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy."" You're way off. No, I don't think so, because I think you love her! No. I might have had feelings for her at one time. Not anymore. I just Marcel! Where are you going with that disk? You are not putting that on again. If you press that button, you are in very big trouble. You believe what a jerk Ross was being? -Yeah, I know. -He can get really competitive. What? ""Hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black!"" Please! I'm not as bad as Ross. I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident? That wasn't an incident. I was gesturing and the plate slipped out of my hand. -I got an interview! -You're kidding! Where? Saks Fifth Avenue. Oh, Rachel! It's like the mother ship is calling you home. -What's the job? -Assistant buyer. I would be shopping! For a living! That's Aunt lris. She's been playing poker since she was 5. You've got to listen to every word she says. -ls Tony Randall dead? -I don't think so. -He may be now. I hit him with my car. -My God, really? No, that's bluffing. Lesson number one. Let me tell you something. Everything you hear at a poker game is pure crap! -Nice earrings. -Thank you. -Girls, sit down. -Aunt lris, this is Phoebe and Rachel. Listen, I'm parked at a meter. Let's do it. Okay? We'll start with five-card draw. Then we'll go into the studs and the hold 'ems. I talked to Cousin Nathan. Don't touch the cards when somebody is dealing. How is Nathan? Now he thinks he's a man in a woman's body. Don't you mean a woman in a man's body? It should be so simple. Ross, could we please listen to anything else? All right. I'm gonna pay for that tonight. Hi. Guys, guess what? The fifth dentist caved, and now they're all recommending Trident? No, the interview! Unbelievable! She absolutely loved me. We talked for over two hours. We've the same taste in clothes. And I went to camp with her cousin. -The job is perfect! I can do this. -That's great! -Then she told a funny story. -Great, tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker! Listen, we talked about it and if you don't wanna play, it's okay. Yes, we can play some other game. Like Pictionary? Very funny. -But we'd like to try poker again. -Yes, I think we should. -Do you want me to shuffle those? -That's okay, I'm gonna give it a go. So Pheebs owes $7. 50. Monica owes $10.00. And Rachel, you owe 1 5 big ones! Thanks for teaching us Cross-Eyed Mary. We gotta play that other way. All right, here's my $7.50. But this money is cursed. -What? -I cursed it! Now bad things will happen to the spender. I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way, I can split them up with a movie. So that just leaves the big Greene poker machine, who owes 1 5. Could you be any smugger? Let's see. Rach, I'm opening up a new art gallery... ...and I could sure use the portraits of Lincoln and Hamilton. It's so typical. ""I'm a man! I have a penis! I have to win money to exert my power over women!"" This isn't over. We'll play you again. We'll win. You'll lose. You'll beg. We'll laugh. We'll take every last dime you have. And you'll hate yourselves forever! Kind of stepped on my point there, Mon. I can't believe you lost! How much did they take? Like 30 bucks. -I'll give you that money back. -Really? No, I'm bluffing! You guys haven't learned crap! -Hand me the cards! -Can l? Yes! Wanna give us your money now? We can skip the formality of really playing. No, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh, monkey boy. Done with chitchat? Ready for serious poker? You guys, look! The one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go. Right. Serious poker. -Mon, got any more of those salmon? -You want to eat or play poker? -Where are you going? -To the bathroom. Want to go to the bathroom or play poker? Go to the bathroom. -Well, I'm gonna order a pizza. -No! I'm waiting to hear from that job. The store closes at 9:00. Eat then. That's fine. I'll just have a Tic Tac to hold me over. All right. Cincinnati. No blinds. Everybody, ante. Yes! Or no. -All right! Your money's mine, Greene. -Your fly's open, Geller. You know what I just realized? Joker is poker with a ""J""! Coincidence? That's jo-incidence with a ""C""! -Phoebe? -Yeah, I'm out. -I'm in. -Me too. Me too. What do you got? You better hop out of the shower, because I got a flush. Well, well, well! Hop back in, bucko, because I got four sixes! I got four sixes! I won! I actually won! Oh, my God! You know what? I'll make a little Ross pile. Look! I think that one was Ross'. And I think that one was Ross'. Well, I have got your money And you'll never see it And your fly's still open I made you look -I'm in. -I couldn't be in-er. Monica, in or out? I hate this game! Joey, your bet. I fold like a hooker who got hit in the stomach... ... by a fat guy with sores on his face. I'm out. -Ross? -I'm very in. -Chandler? -Couldn't be more out. Me too. Rachel? I will see you and I'll raise you. Do you wanna waste another buck? No, not this time. What did you have? -I'm not telling. -Show them. -No. -Show them! -Get your hands out of there! -I've had dates like this. Boy, you really can't stand to lose, can you? Your whole face is getting red. Veins popping out of your temple! Plus, that shirt doesn't really match those pants. -I'm not losing. -You're definitely losing. Hello. Rachel Greene. Excuse me. It's about the job! Barbara, hi! How are you? No, I understand. Come on. No, I'm fine. Don't be silly. Yeah. But if anything else opens up, please Hello? Sorry, Rach. There's gonna be lots of other stuff. Okay. Where were we? Five-card draw. Jacks are better. Nothing wild. Everybody, ante. -Look, Rach, we don't have to do this. -Yes, we do. -All right. Check. -Check. -I'm in for 50 cents. -Call. I'm in. I see your 50 cents... ...and I raise you $5. I thought it was a 50-cent limit. I just lost a job, I'd like to raise it $5. Does anyone have a problem with that? -Not at all. -No. Loser? -No, I fold. -What do you mean, you fold? I thought that, ""Once the cards are dealt, I'm not a nice guy."" Were you just full of it? I'm in. -How many do you want? -One. Dealer takes two. -What do you bet? -I bet $2. Okay. I see your $2... ...and I raise you... ... 20. I see your $20... ... raise you $25.

You got me. -That's tough to beat. -I thought we had it! When you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards. But look how happy she is. -Airmail. -Airplane. Airport. Airport '75! Airport '77!

I mean, I gave Barry up, right? I should be happy for them. I am. I'm happy for them. -Really? -No. I guess it would be different if I were with somebody. Whoa, what.... What happened to ""Forget relationships! I'm done with men!"" The whole penis embargo? I don't know. It's not about no guys. It's about the right guy. With Barry it was safe and easy, but there was no heat. With Paolo, all there was, was heat. -lt was this raw, animal, sexual -Right. I got it. I was there. Do you think you can have both? Someone who's your best friend but also can make your toes curl. Yes. Yes, I do. I really do. In fact, it's funny.

I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with guns and bombs... ...and buses going really fast! I don't need violence in a movie... ...as long as there's a little nudity. -There was nudity. -I meant female nudity. I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking. Hugh! Hugh Grant!

""Tonight"" tonight? It's perfect. It'll just be the two of us. She spent all day taking care of my monkey. I can't remember the last time a girl took care of my monkey. Anyway, I figured after work, I'd pick up some wine... ...go over there and try to woo her. Know what you should do? Take her back to the 1 890s when that phrase was last used. If you keep this up, you'll be finished by the weekend. The one in the feathered boa is Dr. Francis. Now, she used to be a man. Look, there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying. And then What? Marcel! Are you playing with Monica's shoes? You're not supposed to Marcel, did you poo in the shoe? Oh, Marcel! Bad monkey! Oh, God! Sorry, Barry. A little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that. Who died? Who died? Roll him over! Come on, roll him over! Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right, Marcel? Because Marcel? -How could you lose him? -I don't know! We were watching TV, he pooped in Monica's shoe.... Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one? I don't know. The left one! Which ones? Those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything. Why is the air in here so negative? Rachel lost Marcel. Oh, no! How? -He pooped in my shoe. -Which one? The cute black ones I always wear. No, which one? The right or left? Because the left one is lucky. Come on! What am I gonna do? All right. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go? It's his first time out, so he'll do touristy things. I'll go to Cats. You go to the Russian Tea Room. Oh, my God! Come on, you guys! He'll be home any minute. He's gonna kill me! Search the building. Take the first floor. We'll take the rest. What am I gonna do? You stay here and wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in my shoe and wait for Ross to kill you. Does anybody want to trade? What do you want? Mr. Heckles, have you seen a monkey? I left a Belgian waffle out here. Did you take it? -Why'd you leave it in the hall? -I wasn't ready for it. Have you seen a monkey? I saw Regis Philbin once. Thank you, Mr. Heckles. You owe me a waffle. He's a black capuchin monkey with a white face... ...with Russian dressing and pickles on the side. Thanks. How did it go today? Oh, great! It went great. Really great. Is that wine? You want some? Oh, I would love some. But let's not drink it here. I'm feeling crazy. You wanna go to Newark? Okay, but before we head off to the murder capital of the Northeast... ... I kind of wanted to run something by you. You know how we were talking before... ...about relationships, and stuff. -Oh, God, Ross, I cannot do this! -Okay, quick and painful. Oh, God! Okay, all right. All right, okay. Please don't hate me. What? You know Marcel? I kind of lost him. I can't believe this. All I asked you to do was keep him in here! I know. I'm sorry. It's partially my fault. I shouldn't have had you start with a monkey. You should have started with a pencil. I'm doing everything I can. Everyone's looking for him and I got -Who is it? -Animal Control. -I've even got Animal Control. -You called Animal Control? Why? Do you not like them? Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him. If they find him, they'll take him away. Well, now, see, you never ever told us that. Because I never expected you to invite them to the apartment! Thanks for coming. Somebody called about a monkey? You know, that was a complete misunderstanding. We thought we had a monkey, but we didn't. -Turned out it was a hat. -Cat! We checked, no one's seen Marcel. -My uncle Marcel. -ls that who the monkey's named after? Possession of an illegal exotic is punishable... ... by two years in prison and confiscation of the animal. Oh, my God! You'd put that poor little creature in jail? Remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first? Yes, but there isn't always time. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this. Have a seat. We haven't met. I'm Monica Geller. Oh, my God, you are! And you're Rachel Greene! Luisa Gianetti! Lincoln High? I sat behind you guys in homeroom. Luisa! Oh, my God! Monica! It's Luisa! I went there too! Luisa! From homeroom! You have no idea who I am, do you? -No. -Not at all. Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me. Would it have been hard to say, ""Morning, Luisa""... ...or ""Nice overalls""? Oh, I'm so sorry! It's not so much you. You were fat. You had your own problems. But you. What a bitch! What? You know what? Be that as it may... ...could you help us with the monkey thing, for old times'sake? Go, Bobcats! I could. But I won't. If I find that monkey, he's mine. Sorry. Marcel? Marcel? Hi, can I help you? We're having an emergency, and we were looking for something. -A monkey. -Yes, have you seen any? No, I haven't seen a monkey. Can you fix radiators? Sure! Did you try turning the knob back the other way? -Of course! -Oh. Then, no. -Taste this. Is there too much rum? -Just a second. -Hope you find your monkey. -No, wait! We may not know about radiators... ... but we do have expertise in the heating and cooling milieu. Aren't we in the middle of something? But these women are very hot, and they need our help. And they're very hot! We can't, all right? We're sorry. You don't know how sorry. We promised to find this monkey. He's this high and answers to the name Marcel. So if we could get pictures of you, it'd help us out. From now on, you don't get to talk to other people. -Oh, my God! -What? Something brushed up against my right leg. Oh, it's okay. It was just my left leg. Look, Phoebe! Oh, Marcel! Come here! Step aside, ladies. -What are you gonna do? -Just a tranquilizer. Run, Marcel, run! Damn! -Are you okay? -I think so. Oh, gosh! We've been all over the neighborhood! He's just gone! -You don't know that. -It's cold, it's dark. He doesn't know the Village! And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey and a broken foot! Thank you very much! I've said I'm sorry a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? I'll break it right now. Oh, my God! There, are you happy now? Yeah, now that you kicked the sign... ... I don't miss Marcel anymore! It's not like I did this on purpose. No, this is just vintage Rachel. Things just sort of happen around you! You're off in ""Rachel Land,"" doing your ""Rachel Thing""... ...oblivious to people's monkeys or to people's feelings and I don't want to hear it! Forget it, okay? What? Hey, banana man! This is so intense! One side of my butt is totally asleep and the other side has no idea. -What's with Phoebe? -Tranquilizer dart. Hi! Did you order some bananas? -What about it? -Give me my monkey back! -I don't have a monkey. -Then what's with the bananas? Potassium. Okay, where is he? You're wasting your time. What? -What have you done to him? -That's my monkey. That's Patty. Are you insane? Come here, Marcel. Come here, Patty. Come here, Marcel. Come here, Patty. Here, monkey. Here, monkey! Gotcha! -Give me my monkey back! -It's mine. Take this up with the judge. That's not my monkey. The dress is mine. Send it back whenever. All right, I want my monkey! -Oh, come on, Luisa. -Sorry, prom queen. You had to be a bitch in school, instead of fat. In high school, I was prom queen... ...and the homecoming queen and you... ...were also there. But this isn't high school. We're all adults here! Heckles! Can I have this? For the most part. If you take this monkey, I'll lose an important person in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. You have a chance to be the bigger person here. Take it! No. All right. Then I'll call your supervisor and tell her... ...you shot my friend with a dart! It'll be nice to get this off, won't it? Or we can leave it on. That's fine. With the right pumps, that would be a great little outfit. Listen, I'm sorry I was so hard on you before No, it was my fault. I almost lost your Yeah, but you got him back. You were great. We still have that bottle of wine. Are you in the mood for something grape? -Sure, that would be good. -All right. The neighbors must be vacuuming. Well, as long as we're here... ...and not on the subject.... I was thinking about... ... how mad we got at each other before. And maybe it was partially because of how we -Rachel? -Barry? I can't do it. I can't marry Mindy. I think I'm still in love with you. We have got to start locking that door! Show us! Come on! -lt was such a long time ago. -Okay, fine. All right. This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids? That's because I'm in front of them. Big nun! I thought that was an alp. High school wasn't my favorite time. I loved high school. It was four years of parties, dating and sex and Well, I went to boarding school with 400 boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice. Doesn't it seem like a million years ago?

120,"I can't believe you'd actually say that. I'd much rather be Mr. Peanut than Mr. Salty. No way. Mr. Salty is a sailor. He's gotta be the toughest snack there is. I don't know. You don't wanna mess with Cornnuts. They're crazy. Oh, my God. You gotta come see this. There's some creep out there with a telescope. I can't believe it. He's looking right at us. Oh, that is so sick. I feel violated. And not in a good way. How can people do that? You guys, look. Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots. The One With the Evil Orthodontist Years from now, school children will study it... ...as one of the greatest first dates ever. -Yeah. -I'll say, yeah. It was unbelievable. We could be ourselves. We didn't have to play games. -Have you called her? -She'd know I like her. That's crazy. Guys. It's gross. It's the next day. How needy do I wanna seem? -I'm right. Right? -Yeah, let her dangle. I can't believe my parents are pushing me to find one of you people. Come on. Just do it. Call her. Stop being so testosterone-y. Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. -Her machine. -Answering machine? No, interestingly, her leaf blower picked up. So, why didn't you say anything? No. Last time I left a spontaneous message... ... I ended up using the phrase, ""Yes, indeed-io."" Look, it's Rachel and Barry. Don't everybody look. What's going on? -They're just talking. -Does he look upset? Does he look like he was told to shove anything? No. Actually, he's smiling. Oh, my God. Don't do that. What? What? What? That man across the street just kicked that pigeon. And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law. See? Hey, Rach. How'd it go? You know, it was actually really great. Lunch at the Russian Tea Room. I had that chicken, where you poke it and butter squirts out. Not a good day for birds. Then we went to Bendel's. And I told him not to, but he got me a bottle of Chanel. That's nice. Now was that before or after you told him... ...to stop calling, stop sending flowers and to leave you alone? Right. Well, we never actually got to that. It was just so nice to see him again. It was comfortable and it was familiar. It was just nice. That's nice twice. Isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar? Where have you been? It was different with him today. He wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy. I mean, we had fun. Is there anything wrong with that? -Why? -I have my reasons. He's engaged to another woman... ...who happens to be your ex-best friend? All right. I know it's stupid. I'll see him this afternoon and put an end to it. I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that. No, it wasn't. It was so nice having this little sink here. Then with authority, hang up. Will you just leave her the message? Okay. All right, fine. ""Oh, Danielle, I wasn't expecting the machine. Give me a call when you get a chance. Bye-bye. Oh, God. That's what you've been working on for two hours? Hey, I've been honing. -What was with the dishes? -She might think I'm in a restaurant. I might have a life. Like I haven't been sitting here... ... honing for the last two hours? -The telescope guy's doing it again. -Oh, my God. Go away. Stop looking in here. Great. Now he's waving back. We gotta do something. I caught him looking into our place. I feel like I can't do stuff. What kind of stuff? Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff... ...but, like, when I'm cooking naked. You cook naked? Yeah, toast, oatmeal. Nothing that spatters. What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that. What's the matter? I just Oh, Barry, this was not good. No, it was. It was very, very good. -What about Mindy? -Way better than Mindy. I mean, what about you and Mindy? If you want, I'll break it off with her. No, don't do that. Not for me. Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment. Thanks, Bernice. Let's go away this weekend. -This is all way too -No, we can go to Aruba. When I went there on what would've been our honeymoon... ...it was really nice. You would've liked it. I had a bra. Hey, Dr. Farber. All right, Miss Greene, everything looks fine. We're starting to see some real progress. -What? -I'm 1 2, I'm not stupid. Can I use your phone? For future reference, that thing in your hand... ...can also be used as a phone. Yes, it's working. -Why isn't she calling? -Maybe she never got your message. Call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps... ...that means she didn't get her messages yet. -Doesn't that make me seem? -Desperate? Needy? Pathetic? You obviously saw my personal ad. How many beeps? She answered. This is where you'd use that ""hello"" word. I won't talk to her. She got my message... ...and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy. So how'd he take it? Pretty well, actually. How come you have dental floss in your hair? Oh, do l? -We ended up having sex in his chair. -You had sex in his chair? I said that a little too loudly, didn't l? You had what? Sex in his chair. What...? What were you thinking? I don't know. We still care about each other. There's a history there. It's like you and Carol. It's nothing like me and Carol. If she said to you, ""Ross, I want you on this couch... ... right here, right now,"" what would you say? If it helps, I could slide over. It's a totally different situation. It's apples and oranges. It's orthodontists and lesbians I gotta go. -Where are you going? -I just have to go. I have things to do with my life. I have a jam-packed schedule. And I am late for keeping up with it, okay? Mindy. How are you? Yes, I heard. Congratulations. That is so great. Really, oh, God I'm working tomorrow, but if you want, you can come by if you'd like. Great. Great. So I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. Bye. Oh, God. Oh, God. So how's Mindy? She wants to see me tomorrow. She sounded weird. I gotta call Barry. It's me. I just Mindy. Mindy. No, I figured that's where you'd be. Hell is filled with people like you. He's back. The peeper's back. -Get down. -Get down? And boogie. I gotta go and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy. She may not even know. I haven't heard from her in seven months, what else is it about? She was my best friend. We went to camp together, she taught me how to kiss.... Now, you know, I'm, like, the other woman. -I feel so -Naughty. -See you later. -I'll walk with you. When she taught you to kiss, were you wearing any kind of little uniform? That's fine, yeah. I'm going to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone? -Take it with you. -We haven't had a second date... -...she needs to hear me pee? -Why don't you call her? I can't. I left a message. I have some pride. -Do you? -No. Danielle, hi. It's Chandler. I'm fine. Listen.... I don't know if you tried to call me because... ... I accidentally shut off my phone. That's fine. That's great. Okay. She's on the other line. She's gonna call me back. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back. -Don't you have to pee? -That's why I'm dancing. -Mindy. -Hey, you. Hey, you. So what's up? We should really be sitting for this. Sure we should. I'm gonna ask once, and I want a straight answer. Not like when I asked if those red pants made my ass look big. I know things have been weird... ...but you're my oldest friend, except for Laurie... ...who's bitter because she lost weight... ...and it turns out, she doesn't have a pretty face. -Okay, I'm just gonna say it. -Okay. Will you be my maid of honor? -Of course. -That's so great. It is. It is. It is. -That's all you wanted to ask? -That's all. -What? -That's not all. -Oh, sure it is. -Oh, no, it isn't. I think Barry's seeing someone in the city. What would make you think that? Since the engagement, he's acted weird. And then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel. Really? If it'll make you feel any better... ...when Barry and I got engaged, he was weird too. Oh, God. That's what I was afraid of. What's what you were afraid of? When Barry was engaged to you, he and l... ... kind of had a little thing on the side. -What? -I know, I know. When he proposed, people said, ""He'll do to you what he did to Rachel."" And now I feel so stupid. You are so stupid. We are both so stupid. What do you mean? Smell familiar? Oh, I'm so sorry. Oh, no, me. I am so sorry. No, I am sorry. I'm sorry. Oh, my. Four letters, ""circle or hoop."" -Ring, damn it, ring. -Thanks. -You know our phone's not working? -What? I called and there was no answer. I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off. Just like you told her you did. Just pointing out the irony. I went across the street to the doorman. I got the peeper's name. Can I use the phone? Can I use your phone? The number for a Sidney Marks, please. ""Heating device."" Radiator. Five letters. ""Rdtor."" Yeah, is Sidney there? Oh, this is? Sidney's a woman. So she's a woman, so what? Yeah, so what? I live across the street, and I know about your telescope. And I don't appreciate it. Yeah, I can see you right now. Hello? If I wanna walk around in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel Thank you. That's not really the point. The point is, that Mostly free-weights, but occasionally Yeah, my neighbor. Yeah, the brunette. She said you looked pretty that day in the green dress. The green dress? Really? She said you looked like lngrid Bergman. Did she mention me? She wants to know why you tie the towel around your head. It's a leave-in conditioner, okay? It's a leave-in conditioner. -You got a second? -Sure, sure. Come on... -...in. -Hello, sweetheart. What you guys doing here? We are here to break up with you. Both of you? We think you're a horrible person, and bad things should happen to you. I'm sorry. God, I am so sorry. I was weak. I couldn't help myself. Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much. Which one of us are you talking to there? Mindy. Of course, Mindy. It was always Mindy. When we were having sex in that chair? I swear, whatever I was doing, I was thinking of you. Please. That second time, you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup. You did it twice? The first time didn't really count. You know, it was Barry. Honey, sweetheart, look. Just give me another chance. We'll start over. We'll go back to Aruba. What is it with you and Aruba? Do you have a deal with the airlines? What do you say? Dr. Farber, we've got an emergency here. Jason Castalano 's choking on his retainer. Oh, God. I'll be right there, Bernice. Look, please don't go anywhere. I'll be right back. Okay, and we'll be here, hating you. See how he was sweating when he walked out? If I'm hogging the ball, you jump right in there... ...and take some punches. This feels great. I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him. What are you talking about? Mindy, the guy is the devil. He is Satan in a smock. I know he's not perfect. But the truth is at the end of the day, I still really wanna be... ... Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber... ... D. D.S. Oh, God. I hope you can find a way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll still be my maid of honor. And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba. You okay? Really? Since I ran out on Barry at the wedding... ...I've wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know. I'm so glad. Big day. I'll give you this: Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. He's got the monocle, he's got the top hat.... Did you know he's gay? I just wanna clarify this. Are you outing Mr. Peanut? Danielle, hi. Everybody, this is Danielle. Danielle, everybody. Why are you here? I've been calling, but I had your number wrong. When I got the right one, there was no answer. So I thought I'd come down here and make sure you were okay. I'm okay. Maybe we could get together later? That sounds good. I'll call you. Or you call me, whatever. You got it. -Bye, everybody. -Bye. -There you go. -Second date. I don't know. You don't know? She seems nice, but her coming all the way here... ...just to see if I was okay?

I said I'll take it. Here, take it. Go. Run. Very sweet. -And on what they pay you -Career. You don't have to worry about me. I'm doing fine. I'm afraid this has been denied. That's impossible. That's all right, dear. Here you go. The One With The Fake Monica How'd someone get your card number? No idea. Look how much they spent. You only have to pay for the stuff you bought. Still, it's just such reckless spending. When somebody steals... ...they've already thrown caution to the wind. Wow, what a geek. They spent $69. 95 on a Wonder Mop. That's me. You see, when I say geek, I mean The hell with it, you bought a $70 mop, you're a geek. Oh, yuck. Ross, he's doing it again. Marcel, stop humping the lamp. Stop humping. Now, Marcel, come Come here, Marcel. Oh, no. Not in my room. I'll get him. You've got to do something about that. What? It's just a phase. Well, that's what we said about Joey. You'd think you would be more understanding. I know. But we're not. Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal. -Marcel, stop it. Marcel. Bad monkey. -What? Let's say my Curious George is no longer curious. You are not still going over that thing. -This woman's living my life. -What? She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me. Look at this. Look. She buys tickets to plays I wanna see. She shops where I'm afraid of the salespeople. -She spent $300 on art supplies. -You're not an artist. I might be if I had the supplies. I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't. Oh, Monica, come on. You do cool things. Really? Let's compare, shall we? Oh, it's so late for ""shall we."" Do I horseback ride in the park? -Do I take classes at the New School? -No. She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother. -How about Joey Paponi? -No, still too ethnic. -My agent wants a more neutral name. -Joey Switzerland? Plus, I think it should be Joe. Joey makes me sound like I'm this big: Which I'm not. Joe, Joe, Joe Stalin? Stalin. Do I know that name? It sounds familiar. Well, it does not ring a bell with me. But you're more plugged into that show business thing. Joe Stalin. You know, that's pretty good. You might wanna try Joseph. Joseph Stalin. -I think you'd remember that. -Yes. Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof. Hi. Yes, this is Monica Geller. I'm taking some classes with you, and I was wondering what they were. I've had a recent head injury and certain numbers Barbecue. Oh, did l? See, there you go. -What are you doing? -All right, great. Great. Thanks a lot. I'm going to tap class. To dance with the woman that stole your card? To see what she looks like. I'm sure her picture's up at the post office. I should get to see who she is. You're kind of losing it here. This is becoming a weird obsession. This is madness, I tell you. For the love of God, Monica, don't do it. Thank you. -What do you think? -Lots of things. -Which one is she? -May I help you? No, thanks. We're just here to observe. You don't observe a dance class. You dance a dance class. Spare shoes are over there. What does she mean? I think she means ""You dance a dance class."" -Come on, come on, come on. -Really? Do you see anybody you think could be me? Last time there were yogurt containers lying around after class. -Let's not have that happen again. -She could be you. Let's get started. Five, six. Five, six, seven, eight. -Okay, I'm not getting this. -I'm totally getting it. Do you ever feel like you're so uncoordinated? What? You click when they click. All right, everyone grab a partner. All right. And my dead mother said you are it. I'm with Rachel. Great, it's gym class all over again. You can come up to the front and dance with me. Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare? It's okay, it's okay. I'm here, I'm here. I'm so sorry I'm late. Okay, here I am. So who's the new tense girl? -She's your partner. -Hi, I'm Monica. Oh, Monica. Hi, I'm Mon -Nana. -Monana. -It's Dutch. -You're kidding. I spent three years in Amsterdam. Pennsylvania Dutch. And we're dancing. Five, six, seven, eight. Hi. -Hey. Where have you been? -I just got back from the vet. She's not gonna make you wear a big plastic cone? She says Marcel's humping is not a phase. Apparently, he's reached sexual maturity. Hey, he beat you. She says, as time goes on, he's gonna start getting violent. So, what does this mean? I have to give him up. I can't believe it. This sucks. You just got him. How could he be an adult already? I know. One day he's this little thing... ...and then he's this little thing I can't get off my leg. Isn't there any way to keep him? No. The vet said unless he's in a place... ...where he has regular access... ...to some monkey loving... ... he's just gonna get vicious. I just gotta get him into a zoo. -How do you get a monkey into a zoo? -I know. No, that's popes into a Vokswagen. We're applying to a lot. Our first choice would be a big state zoo. You know, like San Diego. Right? But that may just be a pipe dream. He's out-of-state. My vet knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility. But that's two blocks from the beach. It's a total party zoo. We found the girl. -Did you call the cops? -We took her to lunch. Oh, your own brand of vigilante justice. Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer. After you're with this woman for 10 minutes, you forget that. I mean, she's this astounding person with this amazing spirit. Which she probably stole from some cheerleader. -Take off their hats. -Popes in a Vokswagen. I love that joke. -No way. No way did you do this. -Monana was very brave. We told them we were the Gundersons in room 61 5... ...only to find out the Boston Celtics had the entire floor. When they saw that we're short and have breasts.... They threw us out. I was thrown out of a hotel. Me. Go, Monana. You ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up. Oh, by the way... ...tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show. -Excuse me? -There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we sing ""Memories""... ...and make complete fools of ourselves. What do you say? No, no, no. Remember who you're dealing with here. I can't even stand in front of a tap class. That's because of your Amish background. -What? -You're Pennsylvania Dutch, right? Right. Till I bought a blow dryer. Then I was shunned. I was just like you. And then, one day, I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets Society? I thought that movie was so incredibly boring. That thing at the end where the kid... ...kills himself because he can't be in the play? It's like, ""Kid, wait a year. Leave home, do some community theater."" I thought, ""That's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back."" That scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do. Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire. Oh, God. We didn't get into Scranton. That was, like, our safety zoo. They take, like, dogs and cows. See, I don't know who this is harder on, me or him. I'd say that chair's taking the brunt of it. Marcel. Marcel. Marcel, no. Good boy. See? How can nobody want him? Somebody will. You know, there already is a Joseph Stalin. You're kidding. Apparently, he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered people. -You'd think you would've known that. -You'd think I would've. Hey, how about Joey Heatherton? Come on, I told you I don't wanna go back to Joey. What do you think a good stage name for me would be? Flame Boy. Where exactly is your zoo? Well, it's technically not a zoo, per se. It's more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about Marcel. -Does he fight with other animals? -No, no. He's very docile. Even if he were cornered? Well, I don't know. Why? How is he at handling small objects? He can hold a banana, if that's what you mean. What about a hammer or a small blade? Why would he need a blade? If he's up against an animal with horns... ...you got to give him something. Otherwise, it's just cruel. -He got into San Diego. -What? We came back from our walk. The phone was ringing.... He's in. Did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego. You're making a mistake. San Diego's good... ... but I'll start him off against a blind rabbit... ...and give you 20% of the gate. Where have you been? Monica and I just crashed an embassy party. I think I kissed an archbishop. But, of course, it could've been a chef. -Are you drunk? -No. -I'm lying. I am so drunk. -Oh, God. You know what? You could've called. I've been worried Monica. Water rules. Yes. Yes, it does. The restaurant called. They wanna know if you're showing up for work. Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today. You're gonna lose your job. This is not you. No, it is me. I'm not just the person who fluffs the pillows... ...and pays the bills right away. You know, when I'm with her, I'm so much more than that. I'm Monana. Hello? Yes, she is. Hold on a second please. Monana, it's for you. The credit card people. Hello. Yes? Oh, my God. -Thanks. -What? They've arrested Monica. -Hi. -Hi. How are you? Not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my color. How did you know I was here? Because I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using. That I was not expecting. I want you to know, I didn't turn you in. -Thanks. -No, thank you. You have given me so much. I'd never have gotten to sing... ... ""Memories"" at the Winter Garden Theater. Actually, you only got to sing ""Memo"" I can't believe you're here. What will I do without you? Who's gonna crash parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus? I started my day by peeing in front of 25 other women... ...and you're worried about who'll take you to the circus? Well, not worried, you know, just wondering. There's nothing to wonder about. You'll go back to being who you were. That's who you are. -Not necessarily. -Yes, necessarily. I don't know what it is. Maybe it's the Amish thing. -I'm not actually Amish. -Really? Then why are you like that? -You, by the door, in or out? -ln. -You're getting it all wrong. -But at least I'm doing it. This is the final boarding call for Flight 67... ... to San Diego at gate 42A. Okay, goodbye, little monkey guy. All right, I wrote you this poem. Okay, but don't eat it till you get on the plane. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe. Okay, bye, champ. There'll be a lot of babes in San Diego... ... but remember, there's also a lot to learn. I don't know what to say, Ross. It's a monkey. Just say what you feel, Joey. -Marcel, I'm hungry. -That was good. Marcel, this is for you. It's just, you know, something... ...to do on the plane. If you don't mind, I'd like a moment alone. -Oh, sure. Absolutely. -Go ahead. Marcel, come here. Come here. Come here. Well, buddy... ...this is it. Just a couple of things I wanted to say. I'm really gonna miss you. You know, I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to me. You've been more like a Okay. Marcel. Would you leave my leg alone? Would you stop humping me for two seconds? Okay, would you just take him away? Just take him. Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand... ...that I might touch thy cheek. -That's fine.

Last night, I had a dream... ...that you and I were Doing it on this table. Excellent dream score. Why would you dream that? More importantly... ...was I any good? Well, you were pretty damn good. Interesting. In my dreams, I'm surprisingly inadequate. Last night, you seemed to know your way around the table. I love it when we share. You okay? I can't believe you two had sex in her dream.

She's having one of her boobs reduced.

I could do that. -What's that? -My new beeper. Why does a paleontologist need a beeper? Is it for dinosaur emergencies? Help. They're still extinct. It's for when Carol goes into labor.

I'll see that he gets the message. Bye-bye. Ross says hi. This is so fun. What do we do now? Well, now I actually have to get to work. ""Most likely."" Okay, I'm gonna be out there. All right. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. -Yes? -What you doing? Okay, windows are clean. Candles are lit. BeIt's too tight. Gotta change. Did I turn the fish? Nope, because I made lasagna. -Am I out of control? -Just a touch. I don't understand. You've been dating this guy since... ... his midterms. Why, all of a sudden, are you so...? -What? -Could tonight be the night? I don't know. He's a great guy... ...and I love being with him. But, you know... ...things happen when they happen. You don't plan these things. -So, did you shave your legs? -Yeah. Would you let it go? It was just a dream. It doesn't mean This is it. It's baby time! All right, relax. Just relax. Be cool. Yeah, hi. I was just beeped. No, Andre is not here. Third time today. Yes, I am sure. I do not perform those kind of services. Services? Oh, services. Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO. That's right. That's right. JUMBO with a ""U,"" sir. You don't want me. Judging by his number, I'd be a huge disappointment. Alrighty, bye-bye. How was the first day? Excellent. Everyone was so, so nice. It pays to know the man who wears my shoes. Me. -I didn't tell anyone I knew you. -Why? Well, because, you know. They don't like you. -What? -I thought you knew. -Who doesn't like me? -Everyone. Except for.... No. Everyone. -What are you talking about? -Don't feel bad. They used to like you a lot. But you got promoted, and now you're Mr. Boss Man. Mr. Big. Mr. Bing. Boss Man Bing. -I can't believe it. -Yeah. They even do you. They ""do"" me? You know, like, okay: ""Could that report be any later?"" -I don't sound like that. -Yeah, you do. ""The hills are alive with the sound... ...of music."" ""My scone. My scone."" I don't sound like that. That is so not true. That is so not That is so not That Oh, shut up. -Did not. -Up until I was 9... ... I thought ""gunpoint"" was a place where crimes happened. -How's that possible? -It's always on the news. ""A man is being held up at Gunpoint."" ""Tourists are terrorized at Gunpoint."" And I kept thinking, ""Why do people continue to go there?"" I should go. -Unless -What? Unless you wanna stay over. I mean, I'm going to. So.... Yeah, I'd really like that. Before we get into any staying-over stuff... ...there's something you should know. Is this, like, ""I have an early class tomorrow""... ...or ""I'm secretly married to a goat""? Well, it's somewhere in between. You see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, I'm not.... Well, I mean, I haven't ever.... Ethan? Are you a virgin? If that's what you kids are calling it these days, then... ...yes, I am. I mean, you're just such a good kisser I would never have known. Well, I've excelled at every level I've been to, I just.... I just haven't been to that particular one yet. I've kind of been waiting for the right person. -Really? -Yeah. You do know I was talking about you, right? Wow. You keep saying that. You know, you read about it. You see it in the movies. Even when you practice it at home, man, oh, man... ...it is nothing like that. Listen, listen. You told me something that was really difficult for you. And I figure if you can be honest, then I can too. Don't tell me I did it wrong. Nothing wrong about that. Here goes. I'm not 22. I'm 25... ...and 1 3 months. But I figure that shouldn't change anything. What does it matter how old we are? Basically, I'm nuts about you. I knew after the first time we kissed. You didn't mention the Tic Tac. I just thought you were naturally minty. Listen... ...as long as we're telling stuff... ... I have another one for you. I'm a little younger than I said. -You're not a senior? -Oh, I'm a senior... ...in high school. What we did was wrong. I just had sex with someone who wasn't alive during the bicentennial. I just had sex. Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me? -You never said your age. -It's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. -What were you thinking? -I was too busy falling -Don't say it. -ln love with you. -Really? -Sorry. Well, fall out of it. You shouldn't be here. It's a school night. Oh, God. I'm like those women that you see... ...with shiny guys named Chad. I'm Joan Collins. Who? Andre should be there in about 45 minutes. Yes, sir, the kimonos are extra. Alrighty. Bye-bye. It's just easier that way. -You told me about the last dream. -No. Forget it. Why not? Was I doing something particularly saucy? All right. Fine. You were not the only one there. Joey was there too. All right. Was there... ...anybody else there? You sure? Nobody... ... handing out mints or anything? No, it was just the three of us. So was it you and Chandler... ...then you and me, or you, me and Chandler? -You know what? -What? There were times... ...when it wasn't even me. That is so sweet, you guys. Mon, Ethan called again. -What? -Ethan called again. -You're not seeing him anymore? -No. Sometimes, things don't work out. This has nothing to do with him needing a note to get out of gym? I did not say anything. I swear. -He stopped by. -Next time you talk to him... ...could you ask him which one the strongest Power Ranger is? Oh, my life is just so amusing. Can we drop it now? Sorry. ""It's morphin'time."" -Stegosaurus. -Tyrannosaurus. I gotta go. Head rush. One more, and then I have to go. Cool. Where you going? A birthday party with some work people. Work people? Nobody told me. I know. That's part of the whole... ...them-not-liking-you extravaganza. A month ago, these people were my friends. I'm in charge, but I'm not a different person. Then come, hang out. Let them see what a great guy you still are. -You think I should? -I really do. But could we not go together? I don't wanna be the geek who invited the boss. -Hey, you okay? -Yeah. -This can't be easy for him either. -I know. This may take some time for him to get over it... ... but, then at four, Muppet Babies is on. Go deep. Deep. Deep. Sorry, Shelly. See, with the fun? Last night was great. The karaoke thing? Tracy and I doing ""Ebony and lvory."" You were great. But they still made fun of you. -What? -Now you're Mr. Caring Boss. Mr. I'm-one-of-you Boss. Mr. I-wanna-be-your-buddy Boss Man Bing. Then I don't get it. You know what? I think you just gotta face it. You're the guy in the big office. You're the one that hires and fires them. -They say you're a great boss. -They do? But they're not your friends anymore. -I just want -But you can't. But I just want Are you gonna? Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 9-1 -1... ...she's having a baby. Otherwise, I just ignore it. What about Andre? He got a call from our cousin, Nathan. Frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know. That was gonna be my opener. Have you guys seen those new hand dryers in the bathroom? -I thought that was just a rumor. -True story. Look, I gotta tell you something. I'm not 1 7. I said that so you'd think I was vulnerable. I'm actually 30. I have a wife and a job. I'm your congressman. This is ridiculous. We're great together. We can talk, make each other laugh, and the sex.... I have no frame of reference, but I thought that was great. -lt was. -Then what's the problem? Ethan, it's.... It's icky. ""lcky""? You're actually gonna throw this away because it's ""icky""? This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different. If you were older or I was younger... ...or we lived in biblical times... -... I could really -No, don't say it. Love you. -Are your hands still wet? -Moist. Let's dry them again. Or, like, ""Could these margaritas be any stronger?"" Hey, Chandler. Hello, Mr. Bing. Loved your Stevie Wonder last night. Thanks. About the weekly numbers, I'm gonna need them on my desk by 9:00. -Sure. -No problem. You have to give them something. That was Gerston, Santos, and who's the other guy? -Petrie. -Petrie. Right, okay. Well, some people are gonna be working... ...this weekend. Oh, that's nice. Ross. I'm here. You are? We were just.... What? -Great. Now I'm having a baby. -What? I'm having a baby.

What'll you do when you have a baby? I'll be in the waiting room, handing out cigars. Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the '50s. She could be giving birth in the cab. Relax. It's only $2 for the first contraction... ...and then 50 cents for each additional contraction. What, it's okay when Chandler does it? You have to pick your moments. Did I miss it? -She's not here yet. -What's with the guitar? We might be here for a while. Things might get musical. -Where have you been? -We stopped at the gift shop. I got this, and Susan wanted a Chunky. You're having a baby. You don't stop for Chunkies. I used to have that bumper sticker. You see what I mean? The One With the Birth -""Stopped for a Chunky."" -Let it go, Ross. I got an extra one. You want this? -How's my favorite parenting team? -Dr. Franzblau. I understand you're thinking of having a baby. I see you're nine months pregnant. That's a good start. -How are your contractions? -I love them. Each one's like a little party in my uterus. -Every 4 minutes, lasting 55 seconds. -59 seconds. Quartz. Swiss quartz. -Am I allowed to drink anything? -lce chips. -At the nurse's station. -I'll get it! -No, I'll get it. -No, I'm getting it. Hi.

Let's get some coffee. -Okay, because we never do that. Shoot, shoot, shoot. Or just fall down. That's good too. Knick fan? -Oh, boy, do they suck. -Listen, lady Look. Look at your man, Ewing.

What is it? Is there something unmarriable about me? Well? Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack. Look at you, dressy-dress. Did you go home and change? It's an important day. I want to look nice. Has Dr. Franzblau been by? I haven't seen him. Where is he? He is supposed to be here. What if the baby needs him? What's the deal with you and doctors? Is your father a doctor? Yeah. Why? No reason. Mom, we've been through this. No, I am not calling him. I don't care if it is his kid, the guy's a jerk. No, I am not alone. Joey's here. What do you mean ""Joey who""?

She's not much of a phone person. So, what's the deal with this father guy? If someone was having my baby, I'd wanna know about it. Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? No. -Maybe I should just go. -Maybe you should. Good luck... ...and take care. The Celtics problem is that the players run the team. -That is so not true. -Oh, it is. -Breathe. -Breathe.

I want both of you out. -She started it. -He did. I'm trying to get a person out of my body here... ...and you're not making it any easier! Now go! -Thanks. -See what you did? -Listen -Out! Breathe. Breathe. What is that? Something exploded. -That's not the baby, is it? -Her water broke. Calm down. Water breaking? What do you mean? What's that? Breathe. Breathe. I'm okay. I'm okay. That's disgusting. I'm okay. -This is so your fault. -How is this my fault? Carol never threw me out of a room before you. There's a lot of things Carol never did before me. -Are you trying to be clever? -You're so threatened by me. Hey. Okay, all right. That's it. Get in here. My God, you guys. I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world here... ...and your fighting isn't the first thing they should hear. So stop all the yelling! Just stop it! Don't make me do this again! I don't like my voice like this! Who wants to hear something ironic? Are they here yet? Don't worry, we're gonna find them. And until we do, we are all here for you. Okay? You were telling me about Paris. It sounds wonderful. There was this great little pastry shop right by my hotel There you go, dear. -You find them? -Not in the gift shop or cafeteria.... Where are Phoebe and Joey? There's something sinister going on here. If you find anyone, or parts of anyone... ...scream. And scream again. -Help! -Come on! -I'm having a baby in there! -Hello!

No, you don't have to fly back. Really. What do you mean ""This might be your only chance""? I'm only 26. I'm not even thinking about babies yet. -Where have you been? -I just had a baby. Mazel tov. It could be one hour or three. But relax. She's doing great. So tell me, are you currently involved with anyone? Not at the moment, I'm not. Are you? No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me. Right. Yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors. No, really. I suppose it's because I spend so much time, you know... ...where I do. I try not to let work affect my personal life. But it's hard when, when you do what I do. It's, like.... Well, for instance, what do you do? I'm a waitress. Aren't there times when you come home at night and you're, like: ""If I see one more cup of coffee...."" Gotcha. -I'm gonna check up on your friend. -That's fine. -How'd you know I was here? -Your mom called me. So is this her? No, this is a loaner. Ours is at the shop. God, I hope she has my brains. I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself. I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse and a helper guy. -So did you see who won the game? -The Knicks by 10. They suck. They're not so bad. Come on. Come on. -You're doing it too hard. -You have to do it hard or else Damn it. Damn it. Damn it, damn it. This is all your fault. This should be the greatest day of my life. My son is being born, and I should be in there. Instead, I'm stuck in a closet with you. I have been waiting for this as much as you. No one's been waiting for this as much as I have. You know what's funny? You go home with the baby. Where does that leave me? You're his father. Who am l? There's Father's Day. There's Mother's Day. There's no Lesbian Lover Day. Every day is Lesbian Lover Day. This is so great. Do you wanna explain that? I mean, when I was growing up, my dad left... ...and my mother died and my stepfather went to jail. I barely had enough pieces to make one whole parent. And here's this baby who has three whole parents... ...who fight over who gets to love it the most... ...and it's not even born yet. It's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. I'm sorry. You were fighting. Where are they? -They'll be here. -They wouldn't miss this. Relax. You're only at 9 centimeters, and the baby's at zero station. You are really frightening me. Somebody wanna help me? Trying to rip out my heart. That's great. Anybody seen a nipple? Ten centimeters. Here we go. -Time to start pushing. -But they're not here yet. -I can't tell the baby to wait. -Oh, God. -Okay, got the vent open. -Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben to the rescue.

Do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner? Out. Here he comes. Let me see. I've gotta see. A head. It's huge. How are you doing this? You're not helping. You're doing great. -Hello? -Oh, sorry. What do you see? What do you see? We got a head. We got arms. Oh, look at the little fingers. A chest and a stomach... ...and it's a boy, definitely a boy. Legs, knees and feet. He's here. He's a person. -Look. -What does he look like? IKind of like my Uncle Ed, covered in Jell-O. Really? You guys, he's beautiful. Thanks, Pheebs. No shouting, but we still need a name for this little guy. -How about Ben? -I like Ben. Ben. Ben's good. How come you never mentioned Ben before? We just cooked it up. That's what we were off doing. -Can we come in? -Yeah, come on. I know. I know. Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet. -This is Ben. -Hi, Ben. Ben, this is everybody.

Ross, we love him, okay? But right now he's just a little fat guy. How excited can we get? -What you got? -400 pictures of Ben on a rug. -Oh, my God! -Let me see! The One Where Rachel Finds Out Here's little Ben nodding off. Look at Aunt Monica's little boy! -Look, he's got Ross haircut. -Let me see. Oh, God! Is he just the sweetest thing?

Including the waffles last week, you now owe me... ... 1 7 jillion dollars. -Really, I'll pay you back this time. -Where's this money coming from? I'm helping out at the NYU Med School with research. What kind of research? Just, you know, science. Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that. It's a fertility study. Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time. Actually, a little more than that. Thank you, God. This will bring us so much joy. Come on, it's not that big a deal. I just go down there every other day... ...and make my contribution to the project. But at the end of two weeks, I get $700! You're gonna be making money hand over fist. That's funny. Very funny. This is great. I actually know somebody who loves what they do. But what do you do to unwind after a tough day at work? Okay, we got the coleslaw and buns. The ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys. I just love barbecuing with you. Men are here! We make fire. Cook meat. Put out fire by peeing, no get invited back. Cute. -Melanie called. She'll be late. -Okay. How are things going? Is she becoming your ""special someone""? I don't know. She's pretty great. What does she think of your little science project? You think I'd tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup? Man's got a point. The tough thing is, she really wants to have sex. Crazy bitch. I got a week left to go. According to the rules... ... I can't conduct personal experiments, if you know what I mean. Joey, we always know what you mean. How long did you think this barbecue would last? -I'm going to China. -Jeez, you say one thing, and.... -China? -For the museum. Someone found a bone. They don't want us to have it. I'm going to try to persuade them. It's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'll be gone for a week. If you want to reach me, you can't. So here's my itinerary. -Here's a picture of me. -Oh, let me see. Could you show it to Ben every now and then so he doesn't forget me? ""Hi, Ben. I'm your father."" ""I am The Head!"" This barbecue's gonna be very fun. I wanted to wish Rachel a happy birthday before I left. -She's out having drinks with Carl. -Hey, who's Carl? That guy she met at the coffeehouse. -There's this guy she met at -The coffeehouse? Right. So you do know who he is. I'll go say goodbye to the guys. Hey, you know what? Tell them that bone story. -I have to go to China. -The country? No, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you know who Carl is? Let's see. Alvin, Simon, Theodore.... No. Rachel's having drinks with him tonight. How can she, when she's never shown interest in you? -Forget about her. -He's right. Please move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food. Of course, there they just call it ""food."" Yeah, I guess. I don't know. All right, just give her this for me, okay? We're looking out for you. We want you to be happy. I may only have a couple beers in me, but I love you. I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice. That's when we started this fruit basket business. We call ourselves ""The Three Basketeers."" Like ""The Three Musketeers,"" only with fruit. -How do you want your burgers? -Presents first! We're doing presents first. Hey, hold on there, tiger. How are you holding up? Well, not so good. She thinks tonight we're gonna... ...complete the transaction, if you know what And you do. Have you ever thought about being there for her? What do you mean? You know, just be there for her. Not following you. Think about it. Okay. I'm guessing this is from.... -Thank you, Melanie. -This one right here is from me. Okay. It's light. It rattles. It's... ...Travel Scrabble! Thank you. This one's from Joey. It feels like a book, I think it's a book. And it's a book! It's Dr. Seuss! That book got me through some tough times. There's a little child inside this man. The doctors say if they remove it, he'll die. -Who's this from? -From Ross. Oh, my God! He remembered! -Remembered what? -lt was months ago. We walked by this antique store. I saw this pin. I told him it was like one my grandma had when I was little. I can't believe he remembered! Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? It's so pretty! This must've cost him a fortune. I can't believe it. Remember when he fell in love with Carol... ...and bought her that expensive crystal duck? What did you just say? Crystal duck. No, no, no. The ""love"" part? -Oh, my God! -Oh, no, no, no. That's good. Just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time. This is unbelievable. I mean, this is unbelievable! I know. This is really, really huge. No, it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee. I don't think any of our lives will ever be the same ever again. Is there a mute button on this woman? I think this is so great. I mean, you and Ross! -Did you have any idea? -No, none! My first night in the city, he mentioned asking me out... ... but nothing ever happened. What else did he say? Does he wanna go out? Given that he's in love with you... ... he wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee. Ross? All this time? I've gotta talk to him. -He's in China! -The country. Is his flight gone? Yes! He's watching a woman do this: He's gone! His flight doesn't leave for 45 minutes. -What about time difference? -From here to the airport? -You'll never make it! -I've gotta try. What'll you say to him? -I don't know. -Then you shouldn't go. Right. If you're gonna break his heart, that can wait. But if it's good, tell him now. -Maybe I'll know when I see him. -All right, does this help? No. Look, all I know is, I cannot wait a week. This is just too big. I've just gotta talk to him. Okay, I'll see you later. Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first! All right. -Ross! Excuse me, pardon me. -Your boarding pass? I need to talk to my friend. Sorry, you're not allowed here without a pass. He's right there, in the blue jacket! Can l? I'm sorry. Federal regulations! Then could you please just give him a message for me? -This is very important. -All right. What's the message? I don't know. Excuse me, sir! Excuse me, sir? I have a message for you. Rachel loved the present. She'll see you when you get back. What? Toby, I don't know what she's talking about. There's no Rachel. Don't give me that deep freeze. Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey! I think I blacked out there for a minute. It was nothing. Well, now we gotta find something fun for you. You know what? Forget about me. Let's give you another turn. -Me, again? -Sure. Why not? Boy, somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow! I gotta tell you, you are nothing like I thought you'd be. How do you mean? I had you pegged as a guy who's always, ""Me, me, me!"" But you, you're a giver. You're the most generous man I ever met. I mean, you're practically a woman. -You're just saying that. -No. A woman! -So? -I missed him. -I'm so sorry. -That's too bad. Yeah, right. No, I feel bad for her. I do. I can think of somebody other than myself. All right, I'm going to bed. -Happy birthday. Hang in there. -Thanks. Yes! Pizza coupons. Okay. You guys want help cleaning up this mess? That'd be great. So, Rach, you wanna save this wrapping paper? Are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I throw it out? I don't know. I don't know. Thought about it all the way there... ...and I thought about it all the way back. You know, it's Ross! You know what I mean? It's Ross. -Sure! -Sure. I don't know. This is just my initial gut feeling... ... but I'm thinking it'd be really great. Oh, my God, me too! We'd be like friends-in-law! The best part is you already know all about him. You start on the 1 5th date. But it would be like starting on the 1 5th date. Another good point. I mean, on the 1 5th date, you're already in a very... ... ""relationship-y"" place. You're committed. What happens if it doesn't work out? -Why isn't it working out? -Sometimes it doesn't. Is he not cute enough? Does he not make enough money? -No, I'm just -Maybe there's someone else. -ls there someone else? -No, there is no one else. Then why are you dumping my brother? Hey, big Spender! She's still asleep. -So how'd it go? -You know how you think you're great? The fact you'd even ask shows how little you know me. Last night I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got! Man, oh, man! It was like a ticker-tape parade! I know. My room's very, very close to the parade route. It was amazing, and not just for her. For me too! It's like, all of a sudden I'm blind... ... but all my other senses are heightened. It's like I was able to appreciate it... ...on another level. -I didn't know you had another level. -I know. Neither did l! Is something going on with O.J.? Hey, great skirt. Birthday present? -From who? -You. I exchanged the blouse you got me. Well, it's the thought. Doesn't Ross'flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27B? Yeah. Monica, you know, I've been thinking about it. I've decided this Ross thing is not a good idea. Why? I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I'd be going out with all of you. There'd be pressure No pressure, no pressure! Nothing has happened, and you're already so I'm not ""so."" Okay, I was a teensy bit weird at first... ... but I'll be good. I promise. -Who is it? -It's me, Carl. -Come on up. -Behind my brother's back? Is the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me. -Seven hundred bucks! -All right, you did it! Do we have any fruit? Man, hell of a two weeks. You know what? I feel I learned something. You'll stick with this ""all for her"" thing? What are you, crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this? If I see one more picture of Ed Begley Jr... ...in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I'm not against environmental issues, per se... ...it's just that guy! I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me. Excuse me, I'm trying to have a date here. Fine. Just stop thinking about me. Can't do it, can you? I'm thinking about you. So what? I don't get it. What do you see in this guy? Happens to be a very nice guy. I mean, come on, buddy! Get a real car! Rachel, come on. Give us a chance. Ross, it's too hard. Why, because it'll get weird for everyone else? This is about us. I've been in love with you since the ninth grade. You're like my best friend. If we broke up, and I lost you What makes you think that? Have you been involved where you haven't broken up? No. But it only has to happen once. You and I both know we are perfect for each other. Right? So the only question is: Are you attracted to me? I don't know. I mean, I've never looked at you that way before. Well, start looking. -Wow. -Exactly! And I'm gonna be the guy... ...caught behind this hammerhead in traffic! Right! You're right. You know what? I'm supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! If you wanna finish your drinks, please do. -I'm sorry, I gotta go. I'm sorry. -But.... -Where are you going? -To get Ross. -My God, this is so exciting! -I know. If you want the rest of my date, I'm not gonna finish it. -Rachel, he's not a sandwich. -No, he's a banker with opera tickets. Hello! -Where you going? -Airport. You can't tell him. There's so much I haven't done. I haven't watched Baywatch with Yasmine Bleeth! Chandler, relax. This is a good going to the airport. Oh, well then fly, good woman, fly like the wind. -I'm flying! -Tell him I'm the one who blew it! Yes, another successful case for the love doctor. Excuse me! Pardon me. Excuse me. Sorry. Toby, for God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel! Hey! I got that. -Thanks, sweetie. -No problem. I can't wait for you to meet my friends. You don't think they'll judge me? -No, they will. I just.... -Can't wait! Come on, they're gonna love you. <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"

Well, thanks, man. Now I can get my pony. This is a little extra something for... ...always being there for me. Wow, I don't know what to say. Wow, I don't know what to say. What do you say? I don't know. It's a bracelet. Isn't it? It's engraved, too. Check it out. ""To my best bud."" Thanks, best bud. Put it on. Now? No, it should be saved for a special occasion. No, that's the beauty part. It goes with everything. When you put this on, you're good to go. Well, I've never been good to go, so... What the hell, why not try some jewelry. Oh, man! You are so wearing that bracelet! I so am! Any idea what this will do for your sex life? It might slow down at first, but... ...once I'm used to the extra weight, I'll be back on track. The One With the Prom Video - This all looks good. - Great. If I want to call for a reference on your last job...? That's right there, see? The manager, Chandler Bing? All right. Let's see if you're as good in person as you are on paper. Make me a salad. A salad? I could do something more complicated. No, just the salad will be fine. You got it. Now I want you to tell me what you're doing while you're doing it. All right. Well, I'm tearing the lettuce. Is it dirty? Oh, I'm gonna wash it. Don't. I like it dirty. That's your call.

You gonna slice them up real nice? I was going to do them julienne. I'm out of here! Hello? Rachel's not here. Can I take a message? How do we spell Casey? Is it like ""at the bat"" or ""and The Sunshine Band""? Hey, who's this Casey? A guy she met at the movies. What does he want with her? I guess he wants to do a little dance... ...you know, make a little love... Well, get down tonight. I don't know. I don't... I don't get it! Two months ago, Rachel and I were this close. Now I'm taking messages from guys she meets at the movies? I mean, this Casey should be taking down my messages, you know? Or Rachel and I should be together... ...and we should get some kind of message service. Hang in there. It's gonna happen. Now, how do you know that? Because she's your lobster. Oh, she's going somewhere. It's a known fact that lobsters fall in love and mate for life. You know what? You can actually see old lobster couples... ...walking around their tank, holding claws, like... You have to picture lobsters. Hey, you feeling better? Yeah, I think that fifth shower got the interview off me. Do you have other possibilities? There is the possibility that I won't make rent. If you want, I can lend you money. If I couldn't pay you back right away, I'd feel guilty and tense around you. Then why not borrow it from Mom and Dad? You feel guilty and tense around them already. Might as well make some money off of them. The man's got a point. What is that sparkly thing? That thing? Yeah, it's a little flashy. No, no. No, no. It's not flashy. Not for a goodfella. Man, that is sharp! That must have cost you quite a few doubloons. No, it's fun, it's fun. It's kinda like knowing one of the Gabor Sisters. Hi, darling. What's this? Some of your old stuff. Well, sweetie, we have a surprise for you. We're turning your room into a gym. Wow, that is a surprise! Just one question. Why not Ross's room? We talked about that... ...but your brother had so many science trophies, plaques, merit badges... We didn't want to disturb them. God forbid! So what's new with you? What can you tell us? - How's your job? - My job? Well... Did I mention I still don't have a boyfriend? Well, I just assumed. We were so sorry to hear about your parents splitting up. Well, they're just separated. You never know! We'll see. I can't say any of us were surprised. They've been unhappy ever since we've known them. Especially after that incident in Hawaii. What? What incident? No, no. I must be thinking of someone else. Maybe me! Don't you have some folding to do? Fold. You fold. - Want a refill? - I'm all right, thanks. Give me a second. I want to get this just right. Dude, eleven o'clock, totally hot babe checking you out. That was really good. I think I'm ready for my penis now. I know what you're thinking. Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's. I'm Gail. I really have to go, but it was nice meeting you. Excellent! He could have gotten me a VCR or a set of golf clubs. But no! He got me the ""woman repeller""!

""I pity that fool..."" Hey, man! We were just doing some impressions. Do your Marcel Marceau. That's actually good. Would you look at that guy? How long has he been talking to her? I don't know. A couple of minutes. Yeah? Try doubling that. It's like, back off, buddy! She's a waitress, not a geisha. I think she's okay. Look at that! She pushes him away and he won't budge! I'm gonna do something. We'll get a condo... ...right on the mountain. Ski in, ski out, it's great. Excuse me? Are you Rachel? What? Ross Geller. God, in your ad you said you were pretty, but wow!

You're welcome. - What? - I was saving you. Saving me from a pleasant conversation with an interesting man? From where I was... Okay, Ross, listen to me. I am not yours to save. But you are. What? You're my lobster. Are you being the blind-date guy again? No, you're my lobster. Lobsters... In the tank, when they're old... ...they get with the... They walk around holding the claws. In the tank! You know, with... ...with the holding and... Pheebs, you wanna help me with the lobster thing? Do the claws again. Rach, forget the lobsters, okay? Let's talk... What about us? Ross, there is no ""us,"" okay? No! Listen to me! I fell for you and I get clobbered. You then fall for me and I again get clobbered. I'm tired of being clobbered, you know? It's just not worth it. Well, but... No ""but,"" Ross. We are never gonna happen, okay? Accept that. Except that what? No. No. Accept that. I gotta go. Hey, man! Look, it's my best bud! How you doing? You're getting good at that Marcel Marceau thing. What do you say we play some ball? You and me, huh? Okay, that's my bad. If you hated the bracelet, you should have just said so. Doesn't the fact that I wore it... ...say how much our friendship means to me? But you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me. Well, that's the part where I'm a wank. I was hoping you wouldn't focus on that. Oh, yeah? Well focus on this. Hard to argue with that. Come on, man! I said I was sorry a hundred times. I promise, I will never take it off my... ...wrist. But if you want to stay in there and be mad... ...you just, you stay in there. You know what the... I am here, on my knees... ...holding up these couch cushions... ...as a symbol of my sorrow and regret. Much like they did in biblical times. Though you may haveth anger now... You're gonna grab yourself again, aren't you? You know, that Steffi Graf has quite a tush. I'm just saying! It's right there! Hey, guys. Hi, darling. You didn't bring my grandson? He's at Carol and Susan's today. A woman in my office is a lesbian. I'm just saying! Jack, look! There's that house paint commercial that cracks you up! - Where have you been? - Emotional hell. Did they lend you the money? No, I haven't asked them yet. Come on, Monica, do it. Hey, you guys. Monica has some news. So listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before, but... ...I'm no longer at my job. I had to leave it. Why? Because they made me. You were fired? What are you gonna do? Judy, relax. This is our little Harmonica we're talking about. We taught her well. - Ten percent of your paycheck goes? - In the bank. So she dips into her savings. That's what it's there for. She's gonna be fine. - Aren't you, sweetie? - In the bank. If you need a little extra... ...you know where to find it. Anything larger back there? I can't believe it! Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay. Oh, you're right. I should play in the hay. I just dropped $400 to replace a bracelet I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay! Hey! I've got something that'll make you happy. Guess what Gunther found? Hey, now you have two! Oh, now you have two. What am I gonna do? How come you have two? This one's for you. Get out! No, I can't. I know how much this means to you... ...and this is about more than jewelry. It's about you and me and the fact that we're ""best buds."" Is this friendship? I think so! Check it out! We're bracelet buddies! That's what they'll call us! Okay, here you go. Pay me back whenever you like. You have dinosaur checks? You get your money and you learn something. What's wrong with that? Nothing. Hey, you're a cheap-a-saurus! I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Thank you, I'm very grateful. Hey, Mon, what is this? That's my bathing suit from high school. I was a little bigger then. I thought they used that to cover Connecticut when it rains. Hey, what's on this videotape? I don't know. Let's put it in. <i>Over here, Jack.

No running in the chapel. Hey, don't you give me any of your-- Hey! Why are you here? Ross and Rachel left a message. They're getting married. -Isn't that why you guys are here? -Yes. Why else would we be here? What happened? Did we miss it? We missed it. Maybe you wouldn't have if you could run in the chapel! This is insane. What's the big deal? It's not like it's a real marriage. What? If you marry in Vegas, you're only married in Vegas. If you marry here, you're married everywhere. Really? Yeah. Oh, my God! Oh, well. The One After Vegas English Subtitles by Gelula/SDI Why are we in bed together? I don't know. Do you have any clothes on? Yes. -Really? -No. But we didn't have. . . . . .sex, did we? I don't remember much about last night. It was such a blur. I remember laughing. I laughed a lot. Then we didn't have sex. Oh, I mean, we were really drunk. I'm glad we didn't do anything stupid. Tell me about it. Morning, Pheebs. Well, my movie has been officially canceled. Joey, I'm so sorry. You want my breakfast? Too depressed to eat. I'll probably eat in, like, five minutes. I'll fly home with you. What time is your flight? -What about my cab? -I don't need that anymore. You borrowed my cab. You have to drive it back. I don't wanna drive back by myself. I get lonely. How about if you come with me? -It's a long trip. -That would be great. We could talk and play games. This could be our chance to, like, renew our friendship. Are you asking me to have a ""frienaissance""? Sure? All right, although I don't think we need one. I never stopped loving you. So has anybody talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet? They left me a message. They'll be here. Where is the waitress? I'm starving. It's a buffet, man. Here's where I win all my money back! I gotta talk to you. Sure. What's up? Monica and I almost got married. My God! That's huge! Wait a minute. Why wasn't I invited? And who was gonna be your best man? Don't say Ross. Do not say Ross. I just don't think that Monica and I are ready yet. I love her. . . . . .but seeing Ross and Rachel come out of that chapel. . . . . .was like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast, you know. How do I tell her without crushing her? Tell her she's not marriage material. What? Girls say it to me all the time. And if she's anything like me, she's just gonna be relieved. How do I tell him that it's too soon? He's gonna think I don't love him anymore. -Well, you don't. -Yes, I do. Good. I was just testing you. -Hey. -Oh, hi. We were just talking about bacon. No, we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable. Thank you. Coffee. What? Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? What do you mean ""Iast night""? Nothing happened last night. Ross invited us all to watch. We weren't gonna miss our friends marrying. Who got married? You did. What? -Hello. We didn't get married. -No, we didn't. That's ridi-- Wait, wait, wait. I remember being in a chapel. They would not let us get married when we were that drunk. They let you get married. Most people who marry in Vegas are drunk. Now, I'm drunk right now. I can't have a mimosa with breakfast? I'm on vacation. What are you gonna do? Well, I guess we find a divorce lawyer. Well, I think, I think Ross already has one. Now, this one's free, right? Because you paid for the first two. Laugh it up, but the joke's on you. . . . . .because we don't need to get divorced. -We're just gonna get an annulment. -An annulment? Ross, I don't think surgery is the answer here. Oh, that's your thing! What? Your thing, that you're the guy who gets divorced. No, no, that's not ""my thing. "" I do not love getting divorced. Yes, you do. This is your third divorce. You love divorce so much, you're probably gonna marry it. . . . . .and then it won't work out, so you're gonna have to divorce it. I'm so drunk. -So what should we do? -I don't know. I know I love you. I know I love you. Where are we on the whole ""going back. . . . . .to where they have the marriages"" thing? I love you. That's a good question. Last night we let the dice decide. We should leave it up to fate again. I love you! We don't get married unless there's a sign. So say. . . . You roll another eight, then there's a sign. . . . . .that we should marry. Eight we get married. . . . . .but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 1 0, 1 1 , 1 2, we don't get married. Sounds great. Hey, we got a shooter. Money, please. -Ready? -Ready. Come on, eight. Yes, yes, eight. Eight, easy eight. -I can't believe I rolled an eight. -That was so unlikely. Let's get married. I guess. Last night I rolled a hard eight. It was the wrong kind of eight. No wedding! Damn it! I wanted it so bad! Wanna go pack? We're doing the right thing. Of course we are. We left it up to fate. If we were supposed to get married, there would be a sign. Okay, you have 1 9 questions left. Use them wisely. Come on, Joey. You can't win if you don't ask any questions! What? You promised me a fun road trip. We've been on the road for 6 hours, and you've been asleep for 5 1 /2. We are switching, and you are going to drive back. That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper! All right. And until then, you are going to sing to me. Because the radio's broken, and you are selfish, but you have a nice voice. -Really? -Sing! I wanna rock 'n ' roll all night Man, this is a long drive. Are my eyes open? No! Morning. Hey. Hey, hubby. Actually, I wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing. Yeah, I'm not gonna do that. Okay. So we'll just stay married. Yes, exactly. And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller. Wow, this is so amazing. I really thought I'd have to talk you into this more. Now I'm scared because I don't actually think you're kidding. I'm not kidding. Look. . . . . .I can't have three failed marriages. I can't, okay? I am not gonna be that guy. So what, we just stay married forever? How is this going to affect you, really? I mean, you fill some form out once in a while. . . . . .instead of checking the box ""Miss,"" you check the box that says, ""Mrs. "" It's right next to it. Okay. I'm sorry, you're right. You know what? We can stay married. . . . . .because I thought that the boxes were far away from each other. All right. Look, just. . . . . .please take a moment here. . . . . .and think about what you're asking of me. Okay? I am asking you to do me a favor. You are asking me to be your wife. And, as my wife, I think you should grant me this favor. That kid kicked me really hard. Well, you did pull his hair. -He took my snack. -I'm not getting into this again. All right, you know what? Hurts really bad. Well, I told you not to walk. Here. There. There. Okay. -This doesn't mean anything, does it? -No. How could you pick up a hitchhiker? He could be a rape-- He could be a rapist or a killer or something. Don't you think I asked him that before he got in? I'm not talking to you. You go back to sleep. And, you, are you a rapist? No. Do you like car games? Yeah, you know the license plate game? I love the license plate game! I'll play. I'll play. No, you need your sleep. Night-night. Listen. I know you wanted to talk to me. . . . . .but I have an idea that may make you wanna stay married. We register. . . . . .and you get to keep all the presents. No, Ross, come on. No, listen. I've thought about how to tell you this. The bottom line, Ross. . . . . .is, we cannot stay married. -I don't know if that's true-- -Oh, but it is. Okay. You know what this is? This is a difference of opinion. -When that happens in a marriage-- -Ross, come on! This is not a marriage! This is the world's worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will. All right. All right, I'll do it. Thank you. Hey, hey. . . . . .is there any such thing as an annulment shower? There's the train station, where I get off. I have your address and phone number. I have your name and the fact that you're a drifter. So ball's pretty much in your court. All right. See you, Pheebs. Come on, Pheebs, I can't take this anymore. Please talk to me. Let me make it up to you. Ground control to Major Tom Commencing countdown Engines on Take your protein pills And put your helmet on -This is-- -Stop it! Stop it! No! That's not fair. You know I can't resist that beautiful voice. Pheebs, look, I am so sorry. I promised you a fun road trip with your friend. . . . . .and I didn't deliver, okay?

So can we play 20 Questions now? I got a good one. I thought about it since Kansas. Okay. Is it. . . . . .a kind of hot sandwich? Yes. Is it a meatball sub? That is incredible! You are the master! Bug! -You look like you're-- -Don't say it! Don't even think it. All right. Chandler, enjoy your handful. Should we just get married? All the signs are telling us to do it. I'm sick of the signs. -I'm happy the way things are. -Me too. -I don't want change, do you? -No. Then nothing changes! Everything stays the same! Go unpack. It's been three days, and it drives me insane! Jeez, relax, it's not like we're mar-- You know, I was thinking what if l. . . . . .unpack here? All your stuff would be here. Well. . . . What if all my stuff was here? Then you'd be going back and forth all the time. Doesn't make any sense. Okay. What if we live together, and you get what I'm saying? Live together? There've been no signs for that. Me asking is kind of a sign. Yes! Yes! Yes! Okay. Okay, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Here's your key. Here's your key. Now go out and christen it! Go out and come back in! Door hasn't been locked in five years, but okay. -Ready? -Ready! The key broke in the lock, and I can't get in. Wait. Oh, my God, I can't get out! -This isn't a sign! -No, it's a very old key! -It's an old key! -Oh, my God, it's old! I love you. I love you. Are you hugging the door right now? No. Yeah, yeah, me neither. So did everything go all right with the annulment? Oh, yeah. No problems. It's all taken care of. Ross, thank you. Do you wanna go see a movie? -Yeah, why not? -Pheebs? Thanks, I've already seen one. Okay, I'm gonna get my sweater. You wanna hear something weird? Always. I didn't get the annulment. What? We're still married. Don't tell Rachel. See you later. What are you doing? Key is stuck in the lock. I can fix it. Hold on. Watch out, watch out. It still doesn't work. I'm not finished. Nice job, Joe.

Your tombstone can say whatever you want. It can say, ""Ross Geller: Good at Marriage. "" You know what? Mine's gonna say, ""Phoebe Buffay: Buried Alive.

I gotta go find Rachel. If you see her, give her some really bad news, so mine doesn't seem so bad. Something bad to tell Rachel. Bad news for Rachel. What could that be? Can you just lay off, please? My life is an embarrassment. I should just go live under somebody's stairs. It's not that big a deal. You'll have been divorced three times. You'll have a life, you'll date-- No, I won't. I'll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four-Divorce Guy. . . . . .Murderer Guy. . . . . .and geologists. Ross, you're being ridiculous. You are cute and smart and sweet. That is much more important than three stupid divorces. Have you dated anyone who's been divorced three times? That's not fair. Most guys that have been divorced three times are 60. Nobody cares about this except you. This embarrassment thing is all in your head. -Here, I'll show you. Come here. -What? Hi. My friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time. But wouldn't you date him? And if you wait right here, I'll go get Ross. Thought you were Rachel. What gave me away? I gotta tell her. I told Ross and Phoebe. She's the only one left. It's official. We're moving in together. No turning back. Are you scared? Are you?! No. That was my scariest voice. You're brave. The worst day. You're finally making progress at work, then your boss calls you Racquel. Listen, for the first four years of my work, everybody called me. . . . -Seriously. -I believe you. It was in the middle of a meeting, so no one wants to correct her. So everyone's calling me Racquel. By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky. Well, I still think you're very, very nice and very pretty. What? All yours, babe. Have a seat. Listen, Chandler and l. . . . . .are going to live together. Here. Oh, my God. That's so great! I'm so happy for you guys! Really? And that was so sweet of you to ask. The three of us are gonna have such a good time living together! Yes, we are. Chandler, you'll have to watch those long showers you take. . . . . .because you know Racquel can't be late. He'll work on that. This is so exciting! Come and knock on our door We'll be waiting for you See? Once you know the stories, it's not that bad. First marriage: Wife's hidden sexuality. Not my fault. Second marriage: Said the wrong name at the altar. A little my fault. Third marriage: They shouldn't let you get married. . . . . .when you're drunk and have writing on your face. Nevada's fault. So what do you think, ladies? Who wouldn't want to date him? The divorces don't bother me. I'd date him. But not while he's still married. And you, wouldn't you want to date? I'm not dating at all anymore. I was only dating guys that were bad for me. So I decided that-- Good. Good. Whatever. And you, Meg? Well, I don't care about the divorces, either. But I wouldn't date him. It's just that he's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl. What? She said, ""He's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl. "" This is crazy. I mean, yes, Rachel is my good friend. And I have loved her in the past. . . . . .but now, she is just my wife. Phoebe, will you help me out here? Well, I thought you loved her when you married her. We were drunk! I would've married Joey with that amount of alcohol. You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani! I'm sorry, but you guys are wrong. I just don't want to be divorced three times. Now he's using this three-divorces reason. . . . . .because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, well done. Bravo, Meg. Fine. If this is what you think, forget about. . . . . .the whole three-divorce thing. I'll go to my lawyer's office right now and get this marriage annulled. She means nothing to me. Nothing! Okay, now I wouldn't date you because you seem a little creepy. I am so attracted to him right now. When will we tell Rachel what actually will happen? Soon. I just couldn't before. You saw how upset Joey got. I couldn't do it. She's my best friend. Joey's my best friend. I'm not your best friend? You just said--! Of course, you're my best friend. Would you tell Rachel? All right. At least I'm prepared. Oh, yes. -They're not for you. Are you upset? -I am now. Hey, roomie. Okay, bye. There's something important I have to tell you. Are you pregnant? No, but I'm throwing this shirt away. I think there was a little misunderstanding before. When I said that Chandler and I wanted to live together. . . . . .we meant alone together. Oh, my God. That's funny. I can't believe I did that. No, sweetie. You know what? This is my fault. I wasn't clear. I'm really sorry. Listen, you take as much time as you need to move out, okay? There's absolutely no rush. Okay. Don't you want a cookie? Sure. Thanks. Do you need a tissue? -Where did you get these? -I made them. Oh, God, they're so yummy! It's gonna be weird when I come home and you're not here. No more Joey and Chan's. No more J and C's. Want to go to Joey and Chandler's? Can't. It's not there. I'll be across the hall. We can still do all the same stuff. We won't be able to have those long talks at night. . . . . .about our feelings and the future. Not once did we do that. I told Rachel that it's just gonna be the two of us. Oh, yeah? Well, how'd she take it? Really well. Surprisingly well. She didn't cry. She wasn't angry or sad. And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry? All I'm asking for is a little emotion. Is that too much to ask after six years? What, are Rachel and I not as close as you guys? I mean, did we not have as much fun? Don't I deserve a few tears? When we told Joey, he cried his eyes out. I did not cry my eyes out! Come on, it's like the end of an era. No more J-Man and Channy's! Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that? You got married again? Yes. So that's your second marriage in two years? Yes. Second in two years. Third, overall. I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years. . . . . .and never have I had so much business from one client. Why don't you tell me what happened? Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas, and we got drunk. I'm sorry, is this the same Rachel whose name you said. . . . . .at the altar in the second marriage? Yes, yes, yes. But I do not love her. That's better then. This was just a drunken mistake, and I need to get it annulled. I see. Have you considered therapy? I think just the annulment for today. -There are some forms to fill out. -Easy. We'll need witnesses who can testify that you were not of sound mind. No problem. We'll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge. There's no way to do this without her? Because I kind of already told her it was taken care of. Of course you did. Look, you can't get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there. What about someone who looks like Rachel? I will think about the therapy. So I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff. Okay. No point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out. . . . . .and us not living together anymore. What about this? Who gets this? I don't know if I want it because it might be too many memories. -What is that? -I don't know. How about this? I want you to have the big plate. Wow, Monica, thanks. I love this plate. Something to remember me by. Mon, you're not dying. I'm just moving out. We're gonna see each other all the time. But still, it's a big change. The end of an era, you might say. Are you okay? You're not blinking. I'm fine. I was thinking about how it's an end of an era. Oh, all right. But I gotta say, I don't think six years counts as an era. An era is defined as a significant period of time. It was significant for me. Maybe it wasn't significant to you! -What is the matter with you? -What is the matter with you?! Why aren't you more upset? Aren't you gonna be sad that we're not living together? Aren't you gonna miss me at all? Monica, all right. But don't get mad at me. It's just a little hard to believe. What's hard to believe? I mean, it's you guys. You do this kind of stuff, you know? You were gonna get married in Vegas, and then you backed out. I'm not upset because I don't see you going through with it. I'm sorry. It's going to happen. Chandler will move in here. -But l-- -I know, just let me finish, okay? This isn't something that we just impulsively decided to do in Vegas. This is something that we both really want. And it is going to happen. It is? Really? Yeah, sweetie. You mean, we're not gonna live together anymore? Oh, my God. I'm gonna miss you so much. I'm gonna miss you. I mean, it's the end of an era! I know! -Okay, bye. -Oh, no. So did you get the annulment? I couldn't. I knew it. Because you love Rachel. It's not that. Annulments are more complicated-- Complicated because of the love. I do not love Rachel. I'm telling her about the whole thing. . . . . .so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Would I do that if I loved her? I've never been more convinced of your love for her. I do not have feelings for Rachel, okay? Oh, what's wrong? Monica and Chandler are moving in here. . . . . .and I have to move out and everything is changing. Oh, my God, come here, come here. It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay. Thank you. Of course. So Ross and Rachel got married. Monica and Chandler almost got married. You think we should hook up? Oh, we do. But not just yet. Really? Well, when? Well, first Chandler and Monica will get married. . . . . .and be filthy rich, by the way. But it won't work out. I know. Then I'll marry Chandler for the money. And you'll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids. Great. But then we ditch them and we get married. We'll have Chandler's money and Rachel's kids. Getting custody will be easy because of Rachel's drinking problem. What about Ross? I don't want to go into the whole thing. But we have words and I kill him. <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"
603,"Check it out, this is unbelievable! Joey's been holding his breath for almost four minutes. You trying to kill me? I want to ask you something. Since I'm moving out, and you're so beautiful. . . . . .how about I move in with you? That would be great, but what do we do about Denise? -Who's Denise? -My roommate. Your roommate? Yes, Denise. Denise! What is with the secrecy, Phoebe? What about Denise? She cute? How can you have a roommate that we don't know about? Because you never listen to what I say. I talk about her all the time. Denise! I'm gonna have an extra room over at my place. That's true. Move in with me. We can stay up late talking, and watch movies. You know about naked Thursdays, right? Yeah, yeah. I think I'll find my own place. Hey! I thought naked Thursdays was just our thing, man. The One With Ross' Denial English Subtitles by Gelula/SDI What did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her? Oh, that. She took it really well. -You didn't tell her, did you? -No. Because you're in love with her. I am not in love with her. She was upset about having to move out. If she knew we were still married, she'd have been more upset. So I comforted her. As a friend. You ""comforted her""? Nothing. I just gave her a hug. A classic sign of love, the hug. It's also a sign of friendship. Not in your case, ""Lovey Loverson. "" It was a hug. Did you, or did you not, smell her hair? Smell her hair? What if I did? Ninety percent of a woman's pheromones come out of her head. That's why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them. Come on, Ross, you're a scientist. I was hugging her as a friend. It's not my fault her hair got in my face. She's got a lot of it, and it smells all. . .all. . . . . .coconutty. What? It doesn't mean I have feelings for Rachel. Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts. Okay, but be careful. Rachel's not in the same place you are. If the place you're referring to is being in love. . . . . .she is in the same place as me, because I am not in that place. I didn't understand that. Maybe that's because you were speaking the secret language of love. -A guy just called for you. -Who was it? I don't know. How about ""Thanks for taking the message""? When you move in. . . . . .Rachel's room will be empty. Let's talk about what to do with it. I think we should have a beautiful guest room. . . . . .with a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with fresh flowers. And comment cards so people could tell us how great their stay was. I really haven't thought about it that much. Well, I like that idea. . .obviously. I was thinking maybe. . . maybe it could be a game room. You can buy old arcade games, like Space lnvaders and Asteroids. . . . . .for $200. The real ones. The big, big, big ones! No. You mean ""No"" as in: ""What an interesting idea. Let's discuss it before we reject it. "" I'm sorry. Interesting idea. But no. So that's it? I just don't think arcade games go in a beautiful guest room. . . . . .filled with antiques. Which is why Asteroids is perfect. It's the oldest game. What's wrong with a beautiful guest room? I'm not against it. Especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away. Are you mocking me? No, I'm not mocking you or your beautiful guest room. Monica and I had a stupid fight. You're still moving in together, right? My ad came out today. ""Wanted: Female roommate, nonsmoker, nonugly. "" Nice. I figured it'd be more interesting to have a female roommate. Someone I could learn from. Someone who's different than me. And what's more different than me, a guy who's not 1 9. . . . . .than a girl who is 1 9? Not just a hatrack, my friend. Pheebs, I have to ask you-- I'm swamped right now. You're just staring into space. I'm trying to move that pencil. -This one? -It worked! Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is a nightmare. Anything I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. Look. ""Wanted: Female roommate, nonsmoker, nonugly. "" There's nothing. This city is full. Wait! Look at this! ""Two bedroom, two bath. Must be nonsmoker. Satan worshipers okay. "" Yeah, but it's on the ground floor. -Rach, you still looking for a place? -Yeah, why? This guy, Warren, from the museum is going on a dig for two years. He's got this great place he needs to sublet. You interested? Great! I'd love to live at Warren's. I love Warren! -Thank you! -Don't thank me. Thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago. . . . . .killing, but perfectly preserving, an entire civilization. Here's Warren's number. This is great. I'm gonna call him right now! Thank you! Okay, you go call him. I saw it. What are you talking about? I'm talking about what you already know but won't admit. You love her again. You re-love her. I do not re-love her. I can't believe you won't just admit it. Promise me you won't do anything stupid. We're just friends now. Why would I do anything stupid? The apartment is already subletted. It's hopeless. I'll never find anything. Live with me. -What? -What?! What? Are you serious? I would love to live with you. That's great. Thank you. I'm just glad I could help you out. Wow, I'm so happy for you guys. This is so, so, not stupid. Ross, you have no idea what this means to me. I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me. You're my hero. Hero? I don't know. Well, all right. I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has. Oh, please. You're gonna say things now, aren't you? No. No, I won't. But I should tell you this. The same thing happened to my roommate, Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her. He said he didn't love her, but he really did. And it just blew up. And that's how she ended up living with me. Okay, that's a lie. Listen, I'm sorry about before. I don't need a game room. I only played those games because I couldn't get girls. Now I can get-- Now I have you. No, not that I think I have you. . . . . .or think of you as property in any sort of way. I see women. . . . Stop it, Chandler. I'm sorry too. -Really? -Yeah. Oh, yes. We can think of something to do with the room together. Great idea. We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room. Totally. -We don't have to decide now. -Good. Let's think about changes we can make in the living room. Changes? We'll have to move some furniture to make room for my chair. You're bringing the Barcalounger over here? Is that a problem? It's just that they're a set and should stay together. That's cool. I'll bring them both over. You're taking them away from their home. I get it. I get nothing. Nothing here is mine. Everything is yours. I'll get up in the morning, put on your clothes and go off to work! Yeah, that's it. Everything will be mine. Nothing will be yours. I'm talking about the Barcalounger. It doesn't match. Where will it go? In the game room! It is not my fault your chairs are incredibly ugly. That's fine. I won't bring the chairs. I won't bring anything! I wouldn't want to ruin the ambiance over here at grandma's place! Everything on your application looks really good. Just one last question. Will your friends be over here, partying and hanging out? Don't worry. I'm not a party girl. Don't just be blurting stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Call off the roommate search. Hi. I'll be living here. Ignore him. He's just some guy who wants the apartment. But he's not going to get it. You took down the shower curtain? That thing was a hazard! I'm very safety conscious. I was just clearing some space for your stuff. Thanks. But listen, Monica and Chandler had a big fight and they're not moving in. What do you mean, not moving in? They're still moving in, right? No, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room. Over a stupid room? I feel kind of bad for them, but now I don't have to move in here! Oh, no. Yeah, that part's great. What's all this about you guys fighting? Is this really over a room? That is so silly. We can handle this. Apparently not. And I can't stand by and watch two people I care about so much. . . . . .be hurt by something that is so silly. Enough of the silliness. Tell her to stop being silly. Two very good points. I've known you both a long time. And I've never seen either of you one-millionth as happy. . . . . .as you've been since you got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. What's more important, love. . . . . .or silliness? Well, we are fond of the silliness. But we also have a soft spot for the love. -Love is the best medicine. -That's ""Iaughter. "" -Why do you do it? -I don't know. Now, Chandler, you want to live with Monica, right? Yeah, I do. And, Mon, you want to live with Chandler? Yes. A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York! So I understand you're looking for a place? No, I'm staying put. I was going to offer you my apartment. Why? Where you going? I don't know. You won't believe it. Monica and Chandler are moving in again. That's great news, right? I mean, for them, right? But on the bright side, we get to be roommates again. Yeah. You know, about that. . . . I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything. . . . . .but don't you think it'll be weird? Why? Why would it. . . . Why would it be weird? Well, you know, because of us. Because of our history. No! No, no! It would only be weird if we were still in ""that place. "" Are you still in that place? No, not at all. Good. Me neither. So it's not a problem. We're just two friends who happen to be roommates. Okay, but eventually you and I will be dating. Really? We are? Yeah. I'll have a boyfriend and you'll have a girlfriend. That'd be great. But if you think it'll be okay, we'll just work out a system. It'll be like in college. I'll hang a sign on the door: ""Come back later. I'm getting lucky. "" Yeah, I didn't think of that. So are you sure about this whole moving-in thing? It's a really big step. And what's the rush? That's very funny. He's being silly because he knows we enjoy the silliness. No, I'm serious. Think about it. You move in. You start fighting over game rooms. Next thing you know, you break up. It was just a stupid fight about a room. There are no stupid fights! This isn't about the room. This is about what the room represents. And unfortunately, this room could destroy you! -I'm not so worried. -Me neither. Fine. It's your life! I just don't want to see you break up. Which you will do if you move in together. But if that's what you want, there's nothing I can do. Don't do it! -You still want to move in together? -Of course. Ross didn't scare you? Scared me out of wanting to live with him. -I gotta show you something. -Okay. Oh, my God! Someone's killed Square Man! The Barcalounger can go here. You can see the TV, and it's still walking distance to the kitchen. Oh, that's so sweet. I want to show you something too. You know those big road signs that say ""merge""? I thought we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because that's you and I together. ""Merge! "" -I love that! -Really? ""No! "" I found you in my bed How'd you wind up there? You are a mystery Little black curly hair Little black, little black, little black Little black curly hair If you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows. . . . . .please give me money so I can buy a computer. Where are the other guys? Well, Monica and Chandler are occupied. -Fighting? -The other thing. It's great they worked things out. There's no breaking them up, is there? Can I borrow the key to your house so I can go make a copy? -Here. -Thank you. Are you sure? Once I make a copy, there's no turning back. Yeah, I'm sure. Now get out of here before I change my mind. You think moving in with Rachel is a good idea? I've been back and forth. Well, maybe you should go back. She moves in, and before you know it. . . . . .you're right where you don't want to be, back together. I don't think so. She's already talking about dating other guys. That's not going to work out. She'll come home all weepy. . . . . .and you'll be telling her, ""Oh, that's okay. You'll find someone. "" And then, bam! She finds you! Maybe you're right. Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again. Is that what you want? Is that what I want? Yes. Here she comes. I'm gonna make your life much easier. The place was closed, so I'll copy it later. Or not. Why don't you move in with me? Whoa, Joey! Look, I know I scared you with that whole naked-Thursdays thing. . . . . .but we don't have to do that. It would be easier to move across the hall. Unless you're thinking about naked Wednesdays. Thursday's clearly not good for you. Pick a day! Come on in. Thanks for coming back. There's a lot of people interested in the room. But I've narrowed it down, and you're one of the finalists. Before I decide, I want to be sure our personalities match. So I made up a little test. I'll say a word, and you say the first thing that comes to mind. -I can do that. -Okay, here we go. -Pillow. -Fight. Very good. ""G. "" -String? -Excellent! Doggy. Kitten? Sorry! So close, though. Bye-bye! <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"
604,"Monica, which of all of this kitchen stuff is mine? This bottle opener. -And. . .? -And it's a magnet. Look at that! How weird is that? You're moving in with me. . . . . .and you have the one thing I don't have. It's like, in a way, you complete me. -Kitchen. -What? You complete me kitchen, matey! I know what you're thinking. That she'll move in with you, then fall in love with you, and then. . . . . .when she finds out you're already married, she'll be happy. You know? You're just very sad. Oh, my God! I see what this is. You are in love with Rachel! It all adds up! You're obsessed with her. It's always: ""What will you do about Rachel? Why are you moving in with Rachel? When will you confess your secret marriage to Rachel?"" You want her! Saved by the bell. Aren't these candlesticks mine? No, I bought those. Oh, right. I forgot. That you're a liar! That's great! I'll be there Monday. And thank you again. That was the head of the paleontology department. . . . . .at N. . . . . .Y. . . . . .U. Wow. What. . . . . .did he. . . . . .say? Remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate? -They loved it. -Well, who wouldn't? I know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer. It's temporary, but if they like me, it could lead to a full-time job. How great would that look on the mailbox? Professor Geller. Professor and Mrs. And Mrs.? You and Ross are still married. What? Just kidding! Oh, God! Saved your ass. The One Where Joey Loses His lnsurance English Subtitles by Gelula/SDI What's the matter? You know that psychic I see? She told me I'm gonna die this week, so I'm bummed. I know you don't know about readings, but that's the worst you can get. That's crazy. She'd say that to you? You don't believe her, do you? I don't know. She said that I'd have triplets. . . . . .but she also said one of them would be black. Just out of curiosity, did she say how you'd go? She didn't tell me I'd die till the end of the session. I wasn't gonna waste a whole other hour there! I've only got a week left. I've really gotta start living now! Hey, everyone. Well, today's my first lecture. . . . . .and I wanted to try it out on you guys. Do you mind? No, that'd be great! ""There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two. . . "" This is it. This is what's gonna kill me. "" . . .subcategories. The first of these subcategories is--"" Are there naked chicks on that piece of paper? No. Why? I never seen a guy stare so hard at something that didn't have chicks on it. ""There are three primary theories. . . . . .concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories. . . . . .can be further subcategorized. . . . . .into--"" Why don't you open with a joke? Open with a joke? It's a university, not a comedy club. Wait a minute, hold the phone. You're not talking about Chuckles University? Come on, we're kidding. You know what might make it less boring? Thank you. Some visual aids. -You know what's a good visual aid? -Don't say naked chicks. Why not? I don't even know why I talk to you guys about it. I'm just gonna do it on my own, with no naked chicks. That's the way I did it till I was 1 9. Any good mail? Something from the Screen Actors Guild. It's probably a residual check. Can you open it? I got. . . . ""Benefits lapsed. "" That's weird. I don't remember being in a movie called Benefits Lapsed. It's not a check. Your health insurance expired because. . . -. . .you didn't work enough last year. -Let me see that. Oh, I can't believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance, I could get hit by a bus. . . . . .or catch on fire, you know? And it wouldn't matter. Now I gotta be careful? I'm sorry. There's never a good time to have to. . . . . .stop catching on fire. All right, well. . . . . .I guess I gotta go see my agent. Make sure to look both ways before you cross the street. ""Make sure to look both ways before you cross the street. "" Hey, you're still alive! How are you feeling? It's so exhausting, waiting for death. Oh, by the way, do you think you-- What are you doing? Preparing you for-- Didn't you think I was dead? Did that not come off? Yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we'd lost you forever. -You wanna lie down? -Yeah, thanks. Can you do me a favor? Wake me up in a couple hours. You know, if you can. Did you take these back? I liked them so much that I bought some for myself. They're really great, aren't they? I love them. Nice try. How'd the lecture go? It went great. And I didn't need any jokes or naked chicks either. That's great. I'm sorry we weren't supportive before. I knew I just had to let the material speak for itself. Everyone's all, ""Ross, you have to be funny and sexy. "" Well, I proved them wrong! And now I'm gonna pass the news on to Joey and Chandler. -That you're not funny or sexy? -That's right! -Hey, Estelle, listen-- -Well, well, well. Joey Tribbiani. So you came back, huh? They think they can do better, but they all. . . . . .come crawling back to Estelle. What are you talking about? I never left you. You've always been my agent. Really? Oh, well, no harm no foul. Look, you gotta get me some work. I lost my health insurance. All right, first thing we gotta do: damage control. -Why? -Well, I think. . . . . .someone out there. . . . . .may have been bad-mouthing you all over town. The bastard! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow. And I'll have my health insurance back in no time. That's great, but shouldn't you be on the toilet right now? What's wrong with you? Nothing. I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before. And then I passed out. . . . . .and I haven't been able to stand up since. But I don't think it's anything serious. This sounds like a hernia. Go to the doctor. No way. If I go to the doctor, it'll be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! That's a hernia. Why'd I have to start working out again? Damn you, 1 5s! The lecture doesn't end for 1 5 minutes. -We can sneak in and watch. -Good. Oh, hey, look! There's some Kappa Kappa Deltas. I was a Kappa. Hey, sisters! Wow, we really are bitches. Right. So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory. . . . . .he made a startling discovery. What he believed to be igneous was, in fact, sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when-- Oh, bloody hell. What the hell are you doing? Look, I was nervous. You guys had me all worried I was gonna be boring. I got up there and they were all, like, staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out. Yeah, and not a very good one. Will you, please. . .? Dr. Geller? Kurt Rathman. I'm a paleontology professor here. Do you have a moment to talk about your lecture? I'm sorry, I've got plans with my sister. Monica Geller. Right. Will you excuse us for one moment? -What are you doing? -You can have an accent, but I can't? Top of the morning to you, laddies! Would you just please stop? Yes, yes, Bombay is very, very nice this time of year. Hey, will you grab me a cruller? Sit down! Will you go to the hospital? Hernia operations cost. . . . . .a lot probably, okay? Besides, it's getting darker and more painful. That means it's healing. Look, I'll loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let's just get that thing. . . . . .pushed back in. Thank you, but it'd take me forever to pay you back. I don't want that hanging over my head. Besides, when my insurance kicks in. . . . . .I can get all the free operations I want. I'll probably start with that laser eye surgery. What's going on? Joey's got a hernia, but it's nothing a little laser eye surgery won't fix. I'm telling you, if I put my hand on my stomach. . . . . .it doesn't hurt that bad. Hey, maybe you'll die! Chandler, I'm scared. No, we can go together. Just don't wait too long, because I'm out of here sometime before Friday. But I don't want to die. It'll be fun. We'll come back and haunt these guys! -Give me them! -No, they are mine! -You stole them from me! -You stole them from me! Give me them! Just wanna each take one? Yeah, that seems fair. We never use them. Look, I really need some help, okay? Why did I have to speak in a British accent? What do I do? Why don't you phase it out? Yeah, phase the accent out. People will think you're adjusting to life in America. Come on. No one will even notice. They're probably not even listening to you. They're not listening to me? Of course they're listening to you. Everybody listens to you. Monica, do you think I should try this phasing-out thing? I think you look fine. Whenever you're ready. Hey, Timmy. I've got a surprise. . . . . .for you. Hold it. I'm sorry. The surprise is a new swing set. If you could play it less intense. Oh, yeah. Sure, no problem. Just hold on one second. Hey, Timmy. I've got a surprise for you! Oh, my God! So that's why I feed my dog Purina One. Pick up a bag today. -That's where you pick up the bag. -Exactly. The line is, ""Pick up a bag,"" so you need to pick up the bag. Or I could just point to it. Purina One. Point to a bag today. I didn't get it, did l? Joey Tribbiani. I'm here to audition for ""Man. "" You mean ""Dying Man. "" -Do it one more time. -Really? Really? Okay. Hello, Ross? This is Dr. McNeely from the Fake Accent University. We'd like you to come onboard full-time! Listen to this! My reading was wrong. I'm not going to die. Really? How do you know? My psychic is dead! She must have read the cards wrong. I'm sorry. Better her than me. Hey, let's bake cookies! Listen, I'm really glad you got the part. Are you sure you can do this? And thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping me take a shower. Now, is that ""never talking about it again""? We're ready for you. This is Alex. He'll be playing your son. Hi, Alex. As you can see, my hands are not in my pants. All right, Alex. Now, when Joey says his line. . . . . . ""Take good care of your mama, son,"" that's your cue to cry. Got it? All right, let's do this. Scene five, take one. And action! Take good care of your mama, son. Take good care of your mama, son. Come on, son. Your mama's good people. Cut! Alex, remember, you're supposed to cry. Can you cry for us this time? All right. From the top. Scene five, take two. Take 36 is up. Let's try this again. You ready, Joe? One thing, is it all right if I scream. . . . . .right up until you say, ""Action""? Sure. -Action! -Take good care of your mama, son. Cut! I'm sorry. Why don't you lift up your shirt? Take a look at this, kiddo. We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras! -Hello, is Ross there? -No, he's not. Can I take a message? Yes, this is Russell, Ross ' divorce lawyer. Since I haven't heard from him, I assume he's giving the marriage a try. Ross got married again? All right, keep going. We are phasing the accent out. Phasing it out. ""So without retesting their results in the laboratory. . . . . .the team would never have identified. . . . . .the initial errors in their carbon dating. . . . . .analysis. "" Were there any questions at this point? What's happening to your accent? Come again? What's this nonsense? All right. I'm not English. I'm from Long lsland. I was really nervous, and the accent. . . . . .just came out. I'm sorry. So if we could just get back to the lecture. Were there any questions? About paleontology? I was just trying to make a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is important. . . . . .because I'm hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you'd just give me another chance to make a good impression-- Ross! Are you crazy? I am still your wife? Were you just never gonna tell me? What the hell is wrong with you? I could just kill you! Well, hello, Rachel! You've really done this before? You just take a big, big swing, okay? Now, don't hold back. What are you doing?

Yeah, so did l. I don't know why I was so nervous. . . . . .and why Frank and Alice complain. This is easy. Yeah, two hours, a lifetime, that's the same. Check it out! When the babies wake up. . . . . .they can meet Krog! That thing could put someone's eye out. He can do more than that. He can destroy the universe. They could swallow one of those little parts. Also, look at his smooth area. That's just gonna mess them up. They won't swallow anything. You're too overprotective. When I was a kid, my mom used to throw me into a pile of broken glass. -What? -Glass, sand, whatever. Look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep. Oh, it's so cute. I wonder when you stop putting both legs behind your head. I can still do that. How are you still single? I thought about it, and maybe you're right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy. -What made you change your mind? -I swallowed his sonic blaster gun. How did that happen? I was trying to prove that I was right. And it turns out I was wrong. . . . . .and now it's lodged in my throat. This whole time we were concentrating on the babies. . . . . .and no one was watching Chandler! You are asking the court for an annulment? Yes, Your Honor. Here are our forms, all filled out. So based on your petition. . . . . .you are seeking an annulment on the grounds. . . . . .that ""Mr. Geller is mentally unstable. "" Fine. I'm mentally unstable. And based on the fact that ""Mr. Geller is an intravenous drug user. "" -What? -Yes. Heroin and crack. Crack isn't even an intravenous drug. Well, you would know. Now, it also says here that you. . . . . . ""Iied about your sexual preference before marriage. "" Oh, come on. Ross, please. I found the magazines. And, finally, that you were ""unable to consummate the marriage. "" Well, that makes sense since you're gay and addicted to heroin. You know, I'm sorry, this is insane. I'm not addicted to heroin, I'm not gay, and there is no problem. . . . . .with my ability to consummate anything. I'll consummate this marriage right here, right now! That won't be necessary. And when we were dating, we consummated like bunnies. If you were involved in a serious relationship, that creates a problem. Rest assured, that relationship ended two years ago. Strike ""consummated like bunnies"" from the record. Is there anything in this record that is actually true? Well, yes. We got married in Vegas. And the names, I think. Based on what I've heard, you certainly don't qualify for an annulment. If you don't wanna be together, file for divorce. That's great. You happy? Look what you did with your funny, funny form. What? Me? What about you and your ""consummated like bunnies"" nonsense? And what-- What are you typing that for? She said we don't get the annulment. Don't type that. What-- Stop typing! Stop typing! ""Stop typing, stop typing! "" Okay, do you see what you're keeping me married to? Get out of my chambers. Lady, here's the deal. I came here for an annulment, and I'm not leaving here until I get one! -Would you like a night in jail? -Thank you for your time. That Porsche guy took his car back. But you found the keys to his clothes? No, I just love the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche. They'll think you own one because of the clothes? Of course. Only an idiot would wear this stuff if he didn't have the car. That is true. Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun. Oh, I've been there. I am gonna go drive my Porsche. You know you don't actually have one. What are you doing? I'm in character. Will you talk to her? I think it just moved. It's poking me. We'll go to the emergency room. No, you can't leave me here with them. We're babysitting. The babies are asleep. You'll be okay on your own. You can't leave me with them. We're a team. We're playing a zone. They'll triple-team me! He's got plastic in his throat. We gotta go to the hospital. But a doctor won't be able to help him. And it's just gonna. . . . . .naturally pass through his system in seven years. -I think that's gum. -I'm pretty sure it's gun. This really hurts. Let's go. But no! A real man wouldn't just run to the hospital. No! What would Krog do? Why isn't that valet back with my Porsche? Maybe because you've got the keys? -That was totally your fault. -My fault? You threatened the judge. You ripped the paper out of the court reporter's machine! That was the only way I could get him to stop typing! Hi. How are the Gellers? Don't call us that. The judge wouldn't let us get an annulment. Now we gotta get a divorce! Did a Porsche throw up on you? It's ""Porsche-a"" ! Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe, right? I'm gonna take that spit bubble as a ""Yeah, I do! "" Let's get rid of this dirty diaper. I'll set you up with a clean one. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up. Because, let's face it, we're at Monica's. I broke it. All right. Well, that's just the way things go. Okay. Good. Why are there only two of you? Where's Leslie? Well, you can't answer. Leslie? Where are you, Leslie? Now would be a good time for your first words. Well, look at you! You are a little bit mischievous. My gosh! Oh, you're a lot mischievous. Well, it'll dry. You sit with your brother and sister now. . . . . .who aren't there. How do you feel? Let's just say, Krog will be equipped to destroy the universe again. . . . . .in 1 2 to 1 4 hours. I totally took care of the babies all by myself. I fed them, bathed them and put them to bed. And protected them from a tornado? Oh, my God! I know. The babies are asleep. Phoebe, what happened here? I did it. I took care of the babies all by myself. -But my apartment! -Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph. But the mess! Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies. You're right. I shouldn't freak out. This is what it'll be like when we have babies. When's that? Phoebe, look at this mess! Honey, thank God you're home. I was getting worried. I picked up the divorce papers. I've already signed everything. I put little X's where you need to sign. Little X's. Great! That makes up for everything. You know, you've done a lot of stupid stuff too, okay? Name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one. How about you flew to London to stop my wedding? You told me you loved me after I was married. Wait, that was different. I did those things because I was in love with you. Right. You're right. That's very different. So let's just sign the papers. What? Nothing. Okay, can we just sign, please? Congratulations. Okay, wait, Ross. Wait a minute. I kind of have a little confession. What? Well, you know, this whole marriage thing. Kind of my idea. Excuse me? Remember how we were too drunk to remember anything when we were married? I didn't really wanna say anything, but it just kept coming back to me. We were in the casino, and you thought it'd be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So, as a compromise, we decided first to get married and then. . . . . .to eat a lot of grapes. Sorry I got us into this whole thing. So then if you think about it. . . . . .this is all your fault. Yeah, don't push it, though. I gotta say. . . . . .I know I divorce a lot of women. Never thought I'd be divorcing you. I know. I always thought if we got married, that'd be the one that stuck. And it wouldn't be a secret. . . . . .and we wouldn't have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut. Did I even treat? No, it was on the house. It was a newlywed special. That may be the most depressing thing I've heard. I should get these to my lawyer's office. Thanks for taking care of all this. No problem. -I'm gonna need a copy of those. -Totally. Careful around my Porsche! Hi, Joey. Hey. How you doing? He has the most amazing Porsche under there. I'd show you, but I just tucked her in. She's sleeping. Would you like to go for a drink? <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"
606,"I'm moving out, so you're in charge of paying the rent. -When's it due? -On the first. And that's every month? No, just the months you want to live here. Okay, here's the phone bill. Oh, my God! That's our phone number. I know I kind of sprung this me-moving-out-on-you thing. -Why don't I cover you for a while? -No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity. . . . . .anymore. -It's not charity, Joe. -Forget it. Thanks, but I'm done taking money from you. I can take care of myself. What's next? Come on. Here's the electric bill. -This is how much we pay for electric? -Well, yeah. So we'll do the rest of the bills later, then? The One On The Last Night English Subtitles by Gelula/SDI Will Joey have to give up the apartment? I offered him money, but he wouldn't take it. How much does he need? $1 500 would cover him for a few months. . . . . .but I have to trick him into taking it so I don't hurt his pride. Why don't you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on skits whenever you want. Well, that would help the pride thing. Wow, you look great! Do you wanna move in with me tomorrow? Any plans for tonight? Instead of being sad on my last night with Rachel. . . . . .we're going out to celebrate Rachel's moving in with Phoebe. -And also my birthday. -It's not your birthday. What a mean thing to say! I'd never tell you it wasn't your birthday. You guys have anything planned for the big last night? Instead of just hanging out, we figure we'd do nothing. Knicks' season opener tonight. I thought you'd come and watch it. I don't know, Ross. Not if you talk about how you gave up basketball to become a paleontologist. I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist! -Pheebs-- -You're not dressed yet? We're supposed to start having fun in 1 5 minutes! And clearly, not a minute sooner. You are packed, though, right? Please tell me you're packed? Of course I'm packed. Monica, relax. I wanted to ask Phoebe what I should wear. My God, I can't get a minute of peace. Oh, my God! Monica's just gonna kill you. I know. What you're wearing is fine for that. You're not packed! You're not packed even a little bit! Surprise! Don't get mad, because this is what happened. I started packing, then I realized, ""What am I doing?"" I am lousy at packing, right? But you love packing! So as a gift to you on our last night. . . . I'll be coordinator! Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. I didn't get you anything. Everybody has to help. Phoebe, can you help? I have plans. -You have plans with us. -That's right. Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift. Tell the guys they have to help out. My God, thank you! Monica's gonna make you pack! She's got jobs for everyone! Now, it's too late for me, but save yourselves! The movers will be here in 1 1 hours. Rachel hasn't packed. Now, everybody has to help. Chandler-- I have plans with Joey. -You said you were doing nothing. -Yes, but for the last time. Fine. Now, Ross-- -I can't do it. -Why not? -Don't you have Ben? -Because I have Ben! It's almost past his bedtime. Where is he? He's at a dinner party. He's really coming? I can see in your apartment. Of course he is. What? You think I'd use my son as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am? All right. Sorry. I gotta go make a fake Ben. Here it is. Our last pizzas together as roommates. I wish I knew that. I ordered Chinese. Well, that's okay. In a way it's kind of nice. You know? Our last dinner together. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors. . . . . .you, the food of yours! I had an idea for what to do on our last night. What do you say we play a little foosball for money? Are you crazy? You haven't beaten me since my injury-plagued '97 season. -It'd be easier to give me your money. -Yes, it would. What do you say to $50? -You're on. -Okay, let's play. The big game. Italy versus. . . . . .China, apparently. Look, it's the Rollerblades. Oh, God! You remember when we got these? I guess you weren't there. You guys, we said we were gonna have fun. Come on. Hey, remember the time. . . . You don't remember? Sorry, Pheebs. I'm just really sad that I'm leaving. I'm gonna miss you so much. This doesn't have to be so sad, though, you know? Instead of thinking about how you'll miss each other. . . . . .you should think of the things you're not gonna miss. I don't think there's anything. Come on, there's gotta be something. She's perfect. I have one. Okay, you can go first. I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact. . . . . .that you're never allowed to move the phone pen. That's a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? You know, does Rachel move the phone pen? Sometimes. Always, actually. There you go. Doesn't everyone feel better? Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages. You get your messages. It doesn't count if you have to read them off your hand. . . . . .after you've fallen asleep on the couch. So you missed a message from who? Chandler? Or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom? It worked! No one's sad! I win again! That's, like, 500 bucks you owe me! Man! Five hundred dollars. That is a lot of electricity, huh? I gotta buy some food. Give me a chance to win my money back. Sudden death. . . . . .one goal, $1 000. -You serious? -Yes! Get ready to owe me. Here we go. Ready? No. . . . . .one can beat me! That's why only the little fake men are supposed to do the kicking. Hi, Ross. See, other people call me! Your brother. Score! What's up? I'm here with Ben. Thought we'd say hi. Put him on. Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. I guess he doesn't feel like talking right now. He's smiling, though. Okay, talk to you later. I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, remember the Rollerblades? You know what else I won't miss? ""I'm Monica. I wash the toilets 1 7 times a day, even if people are on it! "" ""Hi, I'm Rachel. Is my sweater too tight? I'd better wash it and shrink it! "" ""I'm Monica. I never get messages from interesting people. "" I call her. ""Oh, my God! I love Ross. I hate Ross. I love Ross. I hate Ross! "" ""My God! I can't find a boyfriend. I'll stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find there! "" We should get a move on if we want to make those dinner reservations. Still broken? It sucks, man. Your last night, and I lose the two most important things: The foosball table. . . . . .and $500. There are other ways to win back your money. How about blackjack? Not my game. You know what? We can play a new game. -It's fun! -What's it called? Cups. -I don't know how. -I'll teach you. It's easy and fun. -All right. -Here you go. I have two queens. What do you have? -A 2 and a 5. -You win! Fifty dollars! -Really? -Let's play again. -What have you got? -4 and a 9. You're kidding, right? -No. Why? -That's a full cup! Damn, I am good at Cups! I'm not talking to her. You have to take the first step. . . . . .because she's the one who's leaving. It's harder for her. Maybe you're right. But she made fun of my phone pen! I know. I took it hard too. I feel bad about what happened-- -What are you doing? -I'm unpacking. I'm not moving. Is that picture straight? It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left. You're the one who wants this big change and move in with Chandler! You should go! Why do I have to leave? -It's my apartment! -It's mine too! What else you got? How about: You're moving! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you! -Hey, how you guys doing? -Great. Monica's moving. I am not! Really? How come all your stuff is in this box? Okay, you guys, I think I know what's going on here! You guys? Stop! I know you're acting mad because it'll make it easier to leave. But deep down, you're really sad. Deep, deep down. -No, Phoebe, I am mad! -Well, deep down! I'm just mad. Then keep running. You win! -What did you have? -Nothing beats. . . . . .a three and a six. That, my friend, is ""D Cup. "" How much have you won so far? -700. -Not 700 exactly? Double it. In Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it. I didn't make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get one card. That one card could be worth $1 00, which brings your total to $1 500. Don't get excited, that won't happen unless you get the-- No way! This is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it ""What were you thinking?"" I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler. Guys, I don't wanna make things worse, but. . . . . .I don't wanna live with Rachel anymore. You're so mean to each other. I don't wanna end up like that with Rachel. I still like you. That's fine because I'm not moving. Phoebe, you gotta take her. I said some bad stuff. . . . . .but Rachel has qualities that make her a good roommate. Like what, Monica? She has 1 47,000 pair of boots? Good start, Mon. She lets you borrow them. And you stretch them out with your big old clown feet. Do you wanna live outside? Because it's getting cold! She gets tons of catalogs and folds down the pages of things I'd like. What else? When I take a shower. . . . . .she leaves me notes on the mirror. I do. I do do that. That's nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom. When I fall asleep on the couch. . . . . .she covers me with a blanket. Well, you know, I don't want you to be cold. And when I told her I was gonna move in with Chandler. . . . . .she was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy! It's gonna be fine. Now I can't wait to live with you! You know what we should do? Bring Monica, and we'll live together! We'll have so much fun! I think she's moving in with Chandler. Oh, that's right. You're still set on that? Kinda. Oh, my God! How's the packing going? Ben? He's fine. He's right-- Oh, my God! Get your head out of your shirt there, son! Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack. -What's wrong? -Ross and I were helping pack. . . . . .took a little break. I lost $1 500 to him in Cups! How did you lose at Cups? The same way you lost! I started out with the king and the queen. Bam! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a jack and a king. Boom! Ross gets a 4 and 5. Even Ross was getting the Cup card, the D Cup. . . . . .the sitting-down bonus. I didn't even get half a cup! Nothing! Oh, man! He never played before either. I think beginner's luck is very important in Cups! Let's play one more hand. One more hand. No more! I cannot lose another dime. I'm serious this time. In fact, look. I wanna give you something. Let me give it to you before I pawn it for Cups money. I want you to have the big, white dog. . . . . .as a thank-you for being such a great roommate. I can't take the big, white dog. You love it. It's ""him. "" Not ""it. "" What if I bought it from you? Then your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price. Say $1 500? Wait a second. I see what you're trying to do here. You're trying to give me money again! When did I try to give you money? Over there with the bills! You tried to give me charity, I said no, you dropped it. We had a nice last night together. We had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money. Now you start with the charity thing again! I'm trying to help you out. I wanna make sure that you're okay. I will be okay. You gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself. I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing I'm gonna miss. . . . . .is you. And now the dog. -Call me when you get there, okay? -Okay. I'm really gonna miss you. I have your key. -Here you go. -Thanks. God, this is silly. I'll see you in a couple of hours. Bye, house. -She really left. -I know. -Thank you. -No problem, roomie. -Can I ask you a question? -Sure. What the hell is that dog doing here? I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money. -And now you want that money back? -Exactly. What kind of idiot do you take me for? It's not a real game. I made it up. I'm sorry you lost your money. But I won it fair and square. At a fake game! If you wanna try to make some of it back. . . . . .I'd be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you. I am very good at Cups. I assume the saucer card came up when you played last? Let's see if it comes up this time. <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"
607,"Ready? Hi, it's Rachel and Phoebe's. Please. . . -. . .Ieave-- -Leave. But I just said ""Ieave. "" I know because you have all the good words. What do I get? I get ""it's,"" ""and. "" Oh, I'm sorry, I have ""a. "" Forget it. -That's silly. -All right. So let's switch. No, I have all the good words. Okay, fine, fine. We can switch. - Hi. . . -. . .everybody. . . -. . .it's. . . -. . .Rachel. . . -. . .and. . . -. . .Phoebe's. Wait. How did you do that? What? Oh, you're no ordinary roommate, are you?

Okay, let's go running! -There's cute guys there. -Let's run towards them! Wait just one more second. Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's. Please leave a message. Thanks! Wait a minute. You took all the words! You've met your match, Rachel Greene! The One Where Phoebe Runs English Subtitles by Gelula/SDI I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030, there'll be computers. . . . . .that can carry out the same amount of functions as a human brain. So, theoretically, you could download. . . . . .your thoughts and memories into this computer. . . . . .and live forever as a machine. And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open. Honey, it was a great idea, nailing the boxes to the floor. -I didn't nail the boxes to the floor. -So you can move them! And while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you. Hey, everybody! I'd like you to meet Janine. She's gonna be my new roommate! And she's gonna live with me! It's nice to meet you. Janine. . .? Le Croix. I didn't know that. What a pretty last name. So where are you from? Australia. I just moved here. From the land down under? I didn't know that either! So what do you do? -I'm a dancer. -You're a dancer? She's a dancer! I think I'll go unpack. Did you interview her before you asked her to move in? Of course! What did you ask her? When can you move in? Thank you for bringing her into our lives. Unbelievable. You like her too? Look at all the boxes! I cannot wait to ask her out. Wait a minute. You can't. She's your roommate. It'll be too complicated. Yeah, don't do it. I mean, if you date her, then I can't date her. Think about it. Remember when you broke up with Donna. . . . . .how horrible it was when you bumped into her at the supermarket? Oh, God, yeah. Now imagine you live at the supermarket. Okay! You're right! I don't want that. I can't date her. You'd better watch the flirting too, because it could be trouble. Well, that's gonna be tough, Mon. It's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt. You're around me all the time, and you don't flirt. A little sad about that, sweetie? I have to tie my shoes, so you go ahead. I'll catch up. Come on, that's not running! Let's go! I'm telling you, when she runs. . . . . .she looks like Kermit the Frog. . . . . .and the Six Million Dollar Man. Monica had such a crush on him. She used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed. I used to do that too! Did you also have his album, ""It's Not Easy Being Green""? Oh, Mon. So Phoebe runs weird, huh? Yeah. And I know she'll want to run again. I don't know how to get out of it. I mean, I live with her. Why don't you be straight with her? Tell her the truth. You're right. I should just tell her the truth. Pheebs, Monica tripped me. I don't think I can ever run again, ever! Why? Why would you do that? I don't know. Rachel, I'm sorry I hurt your ankles. Ankle. We'll see. Okay. I am officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me, man. Joe? Well, I guess Joey went home. And look, there is still one box I have to unpack. I got you! Oh, my God. . . . . .you almost gave me a heart attack. It was so hard not to laugh. Hey, the place looks great. Not bad, right? Monica's working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'll do? I'm gonna go downstairs and get her some flowers. Who wouldn't want to live with me? I don't. No, I want to live with the super-hot Australian dancer! How's that going? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing? So far. But it's tough. I've got this built-up flirting energy, and I don't know how to get rid of it. How you doing? Oh, man! Sorry. There's just more room out here. No, you just reminded me that I have to do my stretches too. Why don't you try to be. . .? -What's wrong? -Nothing. I didn't want you to touch me. . . . . .because I'm all sweaty from the workout. I'm gonna hit the shower. Oh, my God! Sorry about that stuff hanging in there. It's just my thongs are too delicate for the dryer. Oh, yeah, it's me. I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out. You lied so you could run by yourself. No, Phoebe, no. I was. . . . I was actually just checking. . . . . .to see. . . . . .if I could run. And I can! Please, I'm not an idiot. No, wait. Phoebe? Wow. Couples who live together do start to look alike. So, Mondler. . . . What are you doing? What does it look like? I am cleaning. Did you get Monica's authorization to move all her stuff? I don't need that. I'll put everything back. Put it back exactly where you found it? Yes. I'm gonna put it back exactly where I found it. First of all, that attitude is not helping. She won't care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place. Hello? Did you just meet Monica? She'll recognize that I did a nice thing. . . . . .and appreciate it. Actually, this will work out well. Because when you move back with Joey. . . . . .Joey's hot new roommate can come live with me. Oh, I see. You're trying to freak me out. Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind of stuff, all right? Believe me, I lived with her for 1 6 years. She's going to freak out. Oh, my God. She's going to sit on you. No, she is not. I'll prove it to you. I'll call her right now. Phone's done. -Hey, Mon. How's it going? -Terrible. If I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I think I might kill someone tonight. Come on, it can't be that bad. The only thing getting me through. . . . . .is knowing I'll see you soon. I might even try to get out of here early. It sounds like they need you there. -You're just hanging out with Ross? -It's all good! Okay, bye! She's gonna kill me. The phone was facing the other way. And that goes back up there. We should start with the big stuff. That'll be the easiest. Let's start with the couch. I got it. That doesn't look right. What are you talking about? The couch is in line with the carpet. Then I can just walk over here and casually put my feet up on. . . . Okay, here's what we do. We move the couch closer to the coffee table. But then the back of the couch won't line up with the carpet. Well, we'll just move the coffee table. . . . . .closer to the couch. But then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area. But the coffee table doesn't match the table! Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting, but I'm drawing her to me like a moth to a flame! What the hell's going on over here? Monica's gonna kill you! I need your help. I have to do something to repel this woman. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You guys repel women all the time! Hey, I've been married three times. No, I've seen it happen. You get a rapport going with a woman, but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret? We do not repel women, okay? That is completely untrue. Oh, yes, we do, my man. Remember when we went to a dance. . . . . .and you walked up to that girl you liked and talked. . . . . .about the lrish potato famine? What about you? You weren't so hot either. After everything he said, he'd go-- Monica doesn't like that either. I should stop doing that. Girls don't like it when I start talking about science. That's not specific to girls. This is great. What else? They don't like you correcting their grammar. And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny. They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you. -Man, I am so lucky I have Monica. -I'm never gonna find love again. -Can I talk to you for a second? -Sure. Phoebe, I just wanted to say I'm sorry, okay? I handled the situation horribly. And I should not have lied to you. So what should you have done? I should have told you the truth. Which is? Well, the reason I didn't want to go running with you is. . . . . .because. . . . . .the way that you run is just a little. . . . -So? -It's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy. -Why do you care? -Because they're people! People you don't know and will never see again. Yes, but still they are people. . . . . .with eyes. I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss. . . . But okay. I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Okay. You're uptight. What? I am not uptight. I am not uptight, man. That's okay. I'm not judging you. That's just who you are. I'm more free, you know. I run like I did when I was a kid. . . . . .because that's the only way it's fun, you know? Didn't you ever run so fast you thought your legs would fall off. . . . . .Iike when you were running towards the swings or running away from Satan? The neighbor's dog. Is this in the right place? Who cares? I repel women. You can't come in here! Ross is naked! I couldn't say I was naked, because she's allowed to see me naked. Why does anyone have to be naked? Why is Ross naked? I had to show Chandler something. Naked? I guess I have. . . . . .a ""guy"" problem. Is it the same thing Chandler had? We'll get everything squared away, and you can come back later! There's still some of Chandler's medicine in the bathroom. -Bye. -Bye! Thank God. Dude, what'd you have? We have no time, okay? We must focus. We've got to get everything back into its original place. The photo album! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just match everything to the pictures! That's perfect! That's brilliant! What'd you have? I've got some beer for you. Don't you mean ""for whom""? Sure. I was gonna order some pizza. You wanna share one? Pizza? It's not like I never had that before. Is something wrong? All right, all right. Let's just get this out in the open, okay? You're hot. I'm lovable. Clearly, there's a vibe going on between us. But we're roommates. . . . . .and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road. Imagine living in a supermarket. . . . . .and you'll understand. Okay? So the question is, what do we do? There isn't anything to do. I think you're really sweet. But I'm not interested in you like that. No, I mean. . . . You're a nice guy, and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend. I'm just, you know, I just. . . . . .don't feel that way about you. I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on. -I don't think so. -Oh, I do. How you doing? I'm okay. What? What? Oh, dear God! I'm so sorry. You're right. This feels great! And you don't care if people stare. It's only a second. Then you're gone! It's amazing! I feel so free and so graceful! Watch out for the horse. Can I come in now? -Why is everything different? -Bye. I don't see anything different. . . . . .other than the fact that the room got brighter when you came into it. The end table is wrong, the couch looks bizarre. . . . . .and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets. Okay, don't be mad, okay? After I unpacked the boxes, I wanted to do something nice for you. . . . . .so I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around, and then I forgot. . . . . .where it went back. I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry. That's okay. Are you afraid of me or something? Do you want me to be afraid of you? Of course not. My gosh, Chandler, what you did is a wonderful thing. . . . . .and I really appreciate it. I have this thing where I want everything in the perfect place. But I'd never expect you to worry about that. Really? Of course. Oh, you're the best. You come here to me. Hold on, okay? First things first. Did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked? It said that by the year 2030. . . . . .there'll be computers carrying out the same number of functions. . . . . .as an actual human brain. So, theoretically, you could download your thoughts. . . . . .and your memories into this computer-- And live forever as a machine. Janine, do you know what we're doing right now? You and l, we're interfacing. I gotta go. <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"
608,"Hi, my name's Chandler. I just moved in next door. Would you like to battle me in a post-apocalyptic world. . . . . .for control of the galaxy's last remaining energy source? Sure, neighbor! Come on in! Is Janine around? She's at dance class. Can I check my room? Don't go through her stuff. She gets really mad. Oh, my God! It's like a guy never lived in here. You gotta be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. It's spreading. It is? Is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch? Is that your tiny little box that's too small to put anything in? Okay, this is not good. You are a guy, okay? This is a ""guy's"" place. Soon, you'll be soaking your fingers in stuff. -You're right. I'll talk to her. -Talk to her. Be a man! -I'm a man. -Defend yourself! We have to hem the new dust ruffle. Be right there, sweetums. Totally different situation. The One With Ross' Teeth English Subtitles by Gelula/SDI Hey, guys. -How was breakfast with Hillary? -Okay. She's still depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend. Is this Hillary, your hot assistant chef, Hillary? The one that stares at me when I come in? The one who looked at you once because you got in her way. Still, I could tell. She was into me. Why don't you set us up? Are you setting Ross up with someone? Does she have a wedding dress? Rachel? I'm making up flyers to try to get new massage clients. Can I come to Bloomingdale's and use the copier? Sure, but they might think it's weird since I don't work there anymore. Oh, my God! What happened? I got a job at Ralph Lauren. Well, that's great! Congratulations! A year ago. You've lasted all year! Good for you. You could still use the copier where I actually work. But come by at lunch so my boss doesn't see you. Kim will freak out. She doesn't like me. -I don't think my boss likes me. -I don't think mine likes me. Maybe it's a universal thing. Maybe because you're all hanging around here at 1 1 :30 on a Wednesday. Let's head off to work. -Thank you. -Sure. You will not believe this. I was making copies, and Ralph Lauren came in. Oh, my God. Did you talk to him? A little. He seems really nice. -Good kisser. -What? What? -You kissed him? -Totally. Phoebe, are you serious? He came in and introduced himself. The next thing I know, we're making out! Phoebe, you do know he's married? Phoebe. I'm supposed to ask every guy I make out with if he's married? No, yeah, I should. Hey, Joey. Can I talk to you for a second? There's a kid in this picture. Do you know this kid? ls it a relative? No. I just thought it was cute. That's what I was afraid of. Okay. . . . I really want you to feel at home here, but. . . . . .some of this new stuff, it's too girlie. Like what? Like this. Pictures of cute babies we don't know. We can't have that. Joey, it's Anne Geddes. She's a famous artist. I don't know this baby. I don't know if she's a famous artist or not. I don't want to be a jerk, but you're changing too much around here. I'm sorry. I wanted to make the place a little nicer. But it's too much stuff. You know, you got the candles and the ""foofy schmoofer"" thing here. Over here, you got a picture of a watering can. I just thought-- I'm sure it's a famous watering can. But come on. And what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom? It's a curling iron. Well, that's okay then. Okay, my towels, for instance. I come into the bathroom. . . . . .and my towel is not on the floor, where I keep it. It's up here on some hook. And it smells different. It's clean. It feels different. It's dry. All right, I can make my peace with the clean, dry towels. Also what is with these chips you bought? It's potpourri. You're supposed to smell it. Well, that's like summer in a bowl. Kim, hi. I handed in that marketing report, and I never got to hear what you thought. I didn't read it. The spring line's really gonna be great this year, huh? I hear Ralph Lauren fooled around with someone in the copy room. Tell me everything. Hey, guys. What's up? You know. . . . Oh, my God. What happened to your teeth? I whitened them. Really? What do you think? I think I shouldn't look directly at them. Come on, seriously. -They're really, really, really white. -What was wrong with your old. . . . . .human teeth? I did leave the gel on a little longer than it said to. -How much longer? -A day. Tonight is your date with Hillary. I know. That's why I did it. Are they really that bad? You'll be fine. Hillary's blind, right? She will be after tonight. Oh, Rach. Do you notice anything--? Your teeth? Yes, I saw them from outside. You guys are never gonna believe this. . . . . .but Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. -What? -Oh, my God! She ran into him at my office, and they just made out. The craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because. . . . . .it's the best gossip she's heard all year. I am proud of all my friends today. I can't believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. I'm so jealous! Hi, I'm Chandler, your live-in boyfriend. Chandler, please. Come on. Look at him. Well, I am no woman, but that is one tasty dish. Here. Who's the silver fox? That is your make-out buddy. Don't you recognize him? Oh, wait. ""Phoebe, I love you. Kiss me, please. "" That's not Ralph Lauren. It sounds like him, though. What? Ralph doesn't look like that guy. He's young, and he's got long hair and a beard and a Hacky Sack-- Oh, my God. That's not Ralph Lauren. That's Kenny the copy guy! What? I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If she finds out that I lied to her, she'll hate me even more. Phoebe! Why would the copy guy say he's Ralph Lauren? To get you to make out with him! This will make them look less white. Nope. Colors that don't work are. . . . . .blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange and purple. I don't know what I'm gonna do. The date starts in an hour. Maybe if your skin was lighter, your teeth wouldn't look so bright. Oh, great! So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you. If we put just a little bit of makeup on you-- Whoa! We're not 1 3 anymore. This is the only thing left that has a shot at working. Won't she notice I have makeup on? Half the guys out there have makeup on. What? Half the people-- I mean-- Just try it and see. I am not putting on makeup. Hello? Ross, could you put up some of these flyers for me? No! Demon! Demon! Our drawers will smell nice, and we didn't waste these pantyhose. God forbid we throw out old underwear. You know what? I'm gonna go over to Joey's. We've got to organize the wrapping paper. I've really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. In fact, we're two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple. This has been a girlie day. You're right. I'm sorry. I just feel like I need to be in a ""guy"" place. . . . . .do kind of a ""man"" thing. You go over to Joey's and. . . . . .drink some beer and hammer up some dry wall. When guys hang out, they don't just drink beer and hammer up dry wall. When girls hang out, we don't have pillow fights in our underwear. I'm sorry. We do. I don't know why I said that. Hey, Chandler. Come on in. We're knitting potholders. No, thanks, Josephine. Ross, I was wondering if-- Oh, my God! Where are all the men? -Hi, Kim. -Hi, Rachel. Remember what happened yesterday? Well, it didn't happen. You didn't cancel the fabric order? Okay, two things didn't happen. Remember I told you someone made out with Ralph Lauren? Well, it turns out that's not true. It's not true? That's interesting. Because I checked. Only one keycard was used to access the copier. . . . . .yesterday during lunch, and that keycard belonged to you. You think I made out with him? Listen to me. . . . . .sleeping with Ralph is not gonna get you my job. I don't want your job. I don't. This is a mistake. I didn't make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I didn't use my keycard yesterday. I don't even know how to use my keycard. -Hi, Ralph. -Hi, Kim. Yeah. Nothing happened. You could cut the sexual tension in here with a knife. After that, what could I do except become a chef? Soon, I hope to open my own restaurant. You're a really great listener. Most guys I go out with, they talk and talk. It's like, ""Shut your mouth. "" You know? I've been talking too much. Why don't we talk about you? Come on, I want to know. Okay. I'm from Long lsland. I came to the city for college. I have a 5-year-old son, and in my spare time. . . . . .I like to read spy novels. But let's talk more about you. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan. . . . . .your arrangement will look fresh much longer. Joey, that is such a great tip! Monica, I need to talk to the girl with the flowers. Okay, but I'm gonna teach you how to make a bird feeder. . . . . .out of a pine cone and some peanut butter. I love birds. What is the matter with you? -What? -You're arranging flowers! You got dead flowers! You've got a picture of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey! Look, I am still Joey, okay? Flowers, they're just nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist of a famous baby. You're turning into a woman. No, I'm not. Why would you say that? That's just mean. Now I've upset you? What did I say? It's not what you said. It's the way you said it. Oh, my God! I'm a woman! So now she thinks that I made out with him to get her job. -Why didn't you just tell the truth? -I did. She doesn't think anyone would confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren. What if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? What if Kenny hired that Ralph guy to be the pretty front man, huh? Did she ever think of that? You were with Kenny today. Just for a second. Phoebe, what am I gonna do? The only thing you can do. Sleep with him. I'm not gonna sleep with him. I mean, I could, but I wouldn't. Sleep with Kenny. -That wouldn't help me. -Oh, yes, it would. I've had a really good time tonight. I rarely connect with someone this much on the first date. Me neither. I've had a really good time too, you know. Are you gonna eat that bread? I just like the smell. You make me laugh. Would you like to move to the couch? Maybe I'll just turn down the lights a little? How about all the way? Okay. Wow, cool poster. Or should I say, ""groovy poster""? So. . . . . .where were we? Are those your teeth? You can see them, huh? Yes. They're insanely white. I did that for you. What's the matter with you? What's the matter with me? You've got a black light. It's 1 999! Oh, good. Kim, hi. Hi, Rachel. I wanted to ask you, have you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets? What am I thinking? Of course you have. Okay, look. I'm sorry that I lied to you before. You were right. Ralph and I were an item, but we're not anymore. Oh, really? Yeah, he dumped me. He said, ""Rachel, I can't do this. Even though you're a very, very. . . . . .very beautiful woman. . . . . .I can't do this. I'm married and I'm sorry. "" But he said, ""And you will never get promoted. . . . . .especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog. . . . . .in the Ralph Lauren machine. "" You expect me to believe-- -Hi, Ralph. -Hi, Kim. Oh, my God. He gave you the coldest look I've ever seen. It's like he hates you! Then it is true! Of course it's true. And it hurts so bad. Oh, honey, come here. Oh, it'll be okay. We've all been there. You and Ralph? Kenny the copy boy. -I need to talk to you. -What's the matter? You upset? We gotta get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. I gotta be a man! The living room has to remain a guy place, okay? That's the way it has to be. I'll just put it all in my room. Good. Great. Thanks for being so understanding. I didn't want to make a big deal out of this. But you could put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, if you want to. Okay. And maybe the watering can there. Sure. And a couple of these little tiny boxes. Joey, do you want me to put it all in your room? Okay. <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"
609,"Okay, great. Bye. Guess who's coming to Thanksgiving dinner? Sidney Poitier? I miss Rachel. My parents. Great, they haven't seen the place since I moved in. If you could not mention that we live together, that'd be great. I was thinking we'd eat around 4. Why can't I tell them we live together? They don't know we're dating. Should we eat in the kitchen? Why haven't you told them? Well, I was going to. I really was. But then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn't. Why not? Wouldn't they be happy? So, dinner in the kitchen around 4. I'll see you then. Why wouldn't they be happy? Well, because. . . . . .mainly. . . . . .they don't like you. -I'm sorry. -What? Why? Why? Maybe because you used to be aloof. . . . . .or that you're sarcastic or that you joke around. . . . . .or that you throw your clothes on the couch. Is this why they don't like me or you don't like me? I know I should have told them. I shouldn't care what they think. I'm sorry. It'll be okay because when they come over, I will be charming. I will make them love me, then we'll tell them. Will that work? I can be pretty charming, babe. I won you over, didn't l? I don't think you'll ever get my parents that drunk. The One Where Ross Got High English Subtitles by Gelula/SDI Hey. Oh, good, Ross. Your parents like me, right? Yes, of course they like you. Monica told me they don't. Yeah, they don't like you. Do you know why? Maybe it's because you're sarcastic or maybe it's because you-- If people don't know, they shouldn't just guess! Another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for. Maybe I give thanks for you shutting up, huh? Maybe I give thanks by taking my PlayStation to my place. Maybe I love you. Hey, guys. No, I don't want to play video games, Joey! Are you guys going to Chandler's for Thanksgiving? Yeah, why? Me and my friends are doing Thanksgiving uptown. I thought you might like to come. For real? You should go to Chandler's. None of us can cook. We'll just drink all day. We go to yours! We have to stop across the hall because it's my sister. But, you know, actually, growing up with a sister was nice. . . . . .because it helped me understand women. Yeah, you should tell your friends that. Okay. How you got three women to marry you, I'll never know. Pheebs, check it out! For my dessert. . . . . .I'm making a traditional English trifle. Wow. That sounds great! And what are you making, Monica? In case Rachel's dessert is so good that I eat all of it. . . . . .and there's none left for anybody else! Nothing. Nothing? No, sweetie. I trust you. If I mess this up, there's nothing else for dessert? You won't mess it up. I love that. You really have faith in me. Thank you. Question: How do you know when the butter is done? It's done about two minutes before it looks like that. -The food smells great, Mon. -And the place looks so nice. -Hey, happy Thanksgiving, everybody! -Happy Thanksgiving! -Well, this has been great. -See you. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Where you going? We did say we'd stop by this little thing Joey's roommate is having. Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl? Some would say she's attractive, yes. Who else is going to be there? Her friends. Her dancer friends? Yes! All right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there. . . . . .and they'll be drinking and dancing and we really want to go! Dude, we were good. You're not going. You said you'd eat here and you'll eat here. Yeah, and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls. . . . . .is not very Thanksgiving-y. Oh, but it is. It's like the first Thanksgiving when the lndians and Pilgrims sat down. Then the lndians taught the Pilgrims. . . . . .what it meant to be hot in the New World! -Hello, everybody! -Hi! Hi, Dad. Mom. Look! Look who it is! It's Chandler! Oh, yes, of course. Hello, Chandler. Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful. It is great to have you here. Let us take your coats. Whoa, it snowing out there? No. Monica, all this food looks wonderful. You should do this for a living. Okay, I have dandruff. There's no need to laugh and point. Chandler was laughing at your joke. My joke wasn't funny. Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night. Really? I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building. . . . . .and he was so brave and so strong. And it's making me look at him totally differently. He used to be just ""Jack Geller, Monica and Ross' dad. "" Now he's ""Jack Geller, dream hunk. "" I don't know. To me, he'll always be ""Jack Geller. . . . . .walks in while you're changing. "" You know, Dad, Chandler is one of Ross' very best friends. Ross sure is a great guy. I've always felt that how a man turns out. . . . . .is a reflection on his father. I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do? He's a headliner of a. . . . . .gay burlesque show. You're killing us. Will you serve the dessert already? There's drunken dancers a-waiting! Look at it. Isn't it beautiful? Yeah. What is it? It's a trifle. It's got all these layers. First there's a layer of ladyfingers, then jam. . . . . .then custard, which I made from scratch. . . . . .then raspberries, more ladyfingers. . . . . .then beef sauted with peas and onions. . . . . .then a little bit more custard. . . . . .then bananas and then I put whipped cream on top. What was the one right before bananas? The beef. Yeah, that was weird to me too. But then I thought, ""Well, there's minced meat pie. "" That's an English dessert. These people just put strange things in their food. Can I borrow rum from your place? Yeah, sure. While I'm gone, don't you sneak a taste. Beef in a dessert? No, no, no. There is no way. I know. And only one layer of jam? What is up with that? Oh, my God. The pages are stuck together. Chandler! Oh, my God. She made half an English trifle and. . . . . .half a shepherd's pie! Man, now she's gonna start all over. We're never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the New World. No, no, we will. We just won't tell her she messed up. Just let her serve the beef-custard thing? Yeah. It'll be like a funny Thanksgiving story. Vomiting stories are funny, I guess. Joey. God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees. Did it make you want to walk around in your underwear? No. Still not hot enough! Rachel. Okay, look at him. Look at those strong hands. Oh, what I wouldn't give to be that can of condensed milk. Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is. Thank you. I just bought it. Yes, well, it's very beautiful and it's cream-colored and tight and. . . . I don't mean tight. It's not tight. Not that I was looking at. . . . What's the matter with him? I think he's stoned again. What? I need to talk to you. I think I might know why my parents don't like you. Why? Okay, remember we were young. Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom. . . . . .and my parents walked in and smelled it. . . . . .so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window. Why did you do that? I don't know. Yours was the first name that popped into my head. I didn't think it'd matter. How could it not matter? How was I to know we'd be friends after college. . . . . .and you'd be living with my sister? What about all that ""friends forever"" stuff? I don't know. I was all high. Mom and Dad sent me to find out if you were trying to get Ross stoned. Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college, and he blamed it on me! I can't believe you! We haven't told them we're together because they hate me, so fix this. Okay, okay, I'll tell them it wasn't Chandler who got high. Now, who should I say it was? You! It's not like it's a big deal. You don't still do it or anything. All right. Now, who should I say tricked me into doing it? Dad, please don't pick your teeth out here. And if you're gonna put your feet up-- Leave him alone! Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me when I told you that Janine's friends are dancers? And that they're gonna be drinking a lot? No, I did. But tell me again because it's so romantic. You're whipping so slow. Do it faster! I don't want to make any mistakes! If I screw it up, everybody's gonna be like: ""Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?"" Just let me worry about making it, and you just worry about eating it. Oh, I am. -If you don't tell them, then I will. -Okay. Fine. Ross, can I talk to you for a second? Can it wait? I have to tell my parents something. No, it can't? Okay. We have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert. What? What is with everybody? It's Thanksgiving, not. . . . . .Truth Day! Look, when everyone eats that banana-meat thing. . . . . .they'll all make fun of her. Do you want that? We'll just get everyone to act like they like it. That way, no one makes fun of her. . . . . .and we still get to go to sweet potato pie. Dude, they're not objects. Just kidding. I'll talk to them. You distract her. Hey, Rach, can I talk to you outside for a sec? Okay. What's up, Ross? So. . . . Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us. And. . . . . .you look nice today. -Oh, no. No, Ross, don't do this. -What? I don't think us getting back together is a good idea. I thought this might happen today. I know the holidays can be rough. . . . . .and it's probably hard for you to be alone right now. You're alone. No, I live with Phoebe. I mean, you're alone-alone. And it's just not the time for us. I'm sorry. Oh, well. Can't blame a guy for trying. And if anyone needs help pretending to like it. . . . . .I learned some things in acting class. Try rubbing your stomach. Or saying ""Mmm. "" Smiling. I'm not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore. Rachel, there you are. Let's serve that dessert already! Joey, you have to stop rushing me. You don't get any dessert. Really? No, just kidding. I would never do that to you. Okay, everybody, it's trifle time. So, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn't it? -It sure is. -Wow. So did you make it with beef or eggplant? -Beef. -I can't have any. I don't eat meat. Monica, I want you to have the first taste. Really? Wait, you only got whipped cream. You gotta take a bite with all the layers. You dropped a pea. Well? It's good. Really? How good? It's so good that I feel selfish. . . . . .about being the only one who's eating it. I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross. This is so good that I'm gonna go enjoy it on the balcony. So that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert. I've gotta call my friend. . . . . .and tell her how good this is from Monica's room. I'll help dial. I'm gonna go into the bathroom. . . . . .so I can look at it in the mirror as I eat it. What was that all about? Does it not taste good? -Let me try it. -No, no! All gone! So good. Maybe Chandler has some left. It tastes like feet. I like it! Are you kidding? What's not to like? Custard, good. Jam, good. Meat, good. So a bird just grabbed it. . . . . .and then tried to fly away with it. . . . . .and then just dropped it on the street? If it's any consolation, before the bird dropped it. . . . . .he seemed to enjoy it. Rachel, come here. I was taking my Thanksgiving nap and I had another dream. -Do I want to hear this? -I don't know, let's see. I dreamt we were getting married. . . . . .and he left because he had to go fight a fire. So I went to a nightclub and I saw him making out with a girl. Oh, my God, he dream-cheated on you! But then Jacques Cousteau came. . . . . .and he kicked his ass for betraying me. So cool! Then he took me diving and introduced me to his sea horse. . . . . .who was coming on to me. Please, that is not gonna happen. Boy, I'm glad I wore the big belt today. Five minutes ago, a line like that would have floored me. But now, nothing. Well, not nothing. I am still a woman. Ross? Let's go. Oh, yeah. About telling Mom and Dad. . . . . .I was thinking about maybe writing a letter. That's it. You've had your chance. Mom, Dad. Ross smoked pot in college. You are such a tattletale! Mom, Dad. . . . . .you remember that time you walked in my room. . . . . .and smelled marijuana? Yes. I told you it was Chandler. . . . . .who was smoking the pot but. . . . . .it was me. I'm sorry. It was you? Dad, you know that mailman that you got fired? He didn't steal your Playboys. Ross did. Well, Hurricane Gloria didn't break the porch swing. Monica did! Ross hasn't worked at the museum for a year! Monica and Chandler are living together! Ross married Rachel in Vegas! And got divorced! Again! I love Jacques Cousteau! I wasn't supposed to put beef in the trifle! I want to go! That's a lot of information to get in 30 seconds. All right. Joey, if you want to leave, just leave. Rachel, no, you weren't supposed to put beef in the trifle. It did not taste good. Phoebe, I'm sorry. . . . . .but I think Jacques Cousteau is dead. Monica, why you felt you had to hide the fact. . . . . .that you're in an important relationship is beyond me. And we kind of figured about the porch swing. Ross. Drugs? Divorced again? What happened, son? I got tricked into all those things. Chandler, you've been Ross' best friend all these years. . . . . .stuck by him during the drug problems. . . . . .and now you've taken on Monica as well. Well, I don't know what to say. You're a wonderful human being. -Thank you! -No. Thank you! Monica and Ross, I don't know what I'm gonna do about the two of you. I'll talk to them. You guys, it was bananas. . . . . .cream and beef! I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn't feel bad. Well, actually, I didn't eat mine. It's still in the bathroom. No, I ate that. And we left ours in Monica's bedroom. Nope, got it and got yours too. <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"
610,"Why is everybody using these tiny little lights nowadays? I remember when people used big ones. That's a good story, Grandpa. Wow. Monica's letting other people help decorate her tree? Did someone get her drunk again, or. . .? Having a perfect tree is not what Christmas is about. It's about being with loved ones. That is nice. And we're done. Ta-da! It just doesn't quite feel like Christmas to me. Oh, here. See, now it feels like Christmas. The One With the Routine English Subtitles by Gelula/SDI And that's the story of the dreidel. Some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians. . . . . .who'd bring palm branches into huts on the shortest day of the year. . . . . .symbolizing life's triumph over death. And that was, like, 4000 years ago. So, around the same time that you started telling this story. -Hey, you guys. -Hey. What's up? I had to get out of the apartment. Janine's stretching all over the place. Everywhere I look she's like. . . . I can see why that's hard to resist. I like her so much. I'm sorry she doesn't feel the same. I know. And she's so sweet. I just want to feed her grapes and brush her hair. You are aware that she's not a monkey, right? I am so over Janine. Yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she's like old news. -Hey, guys. -Janine! I'm gonna be a dancer on a TV special for New Year's Eve. It's called some sort of Dickin ' Rockin ' Dicky Eve. Hold it. Are you talking about Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin ' Eve? Yeah, that's what I said. Oh, my God, we love that show! Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember. You're still just a little fat girl inside, aren't you? I'm gonna be one of the party people. You're gonna be a party person? Those guys rock the most! They said to bring someone. Want to be my dance partner? I would love to spend New Year's with you. They're taping tomorrow. I don't understand why-- Well, how it works is. . . . . .the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live. But they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Not a lot of people know that. Do you guys want to come too? -Are you serious? -We are there! What are you laughing at? Well, I used to date him, but you're still going out with her. Thanks. Great, so we can all go together. I gotta run. I'll catch you later. Bye, Janine. Did she just ask me out on a date? I don't think so. She invited him to the biggest party of the millennium. Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. I'm sorry, I don't think that that was a romantic thing. Well, maybe. But, hey, I know how I can find out. It's a New Year's Eve party. So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great. If she says, ""What are you doing?"" I can say, ""It wasn't me, it was New Year's. "" That's better than Ross kissing me in high school. . . . . .and saying that he did it because he needed Chap Stick. It was a dry day. We are going to Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin ' Eve! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Okay, I've been on sets before. . . . . .so let me give you some advice. It's a show, but we're just dancing. It's no big deal. Important thing to remember: Stay cool. -Got it. -Okay. Oh, my God! It's just like I dreamed it! Everyone! Gather up! -Excuse us! -Excuse us! The music's gonna start, you're gonna dance. . . . . .we'll tape it. Don't look at the camera. Questions? Yeah, I have a question. When is this gonna air? Yeah. Now, you guys dance over there. . . . . .you guys, over there. I want you two here. And everyone else, spread out. So when is it gonna air? You look in the kitchen, I got the closet. I can save you time, ladies. I'm right here. Yeah. Why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you. We're looking for our presents from Monica. That's terrible. No, we do it every year. Oh, well, that makes it not terrible. Yeah, we never find them. She's always bested us, that wily. . .minx. We'll search here for an hour. . . . . .and then we'll go to Joey's and search, okay? -You can't look for Monica's presents. -We have to. You don't have to. And you can't, because I live here too. Well, then you should look with us. Why? Aren't you worried about what to get Monica? No, I have a great idea for her present. Oh, that's it? A great idea? Oh, yeah? What if she gets you a great present. . . . . .two mediums and lots of little ones. . . . . .and you just get her one present? She'll feel bad. Why would you do that to her? Why? Why? -If I help, we can find them faster! -Right! We have a live one! -Oh, it's a Macy's bag! -Yeah. Who's it for? ""Dear Losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch? P.S. Chandler, I knew they'd break you. "" Uh-oh. She may be onto us. We are so gonna find them this year. You said you'd go across the hall and look. Do you do that every year? Yeah. You don't go into the back of my closet. . . . . .and look under my gym bag or anything? -No. Never do that. -No. That's where Joey gave me stuff to store that I've never seen. Okay, that did not just happen. Here comes a camera. Right. No biggie. Stay loose. Why do they keep doing that? We have to get up on one of those platforms. They've been taping them all day. Right. What'd you guys do to get up on there? We learned how to dance. When you learned to dance, did you forget how to put on underpants? Yeah! -Hey, you're a good dancer. -Really? You'd be better if you loosened your hips. -What do you mean? -Like this. That's it. Feel the rhythm. That's better. You're dancing with her. -We're together. -Yeah, we came together. I don't see it. You are dancing with the tall guy. Tall Guy, raise your hand! Hey, buddy. Let me dance with her. I like her and I think I have a shot. Really, you think so? I don't. I couldn't find anything-- Hey, wait! Yeah, we found them. They were in the guest room closet. You have nothing to worry about because they're crap. Those are mine. I got those for you. Oh. Thanks, Chandler, they're great! Chandler, what is this very weird metal A-Z thing? Those are bookends. That's a great gift. Oh. Okay, I'm sorry. Thank you for my ""az. "" Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet. Yes, okay. By the way, I think it's really nice of you that even after you moved. . . . . .you still keep storing that stuff for Joey. Hey, dancing girl? Can I go to the bathroom? Here we go. Yeah. Looking good, Gellers! We know! That snippy guy's the one who decides who gets on the platform. -We should go dance by him. -Okay. Okay, everybody, hold! Next on the platforms are. . . . You two! And. . . . -You two! -Cool! Excuse me? Sir? Would it help if I weren't wearing underpants? Would it? Hey, Tall Guy! I want to talk to you about that girl you're dancing with. She's nice, huh? To think I almost brought my wife to this. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Look, I came with that girl, okay? I plan to kiss her at the New Year's countdown. I'm trying to win her over. I-- I don't think so. You can dance with my partner. She's real mellow. Look, you dating this girl you came with? I was hoping after tonight that maybe. . . . No. No. She's fair game if you ask me. Sorry, buddy. All right. Hey. Fair is fair. When you're right, you're right. What can I say? Are you in second grade? Hey, man. You're the one who wet his pants. Man, this sucks. If Mom and Dad don't see us on TV after we made them jealous. . . . . .then who's gonna be the losers then? I know what'll get us up on a platform. What? The routine! We haven't done the routine since middle school. When the snippy guy sees the routine. . . . . .he'll want to build us our own platform. Was it that good? We got honorable mention in the brother/sister dance category! It's almost fake midnight. Do we really have any other choice? Okay, let's do it. Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced! Five, six, seven, eight! So, do we really need to ask who's going up on the platform next? You get up there and do that again, exactly like that. Get this. Dick will want it for the Bloopers show. All right, cut! Listen up, everyone! When we start, it'll be the countdown. . . . . .so I want to see everybody's excitement! Hey, guy! You got three seconds to get away. What's going on here? Take a look at the guy's pants! You told us to show excitement, but don't you think he went overboard? What's the matter with you? Go! Yeah, take a hike, wet pants! Can you believe this? We're on the platform for the millennial moment! I know! You haven't been practicing the routine, have you? No. Me too! When the music starts. . . . . .I was thinking about maybe going into the robot. Ross? We should stick to the routine. We don't want to look stupid. All right, we're back! Ten seconds left. -Ten. -Nine, eight. Seven. Okay, it all comes down to this. Whatever happens, happens. Destiny. --three, two, one! -Cut! -No! --year! Happy No Year! Now we go to the live shot of Times Square. That's a wrap! Hey, look who I found. Oh, hi, guys! Birds have a very good sense of direction. I thought maybe they could help us find the presents. Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter. Or we could just follow your clever jokes. Any ideas? Didn't think so. Come on, show us where the presents are. The duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage. I wonder what I could get Monica that's as good as garbage. How about my ""az""? Hey. This is hollow. What? This bench, it's hollow. I can't believe I never knew that! -Oh, the presents! -Don't look directly at them! What? All right, no, we could look at them. This one's for me! This one's for Chandler. Here. -And the big one's for me! -Oh, let's open them! -Wait a minute. We can't do this. -Why? I don't want to know what Monica got me. I'm sure she worked hard at getting it and wanting to surprise me. And you guys are gonna ruin that. We have to put them back. This isn't what Christmas is about. Whatever, Linus. I'm opening mine. Nobody is opening anything, okay? I want to see the look on her face when I give her my present. I'm sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So, please, please, can we just. . .? Can we put them back? -Will you get us better gifts? -Fine. Hey, guys. You found the presents? You let them find the presents? Great. Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier? -That's what you got me? -Yes, I see. That look is priceless. Home sweet home, huh? Nice to get back to reality. Plus, we know how the New Year's gonna go off. I guess there's no reason for all that Y2K panic, you know? Anyway, good night. -Joey? -Yeah? Three. . . . . .two, one. Happy New Year. What was that for? Tonight when they yelled ""cut"" and we didn't get to kiss. . . . . .I was really, really disappointed, and I just. . . . I just really wanted to kiss you. Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment. -In the moment. -But only in the moment. So do you want to kiss again? Sure. New Year's Eve is only two weeks away. Can you wait? No. Me neither. Three, two. . . . You don't have to count down every time we kiss. Oh. Okay. Except I sort of felt like I needed a couple seconds to get ready. We were on the platform, ready to dance into the new millennium. . . . . .and the guy yells ""cut! "" So you guys are telling me that you actually did. . . . . .the routine from eighth grade? Yeah! But of course we had to update it a little bit. Hey, by the way, quick thinking about catching me. There's no way you could've done the end. . . . . .the way you guys did it back then. What? We could do it. I don't know. You were a lot bigger-- I mean, stronger back then. I can do it, okay? Come on, let's go! Come on. One, two, three, four. . . . . .five, six, seven, eight. I can't do it! Now, you do that, you're on TV. <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"
611,"Listen. . . . You think I have a chance with Janine? We've been through this. Don't do this to yourself. She made it clear it isn't going to happen. All right, then. I guess I shouldn't get too excited. . . . . .that I just kissed her! -Are you serious? -That's great! Yeah, well, we'll see. You kissed her? We kissed it up real nice. So you kissed. Then what happened? I came over here to tell you guys. So she's waiting over there for you? Yeah. The One With The Apothecary Table English Subtitles by Gelula/SDI -I gotta go. -Okay. I'm gonna be late for dance class. Okay. -Okay, now I'm really leaving. -All right. But can you just. . . . . .just leave your lips? Have you kissed her yet? It's awesome! I could do it forever. You know what? She kisses better than my mom cooks. I'm so glad you said ""cooks. "" Rachel, you've got to tell the post office that you've moved. We still get your bills and stuff. Pottery Barn! You can throw the rest away. I'm not your garbage man. I'm your mailman. Monica, look. Here is that table that I ordered. -You got it from Pottery Barn? -Yeah. It's an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what an apothecary is? A pharmacist. ""A pharmacist. "" Phoebe hates Pottery Barn. I hate Pottery Barn too. They kicked me out just because I sat on a bed. You took off your pants and got under the sheets. I was tired. Phoebe hates Pottery Barn? She hates mass-produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should have a story behind it. This has a story behind it. They had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store. It's got to be one-of-a-kind. Like that God-awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter? Hey! I made that for her. -You made pottery? -Yeah. I made it out of a fruit bowl I found in the garbage. If you put that in her apartment, you'll never hear the end of it. I'll tell her that it's an antique. She doesn't have to know where it came from. I love these little drawers. Oh, look! It says that it holds 300 CDs. Just like the apothecary tables of yore. So the farmer says: ""That's not a cow, and you're not milking. "" I'm so glad you're together. We wanted a couple to go out with and now we have one. We're a couple of couples. I had so much fun tonight. What a great restaurant! And Chandler, I can't believe I let you pay for this one. Thanks again, man. If you come over tomorrow, I'll make pasta. -That'd be great! -Okay. But at least let us bring the wine. -You don't have to. -I insist. -You'll get the wine, right? -Yeah. -Okay, good night. -See you tomorrow. Can't wait. How are we going to get out of that one? I can't handle two nights in a row with them. What's wrong with them? They're just a little. . . . . .blah! Blah? Well, you know, he's blah. She's just. . . . She's very loud for such a small person. They're my best friends. Are you saying we can't go out? 'Cause that'd be a problem. Of course we can still hang out with them. Just not two nights in a row. -Okay? -I guess. Thank you. I'll sell my friends and use the money to buy you presents. What a great table! Where did you get it? Guess. A flea market? I knew you would get it on the first guess. Isn't it cool? It's an apothecary table. You can just imagine that this is where. . . . . .they kept all their stuff to make potions. You can almost smell the opium. Almost. How much was it? Just only 500 bucks. 500 bucks at a flea market? I thought you meant how much was it. . . . . .when it was new, back then. It was at a flea market, so it was like a dollar. -A dollar? -And fifty? So it was like one and fifty dollars. -They gave you the old-time pricing. -Yeah. Well, what period is it from? It's from yore. Like, the ""days of yore,"" you know? Yes, I do. -It's just perfect. -Oh, good. I bet it has a great story too. Did they tell you where it's from or. . . . Yes, that I know. This is from White Plains. White Plains. It sounds like such a magical place. -I'm here. -Hi! Oh, my God! -You like it? -Oh, my God! It's my new apothecary table! Phoebe'll be here any second. She can't see this. Why not? She'll love it. It's the real thing. I got it at Pottery Barn. I know. I bought the same one. And if she sees your table, she'll know I lied. -I said ours was an original. -Why? Because she hates Pottery Barn. She hates Pottery Barn? She says it's all mass-produced. . . . . .nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff. So come on! Can we cover this up, please? I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe. Although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets. I forgot they made sheets! I still can't believe she hates Pottery Barn. It's not like she hates you. Yeah, but Pottery Barn? You know what I think? She's just weird. It's because she's a twin. Twins are weird. She's not weird. She likes her stuff to be one-of-a-kind. You know what's not one-of-a-kind? A twin! Let's turn out the lights and watch the movie. -Hey, cool sheet! -You like it? -You want to know where I got it? -Sure. At a flea market. You buy your sheets at a flea market? Come on, you gotta loosen the purse strings a little. Dinner will be ready in 20 minutes. Here is the wine to bring over tonight. You were also gonna buy Monica flowers. . . . . .but you couldn't because you paid for dinner last night. Thanks. But it's just gonna be me tonight. -What happened to Janine? -She's really sick. -That's too bad. -Yeah, she's been in there all day. High fever, nose problem. It's. . . . . .phlegm, phlegm, phlegm, phlegm, phlegm. Monica! Chandler! I'm sorry about tonight. I don't know if Joey told you. . . . . .but I couldn't get out of going to this play. Have a great time, huh? That's funny, I saw no phlegm. Oh, no, she really is sick. Then why is she going to a play? Well, you know, ""Starve a fever. . . . . .go to a play for a cold. "" Why is Janine not coming over for dinner? She didn't want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. I'm so sorry. Why doesn't she want to hang out with us? Because she thinks that you are ""blah. "" And that you, Monica, are too loud. What?! What? So she just pretended to have a good time? She was lying to our faces? I can't believe this. Who is she to judge us? -We couldn't have been nicer to her. -And I am not ""blah. "" I am a hoot! Come on, please, you guys. Don't be mad. I'm sure she said it. . . . . .because she was nervous 'cause you're my best friends. And it was our first date. Plus, she's really sick. You said you made that up! But isn't the ""sick"" thing better than the ""play"" thing? They're both good. I generally just go with, ""Monica's drunk again. "" Come on, please just give her another chance. -She'll come around, I promise. -Of course we will. -Come on, we gotta make dinner. -Okay. I do not like that woman! I can hear you! I am loud! Can you please not put your feet up on my new. . . . . .old sheet. Oh, sure. My apothecary table! -What? -No! -Where did you get this? -At Pottery Barn, okay? Oh, my God! Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our antique! If they've ripped off our table. . . . . .ours must be worth much more than one and fifty dollars. This doesn't even smell like opium. It smells like wine, which you spilled. And thanks for wrecking my sheet. Ross, calm down. I'll give you the 80 cents. Okay, one more time. Would you like some orange juice? -Perfect decibel. -I know! What are you guys doing? Nothing. We're just talking. You know, blah-blah-blah. Come on, you said you were gonna try. I came over to invite you to a movie with me and Janine. -What do you say? -I'd like to. . . . . .but I'm not sure if we have the time. Very funny. I don't know what to do. I really want you to get along. Please, come to the movie with us. You owe me. -We owe you? -That's right. I helped you out in the start of your relationship. I helped you sneak around for six months. I looked like an idiot. And I was humiliated. And I only made $200. We didn't give you any money. You don't think I know that? I can't decide if it goes better by the new chair. . . . . .the Sahara desk. . . . . .or the Parker console table. I didn't know there was a Pottery Barn up here. -I know, I went a little crazy. -A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalog. Look at that! The ornamental birdcage! Large. Oh, Ross? Be careful. That is very old. Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that. Fascinating. Another amazing find! -I bet this has a great story too. -It does. It is a room-separating apparatus from Colonial times. A lot of this stuff is from the Colonial times. What are some other time periods, Rachel? Well, there's yore. And, you know, yesteryear. Rachel has such a good eye for this stuff. Ross, if you ever decide to redecorate-- --and I think you should-- --you should ask Rachel to help. He doesn't need my help. I think he's ready to get rid of the-- What'd you call it? The ""cheap knockoffs and dinosaur junk""? Really? You know, since you have such a great sense of what I need-- Here's 60 bucks. Why don't you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market. . . . . .and get me some stuff? I don't think Phoebe wants to come. -I do want to. -She does want to. -She does want to. -Yeah! I guess the flea market was just better last time. Well, at least I got these sheets for Ross. Ugh, look at this. Pottery Barn. You know what? Don't look at it. -Seriously, don't look at it. -Look! There's the table they stole from us. Oh, those bastards! Let's go. That fan kind of looks like ours, and the birdcage, and. . . . Wait a second, this is our exact living room! No, it's not. Come on, ours is totally different. I mean, we don't have the-- We don't have that lamp. And that screen is on the other side. Oh, my God. This is where you got all our stuff. Pottery Barn! Oh, my God! Okay, I did, all right? I'm sorry. I wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn. -Come on, don't be mad. -No, but I am mad. Because this stuff is what's wrong with the world. . . . . .and it's in my living room. . . . . .and all I can think about is how I don't have that lamp! Well, then, honey, buy the lamp. We have that 60 bucks from Ross. I can't! I can't! Unless. . . . Are you saying you'd move out if I didn't buy that lamp? No, I'm not gonna move out! But are you saying that you would move out if I didn't buy that lamp? -Yes! I would so move out. -Then I don't have a choice. -I have to buy that lamp! -That's right. But at least the apothecary table's real. This was great. Didn't everybody have a great time? I did. I really did. And I've got to say. . . . . .I'm sorry if I was weird after the last time we went out. I guess I was just nervous. -That's understandable. -Don't worry about it. So we can go out again? -Absolutely. -Well, good. See? Wasn't that fun? We have got to move. What? I knew it! You're not so quiet yourself, missy! I'm blah? The only thing more boring than modern dance. . . . . .is you talking about it. ""Oh, Chandler, I just lost myself in the movement. "" You know, I know you're talking. . . . . .but all I hear is blah-blah-blah-blah-blah. All right, you and me! Let's go, right now! All right, enough! Enough! You two, go home. I gotta talk to Janine. I really think you could take her. You better hope I don't see you in the hallway! All right. Look, we got a little bit of a problem here. You can't my treat my friends that way. -They said stuff to me too. -I know, I'll talk to them about it. They mean so much to me. They're like my family, you know? If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time. . . . I don't think we can be together. It just can't work, okay? It can't. I'm very upset. Okay. Would it help if I apologized? Yeah. That'd be very helpful. What did I tell you about the hall? I was coming over to apologize for my behavior. I'd really like it if we could be friends. Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so. . . . . .I would like that too. -Great. -Now, come on. -I'm glad we worked it out. -Me too. -I'll see you. -Bye. -Or I'll hear you. -That's it, big girl! Wait! You'd better run! Did you hear that? -What am I gonna do? -I'm sorry, man. -Want to go watch? -Yeah! -How you doing? -So did she move out? Pretty much. I can't believe you just broke up with her. When it's not right, you know it. -You okay? -I'll be all right. -You know what'd cheer you up? -What? I'm giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night. I think you should come. You're right, that did cheer me up. <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"
612,"Hey! You're not gonna believe this. I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy. They printed it. I didn't know they print jokes. They print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It's not just about the pictures. Didn't work on Mom, it's not gonna work on us. Check it out. It's the first one. Right there. That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up. -What? -I made that joke up. No, you didn't. I did. Yes, I did. I told Dan and he said it was the funniest he'd joke ever heard. Hey, tell Dan thanks. What? I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is funny. Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right? -No. -Seriously? You tell a lot of jokes. Look, it's my joke. But if it makes you feel better, they don't print the name. So it doesn't really matter who gets credit. Yeah, I guess. -Hey, guys. -Playboy printed my joke! No, it's mine! Call them! They'll tell you! -My joke! -My joke! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Jokes? What. . .? You know there's naked chicks in there, right? The One With The Joke English Subtitles by Gelula/SDI Dude! You have got to turn on Behind The Music. The band Heart is having a tough time and they may break up. Let's watch that at your place. Monica's watching a show. I don't want to miss when they were skinny. Hey, Chandler? You know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses. What? No, I want to watch this. -Did your cable go out? -No. No, that's VH1 . I tell you, the music these kids listen to today. . . . . .it's a lot of noise to me. Why is your cable out? Oh, because I haven't really paid the bill. If you need money, would you please let me loan you some? No, Chandler. Forget about it, okay? I know things have been tight since Janine moved out. God, was she hot. I know, yeah. Look, I can handle it, all right? I can listen to the radio. And Ross gave me this great book. Want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch at his place? Sure. -Paid your phone bill? -No. It's only you. -What are you doing? -Looking at a Playboy. I want to look too! Yikes! Do you think these pictures are trying to tell a story? Sure. Like in the case of this young woman. . . . . .she has lost her clothes. So she rides naked on the horse, she's crying out, ""Where are they?"" She's not gonna find them, lying in the grass like that. Remember the days when you'd go out to the barn. . . . . .Iift up your shirt and bend over? You see, now, I would date this girl. She's cute, she's outdoorsy. And she knows how to build a fire. That'll come in handy. I got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be? -I don't know. -Me neither. Rachel. What? I don't know. Me neither. You know, you forget how many great songs Heart had. ""Barracuda"" was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard. So you heard it, you repeated it. . . . . .so that must mean you wrote it. You guys with this joke. Well, I gotta say. . . . . .I know I cracked up, but I'm not even sure I got it. What? You didn't get it? The doctor is a monkey. And monkeys can't write out prescriptions. You are not allowed to laugh at my joke. Your joke? Well, I think the Hef would disagree. Which is why he sent me a check. . . . . .for $1 00. So you stole my joke and you stole my money? I was gonna stick it in the ATM. But now I think I'll show the sexy teller. . . . . .that I am a published writer. She'll know that you stole the joke. You gonna follow me there? -Yeah. -I'm not gonna go now. Okay. Here you go. Gunther? I can't pay now, because I'm not working. I've had to cut down on some luxuries like. . . . . .paying for stuff, so. . . . Well, if you want, you can work here. I don't know. It's just. . . . See, I was a regular on a soap opera, you know? And to go from that to this, it's just. . . . And plus, I'd have to wait on all my friends. Okay. But the money's good. Plus, you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want. What? Flexible hours. Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone? She picked Rachel. She tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel. He took my joke. He just took it. This is wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel. Know who else picked Rachel? Ross. Know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. I'm gonna get a joke journal, you know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes. Good idea. Know what's a bad idea? -Picking Rachel. -That's right. Did you hear something? Maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing into my brain to steal my thoughts. It's coming from the living room. I finished my book. -Hey, you guys. -Hey. Don't you guys look cute. You guys make a cute couple. What are you doing? Just trying to re-create some of the fun that we had at my place. Remember? When you picked Rachel over me? That was funny. -It was kind of funny. -It wasn't funny at all! Why would you do that? Why didn't you pick me? Fine. The reason I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you. . . . . .is just, you know, you're. . . . . .high maintenance. Let's go to lunch! That is completely untrue. You think I'm high maintenance? Prove it. You write out a list, and we'll go through it point by point. No, you're right, you're easygoing. You're just not as easygoing as Rachel. She's just more. . . . . .flexible and mellow. That's all. Well, people are different. Rachel will do whatever you want. You can just walk all over her. What? Are you saying that I'm a pushover? I'm not a pushover. Oh, okay. You're not a pushover. You think I'm a pushover. Well, watch this. You're not invited to lunch! What do you think? Pretty strong, I think. Come on, Monica, let's go to lunch. You start working on that list. -I cannot believe her. -I know. Where do you want to eat? -Oh, I love that Japanese place. -I'm sick of Japanese. Not there. Wherever you want to go is cool. Oh, hey, Gunther. . . . . .check this out. Yeah, that Chandler cracks me up. You want anything to drink? I'm heading up there. -I'll take a coffee. Thanks. -Sure. -Coffee? -No. Coffee? I'm going up there. No, thank you. You need anything? I'm heading up there. I'd love ice water. You got it. What are you doing? Just being friendly. You're not supposed to go back there. It's okay. Right? Don't wink at me. And put on your apron. Okay. I don't see you asking other paying customers to put on aprons. -Joey, do you work here? -No. -Waiter. -Yeah! What's going on? Why didn't you tell us you work here? It's kind of embarrassing. I mean, I was an actor, now I'm a waiter. It's supposed to go the other direction. So's your apron. You're wearing it like a cape. I mean, the job's easy and the money's good, you know? I guess if I'm hanging out here, I might as well get paid for it. I just feel kind of weird serving you guys, you know? It'll be great. Come on, I did it and it was fine. Why would it be weird? Hey, Joey? Can I get some coffee? It doesn't seem that weird. I asked before. You still haven't gotten it. See, now it's weird again. You're gonna make a lot of money. Here's your first tip. Don't eat yellow snow. 2: 1 5, coffeehouse. This is great. Finally, someone I can pass my wisdom to. Let me tell you some things I learned working here. First, the customer is always right. A smile goes a long way. And if anyone is ever rude to you, sneeze muffin. Thanks, Rach. Hey, look, you guys are just terrific, you know? How about clearing out so I can get some new customers? It's all about turnover. Seriously, can I get my coffee? I'm sorry. I'll get it right now. And since you waited, I'll toss in a free muffin. Phoebe, we'd like to talk to you. Okay. So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what you are? We are sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky. That's true, I am flaky. So, what, you're just okay with being flaky? Yeah, totally. Then I'm okay with being high maintenance. Yeah. And I am okay with being a pushover. That's great. Good for you guys. -I am not high maintenance! -I am not a pushover! -Who said you were? -You did! I'm flaky. I'll say anything. Hey, Gunther. Can you cover for me? I got an audition. No, I'm leaving to get my hair dyed. I like your natural color. It's a great part. I'm the lead guy's best friend. I wait for him and save his seat. Listen. ""I'm sorry, that seat's saved. "" -That's the whole part? -Maybe he's not his best friend. I'll see you. Oh, man. I could totally get that part. ""I'm sorry, this seat is taken. "" -Excuse me. -No, I didn't mean you. But you believed me? I believed you were saving this seat for someone. So you'd hire me, right? For what? Exactly! All right, everybody listen up! The coffeehouse will be closed for about an hour. What? It's for the kids. Yeah, to keep the kids off drugs. It's a very important issue in this month's Playboy. I'm sure you all read about it. -It's my joke. -It's my joke. It's my joke. I don't think we're gonna settle this. Let's have Monica decide. -Hey, Mon! -Get out here! -Monica? -Okay. You have to decide whose joke this is. Why do I have to? You're the only one that can be fair. I can't be. You're my boyfriend. But I'm your brother. We're family. That's the most important thing in the world. Don't try to sway her. I'm your only chance to have a baby. -Okay, let's go. -All right. We'll each tell you how we came up with the joke. . . . . .then you decide which one of us is telling the truth. Me. Chandler, you first. I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve. -Did I meet him at Christmas? -Can I finish? You want me to pick you? See, I would never snap at you like that. Two babies. -Continue. -Okay. Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And his doctor's name is Dr. Mompey. I said, ""Dr. Monkey?"" And that is how the whole Dr. Monkey thing came up. Are you kidding? Okay, look, I study evolution. Remember? Evolution. Monkey into man. Plus, I'm a doctor. And. . . . . .I had a monkey. I'm Dr. Monkey! I'm not arguing with that. I've heard enough for my decision. -Okay, so what--? -Do tell. You are both idiots. It's not funny. And it's offensive to women. And doctors. And monkeys. You shouldn't argue over who gets credit. You should argue over who gets blamed for inflicting this joke on the world. Now, let it go. The joke sucks. -It's your joke. -It is not. -Oh, my God, Chandler, there you are. -Hi. Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel. Why don't you tell them. . . . . .what you told me about me not being high maintenance. Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady. Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance. . . . . .is merely attention to detail. . . . . .and. . . . . .generosity of spirit. Wow. You know what? That is the best fake speech I think I've ever heard. Really? I've heard better. Wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them. I'm out of words. Should I say it again? Look, I am not high maintenance! I am not. Chandler! You're a little high maintenance. You are on my list! Look, I'm sorry, but you're not-- You're not easygoing, but you're passionate. And that's good. And when you get upset about little things, I think I'm pretty good. . . . . .at making you feel better. That's good too. They say you're high maintenance. . . . . .but it's okay, because I like. . . . . .maintaining you. I didn't tell him that. -You're off my list. -I'm off the list. Phoebe? It's okay that you don't want me to be your girlfriend. I have the best boyfriend. You know, suddenly I find you very attractive. How'd the audition go? Oh, not good. No. I didn't get the part. And I lost my job here, so. . . . Wow, that is a bad audition. Well, how did you lose your job here? I had the audition. . . . . .but Gunther said I had to stay so he could get his hair dyed. So I went anyway, and he fired me. He left work to do a personal errand. . . . . .and left you in charge when you've been here two days? That's not right. What are you gonna do? You can't let him get away with that. I won't let him get away with that. I'm gonna say-- I shouldn't say anything. No, I should say something! Gunther? I want you to give Joey his job back. -It's not fair that you have to fire-- -Okay. -What? -He can have his job back. That's right, he can have his job back. Glad we got that all straightened out. There you go, Joey. -Got your job back. -That's great. Thanks. Pretty nice, huh? Now who's a pushover? -Rach, you're in my seat. -I'm sorry. I never heard who you'd pick to be your girlfriend. -I'd pick you, Phoebe. -Yeah, definitely you, Pheebs. Yeah, I kind of thought. -Never. -It would totally be you. If you had to pick one of the other two to go out with. . . . . .who would you pick? -No way. -I'm not answering. Joey. No way, I'm not answering that. <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"
613,"Okay, Rach, that's muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75. Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1 .25. All together that's $1 2.75. This coming from the man who couldn't split our $80 phone bill in half. How much do I owe you? That's on the house, courtesy of Joey Tribbiani. Great. Well, tell him thanks. And since Joey seems like such a nice guy. . . . . .maybe we could go out? He's not used to women being so forward. . . . . .but I could check with him. He says it's okay. Great. Thanks. Bye-bye. How come our stuff isn't free? It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt. I'm getting more dates than ever. You're only giving free stuff to the pretty girls? Joey, that is so gross! How about a scone on the house, baby? I'm pretty. The One With Rachel's Sister English Subtitles by Gelula/SDI -Hey, does anyone have any gum? -I do. Here. Sorry. Oh, you know what? No. Wait a second. -I know it's in here. -You know what? I'm good. Why are you here? Shouldn't you be at work? They sent me home. They said I can't work if I'm sick. -Sorry you're sick. -I'm not sick! I don't get sick. Getting sick is for weaklings, it's for pansies. No one thinks that you're a pansy. . . . . .but we do think that you need a tissue. I have not been sick in over three years. I'll get tissue. I don't need a tissue. I'm fine-d. When you put a ""D"" at the end of fine. . . . . .you're not fine. I'm fine-d. I'm fine-d. It's a really hard word to say. -Yes? -Hi. Is Rachel here? I'm her sister. Oh, my God, Jill! Oh, my God, Rachel! Oh, my God, introduce us. This is Chandler. And you know Monica and Ross. And that's Phoebe. And that's Joey. -How you doing? -Don't! Honey, what are you doing here? Which sister is this? Is this the spoiled one or the one that bit her? Daddy cut me off. Never mind, I got it. You know what I said? I said, ""I'll hire a lawyer, sue you, take all your money. . . . . .and cut you off! "" Wow. What did he say? That he wouldn't pay for my lawyer. Then he told me to learn the value of money. . . . . .from the one daughter he's actually proud of. Did you hear that? My dad's proud of me. My dad's proud of me. -Rach? -Oh, yeah. Sorry. Honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you off? Okay, I bought a boat. You bought a boat? It wasn't for me, it was for a friend. Boy, did we make friends with the wrong sister. This is the best thing that could've happened to you. You've needed to get out on your own. When I did it, at first I was scared, but then look at me now. I am the only daughter that Dad is proud of. This is what you'll do. You're gonna get a job. You're gonna get an apartment. And you can stay with us. Right, Pheebs? Of course, yeah. Oh, that's so great! Okay, I'm really gonna do this. I don't know how to thank you. Oh, I like cars. -You all finished? -Yes. Great. Okay, here are the tips for this morning. Jen gets 50, 50 for me and Joey owes eight dollars. -What? -For all the free food you gave away. If it's free, how come you're charging me for it? Don't give anything away unless it's a birthday. What if they came in third in a modeling contest? No. Sorry. I just had the hardest day. Some of these are so heavy. How did you pay? I thought your dad took your credit card. I memorized those numbers when I was 1 5. But look at all the cool make-it-on-my-own stuff I got! This is my ""Please, hire me"" sweater. And these are my ""Don't you want to rent me this apartment?"" pants. Charging clothes to your dad doesn't qualify as making it on your own. Oh, Mr. Scientist has to get all technical. Rachel's not gonna think it's a good idea. -So who made her queen of the world? -I would love that job! What's going on? Jill! Did you shop? No. They did. Yeah, we went shopping! You went shopping? Then you came here and paraded it under Jill's nose. . . . . .when you know she's trying to quit. That's terrible. Sorry, Jill. So what'd you get? Oh, well, all right. Thank you. I got this, you know, ""I want a job"" sweater. And then I got. . . . These are apartment pants. Apartment pants? You never heard of them? Of course, I've heard of them. Ross, what'd you get? I got this. . . . This. -A Pashmina? -Yeah! I love these babies. Really? What's a Pashmina? It's a rug. Jill? I'm sorry, Rachel. You think that's gonna work on me? I invented that. Right! But I am sorry. It's okay. One little setback is okay. But don't let it happen again, okay? Okay. Now, since Daddy paid for all this stuff, I should take it all away. But I'm just gonna take the Pashmina. And the pants. I'll take it all, because that way, you'll learn the lesson. Alrighty. I'm gonna run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner. She took all my stuff. Yeah. Everything but the little blue one. That's the best one! Oh, my God. Thank you so much! Well, hey. Oh, my gosh, that was so lame. Like a Pashmina could be a rug. Oh, yeah? How about you with the ""I'm sorry. "" Shut up! I wasn't like that at all. What about what I said about the apartment pants. How dumb was l? -Were you this cute in high school? -Oh, stop. -No, you stop. -No, you stop. Why don't I sit here and then you'll both stop it. Okay, so what do you want to do? Let's do something crazy. I know, let's rest and drink lots of fluids. Okay, I'll rest. But if I'm going to bed, then you're coming with me. See, that would be impossible to resist if you weren't all. . . . . .drippy here. Are you saying that you don't want to get with this? I don't think you should say that even when you're healthy. Come on. Don't take this personally. I just can't have sex with a sick person. I'm with you. I can't have sex with a sick person either. Disgusting! But I'm not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the prime of life. See, that's the thing, I would like to stay in the ""prime of lime. "" What's up? I think there's something you should know. It better not be about the apartment pants. I just pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren and she loved it. No. It's just, I was. . . . I was with Ross and Jill after you left. . . . . .and I'm pretty sure I saw a little spark between them. -What? -I mean, it's probably nothing. But I wanted to warn you that there might be something. -With Ross and Jill? -Yeah. With Ross and my sister? With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross? -Oh, there is no way. -Okay, then. Oh, my God! I cannot believe that! I don't like it when he dates anyone, but my sister? Isn't that incest or something? And they're gonna have sex. Oh, no! What if he marries her too? This is just terrible. This is just terrible. And I can't stop it. I don't own Ross. And Jill should be able to do what she wants to do. Oh, my God, I can't believe Ross is marrying my little sister. This is the worst thing that could've ever happened to me. But great news about the apartment pants, huh? That'll be $3.85. What? Yesterday you said I was too pretty to pay. It's just, I can't, because my manager said that l-- Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you -Happy birthday, dear Annie-- -Amy! --Amy Happy birthday to you That's weird, today's my birthday too. Not in here it isn't. Sorry I'm late. What's up? I just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front. No. But I walked past three sales and didn't go in. How strong am l? That is great. You know who doesn't have to job-hunt? Ross. -He works at the university. -Yeah? So you guys talked? So you get along? So you're gonna go out? Me go out with Ross? No. God, no. What would make you think that? Phoebe. . . . . .said she thought she saw something between you guys. I mean, he's nice. He's the kind you're friends with, but not the kind you date. He's the kind you date, because you did. But me? Not so much. Oh, not so much? What do you mean? ls there something wrong with Ross? No, no, no. He's just. . . . I don't know. You know, he's just a little bookish. Are you saying he's a geek? You think so too? No. Ross is not a geek. Then let's just say he's not my type. Handsome is not your type? Smart, kind, good kisser. What, those things aren't on your list? Ross is great. You'd be lucky to be with him. If it means that much, then I'll ask him out. Oh, no. That's not what I meant. You know what? You're right. He has been really nice to me. Yeah, but he's not your type. But maybe that's good. I'm doing all these different things. Maybe I should just try dating a geek too. Yeah, but you don't want to try too much too fast. You remember what happened to the little girl who. . . . . .tried too much too fast, don't you? What? She died, Jill. Chandler! What is it, honey? You need some tea? Some soup? Calling Dr. Big. Dr. Big to the bed. Geez, honey, I thought you were asleep. How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room? I was asleep. No, honey. You know what's sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy. And hot water bottles are sexy. Get into bed. I want to prove I'm not sick. I want to make you feel as good as I feel. Would you please get some rest? I'm fine. Happy birthday to you -You're paying for that. -No, it's her birthday. You've sung ""Happy Birthday"" to 20 women today. You are no longer authorized to distribute birthday muffins. Damn it! Did you tell your sister to ask me out? -Well, yeah. -Oh, wow! I mean, wow. I think she's cute, but. . . . . .I never would've thought of going out with her. Never! Really? But after your okay, I figured, ""Why not?"" Oh, so not really ""never. "" I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean, after all we've been through. I wish I had a brother to reciprocate. If you ever date Monica, you have my blessing. And mine. Chandler? I think I'm sick. Really? Struck down in the ""pribe of libe. "" Okay, fine, I admit it. I feel terrible. Will you please rub this on my chest? No, no, no. You are not getting me this way.

Is it the rubbing or the smell? It's all very, very good. So, you want to go. . . . . .mix it up? -Not now, I'm sick. -Oh, come on, you big faker! What about never sleeping with sick people? Well, that was before all the vaporizing action. Okay, if you really want to have sex. Worked like a charm. Why are you here? This is where Ross and I are meeting for our date. So, what do you think? I don't like it. -Really? -It's kind of slutty. It's yours. Yeah, well, I'm a slut. Me too. Hi, Jill. Hi. . . . Rachel. You're not at home, you're right here. Yeah, I know. And I bet you thought it would be weird. But it's not. Okay. So, well, I'll. . . . I'll have her home by midnight. Why aren't you home yet? Is someone there? Oh, yeah, it's me. Sorry. What are you doing here? I'm just looking out your window. . . . . .at the view. What are you guys doing? We got some Vapor Rub in some places. He brought her back to his apartment. Who? Is that your sister? She is a slut! Ross is on a date with your sister. How weird is that? Oh, my God, he's taking off her clothes! He's taking off her coat. Oh, this is just terrible.

They shut the drapes two hours ago. I didn't know we could date your sister. We know you steal our food. I'm good. Drapes still closed? Yeah.

It was fun. It was fun? Great. So did you guys hit it off? I guess so. So did anything happen? Rumor has it you guys shut the drapes. No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to show her slides of my favorite fossils. Oh, slides! So really nothing happened. Something could've happened. She really dug my slides. And she was definitely giving me the vibe.

Want me to call her now? Oh, no. No, no, no. No. Come on, I mean, that's crazy. So, what's going on with you? Well. . . . I may teach another class this semester. Do it now. Call her now. -This is my favorite part. -Me too. You know what's sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for three days with that movie. No, two. The third day my mom killed herself, so I was partly crying for that. Well, that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon. You didn't cry when Bambi's mother died? Yes, it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer. It's okay to cry. You don't have to be macho all the time. I'm not macho. Yeah, you're right. I don't know what I was thinking. I just never really cried. I'm not a crying kind of guy. Come on, there's gotta be something that gets you choked up. Like. . . . What if you saw a three-legged puppy? I'd be sad, sure. But I wouldn't cry. What if the puppy said, ""Help me, Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me. "" Cry? I just found a talking puppy. I'm rich! I've got it. I have got it. Pictures from your childhood. This'll get you going good. Oh, what's going on there? Parents' Day. First grade. That's me with the janitor, Martin. -Where are your parents? -They didn't want to come. -Chandler! -Poor thing. That story doesn't make you cry? No. Look, I don't cry. It's not a big deal, okay? No! It's not okay! It's not okay at all! You're dead inside! -Excuse me? -Yeah? -Are you Phoebe Buffay? -Yeah. Can I get your autograph? I'm your biggest fan. My biggest fan? I've always wanted to meet you. Sure. Yeah. Wow. Wow, thanks a lot. I just want to say I think you're really talented. You're just saying that because you're my biggest fan. Take good care of that guy. He's a fan. Bye. So you saw me on Days of Our Lives, huh? You want me to do a little Doctor Drake Ramoray for you? I have no idea what you're talking about. But I just got Phoebe Buffay's autograph. Oh. You're Phoebe's fan. Oh, yeah. I've seen all her movies. Movies? That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star. I don't think so. No, it was. She was in Sex Toy Story Two... ...Lawrence of a Labia. And I got her autograph. The guys at the comic book store won't believe this. Gunther? Don't let that guy in here anymore. He said Phoebe's a porn star. Well, I wouldn't call her a star, but she's really good. You should check out lnspect Her Gadget. -Hey. -Hey. Ross just totally blew me off, and he didn't even tell me why. Oh, well. The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will just love at work, named Bob. He's a real up-and-comer in Human Resources. Thanks, but I'm not gonna date some random guy from your work. Not random. Bob. It's probably because I'm not mature enough or smart enough. . . . Maybe he doesn't like the way I dress. No, that can't be it. It's gotta be the smart thing. I'm so stupid. I'm just this, like, incredibly pretty, stupid girl. No, honey. Okay. Okay. You want to know why Ross canceled the date? Because I asked him to. You asked him to? -Why? -Because you are my sister. . . . . .and Ross and I have this huge history. You want to go out with Ross? No. You don't want him, but you don't want me to? You know, Bob in Human Resources. . . . I can't believe you did this! You had me doubting how smart I was! You had me doubting my fashion sense! It's not that big a deal. Just don't date Ross. There's other-- You have no right to tell me what to do. I'm not telling you what to do. I am telling you what not to do! Why are you so jealous of me? This is not about me being jealous. It's about you being a brat, wanting what you can't have. Can't have? Excuse me. The only thing I can't have is dairy! Well, you just blew your chances at dating Bob! -Who? -With Human Resources! Jealous of her? Who does she think she is, Princess Caroline? -You're jealous of Princess Caroline? -Do I have my own castle? Hey. -Phoebe's not here, is she? -No. Did you get a movie? Yeah. Yeah. But I don't think it's the kind you're gonna like. Not more movies that'll have us reaching for the tissues all night? Sort of. What's going on? Phoebe's a porn star! -What? -Yeah! What are you talking about? ""Phoebe Buffay in Buffay The Vampire Layer. "" That's Phoebe. Where did you get that? At the adult video place on Bleecker. And I saw Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him. . . . . .to surprise him. Then I pretended that I didn't know he was in there. Wow. I mean, I just can't believe this. I mean, you think you know someone. Even Phoebe, who's always been somewhat of a question mark. This is so bizarre. I guess it makes sense. She had such a terrible childhood. I had a bad childhood and I don't do porn. Yes, but you're dead inside. I'd better take that back. What, why? Why? We can't watch it. It's Phoebe. We shouldn't watch this. Absolutely not. That goes back. -Maybe a bit. -The first half? This is wrong, you guys! Phoebe's our friend! -I'm not gonna watch it. -Yeah! Good for you, Joe. I thought I'd find you here, Nosferatool. Are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places? Actually, I was kind of hoping it would be the other way around. What's that on her ankle? Her ankle is what you're watching? Well, it's hard to tell. God, if she would just stop moving. She's just doing her job. You sick bastards! It's a tattoo. That's weird. Phoebe doesn't-- Wait, that's Ursula! That's not Phoebe! That is Ursula! Wait, wait! I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it! Hey. What's up? Oh, my God! What am I doing?! Hey, sweetie. ""Chicken Soup for the Soul""? There's no back to this couch. You hate this kind of stuff. I figured I'd give it a shot. One of the stories may make me cry, then you won't think I'm dead inside. Oh, that's so sweet. I don't care if you can't cry. I love you. Oh, that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest. Stop it. Seriously. We get married, I'm up at the altar and I'm like this: I won't care. I know that you'll be feeling it all in here. -Yeah? -Yeah. And if we have a baby one day. . . . . .and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room. . . . . .and you don't cry, so what? If we take him to college and go home. . . . . .and we see his empty room for the first time. . . . . .and you got nothing? It won't matter to me. Okay. I won't worry about this anymore then. And then, you know, if I die. . . . . .from a long illness. . . . . .and you're writing my eulogy. . . . . .and you open the desk drawer and find a note from me that says: ""I will always be with you"" . . . . . .and you still can't shed one tiny tear? I know you'll be crying a river inside. -I love you. -What is wrong with you?! -What? -What? You can't shed a tear for your dead wife? I left you a note from the beyond! -So you didn't mean any of that? -No, you robot! You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time and I swear-- Oh, Jill! That's a game I play with the kids down the hall. They've really taken a liking to me. What's the matter? Rachel and I had a big fight. Can I come in? I know we're not supposed to see each other anymore. I don't know anybody in this city and I need somebody to talk to. Sure. What happened? I don't want to talk about it. Okay. -You know what might cheer me up? -What? Seeing some more of your super cool slides. -Wow, really? -Totally. I loved them. You could finish telling me about the different kinds of sand. I'd love to. Wait right here, I'll go get the projector and my notes. Thanks. You're such a good friend. Have you guys seen Jill? I can't find her. -No. -Is Ross home? Maybe I'll call him and see if he's seen her-- Who is it? It's Phoebe. . . . . . ""Phoebe! "" Hey! Oh, God! So you're making porn movies. No, I'm not. We're still rolling! You're making one right now! Let's go, Phoebe. And you're using my name. Can I help you with something? Phoebe, come on! Look, I'm talking right now. You mean her. Oh. You know, twin stuff is always a real big seller. What? I could talk them into giving you. . . . . .thirty dollars. No! No way! No! And stop using my name! And shame on you! And shame on all of you! You're disgusting! Especially you, with that! The slides are almost ready. Yeah. I know what this is missing: Alcohol. There's wine in the kitchen. Oh, great. What is my sister doing there, and why are the drapes shut? Okay. Rach, calm down, okay? She's really upset. We're just talking. She's making something happen with you to get back at me. That's the only reason she could be here, huh? It couldn't be that maybe I'm a good listener. . . . . .and I put on a great slide show? Ross, I am telling you, she is using you to get back at me. I think I can take care of myself. I'll talk to you later. Goodbye. That was your sister, actually. She thinks you're just using me. So? -Hey. -Hey. I just came from the company Ursula works for. Oh, no, not you too? I went to get Phoebe Buffay's checks. There were a lot of them. Nice! And I won't have to go back there anymore. . . . . .because I gave them my ""correct address. "" Isn't it gonna bother you that people think you're a porn star? Oh, no, I know how to handle it. -Good. -Yeah. Trying to figure out how you know me? I'll give you a hint. From porn! Yeah, your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie! -See? -Yeah. Hey. You may have been right about Jill. I knew it! What happened? She kissed me. What? You kissed? Maybe we should give them some privacy. . . . Look, I tried not to kiss her, okay? Doesn't sound like it. It's easy not to kiss someone. You just don't. Look at us right now, not kissing! Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me. . . . . .and I didn't stop it. I guess I just wasn't thinking. Yeah. Let me give you something to think about. Hold on! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing. Thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister's mouth to tell me that. I realized if anything happened with me and Jill. . . . . .then nothing could ever happen with us. -What? -No, I mean. . . . I don't know if anything is ever going to happen with us. . . . . .again, ever. But I don't want to know that it never could. So I stopped it. . . . . .and she got mad and broke my projector. Wow. I don't even know what to say. Thank you. You're welcome. My God, are you crying? I just don't see why those two can't work things out! All right, I'm leaving. I'm not spending one more day with someone who's out to sabotage me. That's you, Rachel. Yeah, I got that. And you! I throw myself at you. . . . . .and you say no? How gay are you? You take care, Jill. -Okay, see you. -Bye-bye. I can't believe Jill's gone. I can't help it, I opened a gate! <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"

Who's Barry and Mindy? Barry was the guy I almost married, and Mindy was my best friend. Wasn't he cheating on you with her? That means he was falling asleep on her instead of me. Can you imagine if I'd married him? How different would my life be? I've always wondered how different life would be. . . . . .if I'd never gotten divorced. -Which time? -The first time! Imagine if Carol hadn't realized she was a lesbian. I can't. I keep seeing it the good way. I bet I'd still be doing my karate. Towards the end of our marriage, I did karate to release the tension. . . . . .from not doing anything else physical. Maybe the problem was pronouncing it ka-ra-tay. What if I was still fat? You wouldn't be dating me, that's for sure. -Sure I would. -Come on. You think I'm that shallow? I think Monica was that fat. Hey, imagine if I'd never gotten fired off Days of Our Lives. Hey. Hey, there's Carol again. What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I'd probably be writing for the New Yorker, being paid to be funny. But my job's fun too. I mean, tomorrow. . . . . .I don't have to wear a tie. What if I'd taken that job at Merrill Lynch? -What? -Merrill Lynch? A massage client who worked there said I had a knack for stocks. Why didn't you take it? At that time, I thought everything that rhymed was true. I thought if I worked with stocks. . . . . .I'd have to live in a box and only eat lox and have a pet fox. Do you think if all those things happened, we'd still hang out? The One That Could Have Been Part 1 English Subtitles by Gelula/SDI Oh, my God. Rachel Green? Rob Tilman! No, no, it's me. Ross.

Was his question, ""What's more boring than him?"" Hey, man. Sorry about that Archie thing. You need some money? Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride. Really? Joey doesn't have to give you money. -TV stars have assistants, right? -That's an idea. If I hire an assistant, would you take money from her? No, Joey. Chandler could be your assistant. He could answer your fan mail and stuff. That would be great! Let's do that! I could use the money. -Welcome aboard! -Okay! I need to use the bathroom. Since I don't need assistance in there, take a break! All right. -Hey. -Hey, Phoebe. Joey just hired Chandler. That's so sweet. Oh! Hang on! Hang on! Go! No. No, no. I said sell when it hits 50! Five-oh! It's a number! It comes after four-nine! No, it's okay. It's okay. You're allowed one mistake. Just kidding. You are fired. Hey, Mon? Mon, look who I ran into!

I've been not working for three hours, and I'm already going crazy. I miss Joan. Honey, a heart attack is nature's way of telling you to slow down. I always thought it was nature's way of telling you to die. You're not gonna die. I mean, you are going to die, but you're not gonna die today. I wish I was dead. Let's take a walk. You should consider writing for Talking Out of Your Ass magazine. What's going on with you? Well, I've been doing a lot more of my karate. -Still a dry spell with Carol? -Yeah. How long has it been since you've had sex? -Well, last weekend. . . -That's not so bad. . . .will be two months. . . . . .since I stopped trying. You need to spice things up. -What do you mean? -I don't know. You could tie her up. You could eat stuff off each other. Dirty talk, mnage  trois, toys. Role-playing. You're warden, she's prisoner. -You're the pirate, she's the wench. -Okay, I think I got it. You could be two stockbrokers, rolling naked on the trading floor. . . . . .and everybody's watching.

And that is an old man. -Hey, old man! -Hey. Alrighty. What do you say we head back to my place? You know, I would really love to, but I shouldn't. Why? Why can't the world stop turning? Just for a moment. Just for us. Isn't that from the show? Yeah, but. . . . . .I may have said those things before, but. . . . . .I never truly meant them until now. That's from the show too! Okay, you watch too much TV. Here's the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for. Thanks. There's pulp in that. I thought we talked about this. I don't like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isn't juice. All juice. I'm sorry. I guess I just like the pulp. I'm sorry. I am being so rude. Rachel, would you like a soda or something? Because Chandler will run right out and get it. Yeah, well, sure, iced tea would be great. Iced tea. Okay. Anything for you, sir? Did I not just tell him? Okay, look, Chandler, if this is gonna work. . . . . .you have got to listen. You're gonna throw that juice at me? It's not all juice. Honey, this morning was fun. Me hopping in on you in the shower there? Yeah, maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms. Look, Carol, I was thinking maybe. . . . . .maybe we can spice things up a little. -What do you mean? -Carol, our sex life. It's just not-- -Dad! -Hey there, little fella! Why don't we get some shoes on you? Show dad how you put your shoes on in your room. Seriously, our sex life. I was thinking maybe, I don't know. . . . . .we could try some new things, you know, for fun. -Like what? -Well, I don't know. What if we were to. . . . . .tie each other up? Some people eat stuff off one another. Yeah. You know, we could try dirty talk. -We could have a threesome. -I love that idea! Who sold a story to ""Archie Comics""? Oh, my God, that's so great. You're a published writer. I wish I had a present. Wait a minute. My last Kit Kat bar. -You want to share it? -Okay! Chandler, I know you're mad. I'm sorry. I was a total jerk. Completely over the line. I just. . . . I hate pulp. You know how Monica feels about low-fat mayonnaise? It's not mayonnaise! Anyway, I just wanted to say I'm sorry, and here. -What's this? -Fresh orange juice, with pulp. -Just the way you like. -Thanks, man. Hey, Joey? Chandler sold a story to ""Archie Comics. "" That's great! Congratulations! What's the story? You wouldn't care. It's just a stupid comic book story. Are you kidding me? I love Archie and the whole gang. Well, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy. But he doesn't want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist-- --as his butler. And makes him do crazy things. . . . . .Iike bring him milk shakes that can't have lumps. Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar. Did they already do that? I think I read it! Monica, listen. I have to ask. Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment. -Does he do this with a lot of girls? -Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot. And I'm one of them. I just cannot believe this. I mean, Joey Tribbiani. It's none of my business, but aren't you married? Yeah. I wish we could just not be married for a little bit. You know, I just wish we could be, like, on a break. Well, you're not. It's easy for you. You can have sex with whoever you want. Yeah, I can. Don't think I don't. I do. I mean, all the time. You bet! Monica? You've done it, right? Of course I have. What do you think, I'm like some 30-year-old virgin? Oh, my God. You're a 30-year-old virgin. Louder. I don't think the guy in the back heard. Yeah, I heard it. It's not like I haven't had the opportunity. I'm just waiting for the perfect guy. I'm seeing this guy. He's not perfect. . . . . .but I'm thinking maybe I should get it over with. You know, give him my flower. Oh, my God, do it! Honey, you've waited long enough. -You know what? You are right. -Sex doesn't have to be a big deal. There shouldn't be all these rules and restrictions. People should be able to sleep with whoever, whenever-- Rachel. I'll never think it's okay to cheat on your husband. What do you know, virgin? Phoebe? Why is smoke coming out of the bathroom? The doctor said that could be one of the side effects. Put the cigarette out. No, it's not a cigarette. The smoke is coming out of me! -Put it out. -Okay, okay! -I'm so glad you're here. -Come on. Give it to me! -I got it. -Give it! Hello? She can't come to the phone now. Right. No problem. Okay, bye-bye. Was it work? Was it Jack? Did he yell? No, just relax. Nobody yelled. Jack was making sure you were getting better. Thank God. Yeah, she's fired. You've done all you can, Dr. Wesley.

Even if you were horrible, how would I know? I do like that. It's harder for me. I have four women to compete with. Well, if it helps, there were only three. So it'd just be for tonight? Absolutely. It would just be one friend helping out another friend. Stop it. We're not doing this. -Let's do it! -No! Okay! Do you have any moves? I have some moves. I have no moves. Whatcha doing there? -I'm sorry, this is just too weird. -Yeah, forget it. What if I turn out the lights? That's the couch. Oh, my God! I know! I'll tell you something. We are gonna do that again! Morning. Oh, right. Oh, God. Oh, I can't believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up. He actually saw you a little bit too. Oh, God, we didn't. . .? Not after seeing that. God, I'm just a horrible person. Well, why? Because I'm married. That's right, I'm a married woman. I came to a TV star's apartment to have an affair. That's ridiculous. I'm not a ""star. "" I'm just a regular famous actor. And I'm a horrible, horrible person. Rachel, will you stop saying that? Hey, look. Remember on the show when Capri was dying? -And she gave me-- -The ring from the cave. Oh, my God! They let you keep that stuff? Sure. As long as they don't find out, you can keep whatever you want. And I want you to have it. No, I couldn't. Every time you look at it. . . . . .I want you to remember that you are a good person. Now, you had the chance to cheat. . . . . .and with me. But you didn't. And that's what this ring stands for. But I thought that ring stood for Capri's undying love for her brother. Look, you want the ring or not? Hey, look at you! You're up! I thought I'd try to take a walk. Will you pour me some water? I'll be back soon. You're not gonna call work, are you? No. I've learned my lesson. Let's go! Come on! Move it! Phoebe, come on! Shoes, briefcase. Thanks, Lou. Good luck with the gallbladder. Hey, Joe. . . . . .did you ever have a threesome? Look, Ross. Carol's great, and I'm sure you're a very attractive man, but. . . . No. The reason I'm asking is that. . . . . .I sort of had one last night. You? All right. So? Was it amazing? It was. . . . . .okay. Just okay? Did you do it right? Look, it's just, did you ever go to a party and think: ""Would anyone really miss me if I weren't here?"" But still, Ross. Your worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day. It's just. . . . . .my part seemed to be over pretty quickly. . . . . .and then there was a lot of waiting around. But you got to be with both of them. Not really. Just Carol. -Not the other one? -No, she kept kicking me away. You don't want that. At least you got to see a lot of stuff. Oh, I saw a lot of stuff. -You get a little bored? -A little. Made a snack. -What'd you have? -Just a sandwich. Turkey. A little mustard. -Sounds good. -It really was. Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night. Wait a minute, that was you. Hey, check me out. I'm a slut! So you want to do something tonight? I can't. Dr. Roger's coming over. Oh, right. Because you're still seeing him, and he's a good guy. I remember a time. . . . Are you okay? Yeah, totally. Totally. Are you? Great. It's so amazing. Last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous. But after being with you, I'm like, ""Can the doctor see me now?"" I bet he can. ""I don't have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical. "" -You sure you're okay? -Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. My God! Barry! You said you'd be away all weekend! That's right! I'm sorry! I am early! Finish, please! Surprise! Look who's back! Call security. Pheebs, didn't you get fired? I don't think so. -What are you doing here? -All better. Back to work. This clown from research told me I was fired. He should do his research, huh? Well, you were fired. I told that guy who answered your phone. I didn't get that message. So this doesn't count. Anyway, I'll be in my office. Phoebe, you don't have an office. I'll work right here. This is good. Next to this plant. You're in my office. I've made a lot of cash for this company. I am talking big bucks! Pesos! Yen! Rubles! You make one little mistake-- You lost 1 3 million dollars. So now this is all about money? You know, it's bad enough that. . . . You have got to be kidding. -Are you all right? -I'm having another heart attack. I'm having another heart attack! Call 91 1 ! Dumb-ass! Pheebs, how's it going? They fired me, and I'm having a heart attack. Well, welcome back. Is Joey Tribbiani here? If you see him, please tell him I'm looking for him. . . . . .and that this time I am not gonna throw up! Are you okay? Me? I'm great! I'm fine! I'm so good! But you know who's not great? Men! You're a man, right, Ross? Sit down. Let me ask you something. Do wedding vows mean squat to you people? Why is it that the second we go out of town. . . . . .bam, there you are in bed with the neighbor's dog-walker? We're sorry. No, seriously. Seriously. What has happened to the sanctity of marriage? -Didn't you spend last night at Joey's? -What are you, a detective? I don't know what's going on with you and your husband. . . . . .and what is hopefully an adult dog-walker. Look, can I just say, not all men are like that. There are men who'll do anything to make their marriage work. Men who will stand by and watch. . . . . .as their wives engage in what can only be described as a ""twosome"" . . . . . .with some woman she barely knows from the gym! Who are these men? Just men. A guy I know. Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife. . . . . .is gay. She is not. . . . She's gay. Oh, my God. She is so gay! I can't believe this. Good day for married people, huh? I'm sorry your husband cheated on you. I'm sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren't that great either. Try telling my wife that. Okay to come in? Come in, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again. Yeah, I know. Guess who beeped him? I'm the ruptured spleen. Why would you do that? Because you shouldn't be with him. You should be with me. Really? When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me. Things like last night don't just happen. At least not to me. I mean, with the other two women. . . . . .in the morning, I couldn't wait to go be with my friends. But with you. . . . . .I was, you know, already with a friend. You probably don't want to go out with me. I make too many jokes, I've never been in a serious relationship. . . . . .and I'm not technically a ""doctor. "" There was just one woman, wasn't there? No, there were two. Including me? It only takes two heart attacks To finally make you see One of them won 't do it But the second will set you free Tell all your hate and anger It's time to say goodbye And that is just what I will do Soon as those bastards I worked for Die! <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"
617,"Remember when I had a monkey? What was I thinking? Hey, so, what's with the 20 percent tip? Did I do something wrong? 20 percent is a pretty generous tip. You know what's more generous? 50 percent! -You know what's even more generous? -I see where you're going. What's up with the greed? I'm sorry. I have to get new headshots made, and they're really expensive. I'm down to, like, three. Actually, two, because one of them I blackened some teeth. Why'd I do that? Isn't there something you can do to earn extra money? Can't you pick up an extra shift here? Or, you know, I used to beg for money. It helps if you've got a little of this going on. Wow! I still have it. Don't you have an audition today? Maybe you'll get that job. Wait a minute. I used to get medical experiments done on me. Finally, an explanation. I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff. Let's see. . . . Well, I don't want to donate sperm again. I really prefer doing that at the home office. Maybe they want some of my blood or spit or something, huh? -Joey? -Yeah. What did I tell you about talking while working? Do it? That guy's been waiting 1 0 minutes. He's complained about you three times. Now, where was l? The One With Unagi English Subtitles by Gelula/SDI What are you up to? We went to a self-defense class today. Kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of you. Takes it out of you? Now we can kick anybody's ass. After one class? I don't think so. You want to see me self-defend myself? Pretend you're a predator. Go on, I dare you! Of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming. That's not enough. Look, I studied karate for a long time. And there's a concept you should be familiar with. It's what the Japanese call unagi. Isn't that a kind of sushi? No, it's a concept. Yeah, it is. It's freshwater eel. Maybe it means that too. I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now. Fine, get attacked. I don't even care. Come on, Ross, we're sorry. Please tell us what it is. Unagi is a state of total awareness. Only by achieving true unagi... . . .can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you. In case someone's trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat. . . . . .or your kettle of fish? It's one thing being prepared for an attack against each other. Whole other story being prepared for an, I don't know-- A surprise! You knew that was coming. . . . . .but that doesn't mean you have unagi. If we made reservations, we could have unagi in a half-hour. -Is Monica here? -No. I need help. I don't know what to get for Valentine's Day. Valentine's Day was two weeks ago, so I wouldn't get her a calendar. She was working, so we're celebrating tonight. Why don't you book a day for both of you at those romantic spas? That's actually a good idea. And, of course, crotchless panties. Appealing as that sounds to her boyfriend. . . . . .and her brother. We promised to make each other gifts this year. -I love that. -You guys! You can't make crotchless panties? You take scissors and cut-- Okay, okay, okay. Making things sounds so much fun. I thought so, until I papier-mchd one of my eyes shut. I love papier-mch! What did you make? I made a flar-lar-lar. -What is that? -Nothing! So, what'll you do? Have you made anything I can take credit for? I have, I have! I started making little sock bunnies! Oh, for crying out loud! Wait a minute. That is my sock! Now it's your little bunny friend. Okay. . . . This actually is a flar-lar-lar. Can I ask about the Valentine's Day gifts? -Yeah. -Do we have to make the entire thing? Yes. Did you forget to make yours? Of course not. I just have to go to the place where I made it and pick it up. I can't wait. It'll be the best Valentine's Day ever! I can't believe it! Make the presents! -What? -Just so excited to make the presents! Hi, I'm Joey Tribbiani. With all due respect, I'd like to donate some fluids. We're at the end of a research cycle and not looking for applicants now. That's too bad. I've been saving up. You sure there's no studies I can participate in? -Here's a schedule of what's coming up. -Thanks. This one starts now. Only identical twins are eligible. It's a twin study. But it's $2000! Sorry. And this? ""Testing the Effects of Joey Tribbiani on Attractive Nurse Receptionists. "" Results are back on that one. They're not good. -That was good. -Yeah. Danger! Danger! What the hell was that? A lesson in the importance of unagi. You're a freak! Perhaps. Now I'm curious. At what point during those girlish screams would you have kicked my ass? All right, so we weren't prepared! I'm sorry I took drastic measures to make my point. I just want you to be safe. Danger! Ah-ha! Unagi! 2000 bucks is a lot of money. I wish I had a twin. Where could I find someone... ... who looks exactly like me? Chandler. I sensed it was you. What? Unagi. I'm always aware. Are you aware that unagi is an eel? -What's up? -What should I make for Monica? Why don't you make her one of your little jokes? I'm going crazy. Do you have anything homemade? You know what? She'd love this. It's a replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade. I could use that. I could say, ""Your love sends me to the moon. "" Except Apollo 8 didn't actually land on the moon. You can write, ""Your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely. "" I can't give this to her. -Why not? -It says ""Captain Ross"" on the side. And it says, ""I hate Monica"" on the bottom. Danger! Salmon skin roll. ""Yes, honey, I made it myself. "" I can't do it. I can't do it. A mixed tape! A mixed tape! Hi! Ready to exchange gifts? -Sure. You go first. -Okay, come here. Okay, it's not wrapped because I just finished it. But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs. What a great gift! Is ""The Way You Look Tonight"" on it? We'll have to listen and see. Oh, I love it! Thank you so much. You ready to open yours? It's a sock bunny. Remember how I call you bunny? Not really. I did one time. And I want to start doing it more. -That's what this is about. -I see. Phoebe makes sock bunnies. No, she doesn't. What she makes, they're sock rabbits. They're completely different. Okay, okay. I didn't make it! I forgot about tonight and that we're supposed to make the presents. It's okay. No, it's not okay. You're so incredible. You went through all this time and effort to make this tape. I'll make this up to you. I will. I am going to cook you anything you want in here. And I'm going to do anything you want in there. Well, I did put a lot of thought into the tape. You are way too young to have seen that. Your birthday's in a month and a half. What if I forget to get you a present for that too? You are totally and completely 1 00 percent forgiven. We've got to wash that. Remember that jacket you loved that was too expensive? You have done enough. I'll wake up early and get it. No-- Get it in black, not brown. Your cake is ready. It's like that old saying, ""Have sex, eat some cake. "" Hey, Mon. Hey, Chan. Just getting a soda. Who the hell are you? I'm Joey. ""How are you doing?"" No! No! No! No! No! How ""you"" doing? How ""you"" doing? Damn it, Carl! Go wait in the hall. I've got to apologize on behalf of Carl. Who the hell is Carl? Did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my twin for a medical research project. Sometimes the good ideas are right in front of you. It sounds crazy, but it might work. The only problem is Carl's acting. . . . The only problem? He's the reason I didn't get that big commercial two years ago. We were supposed to be brothers, but he messed up. Can I get a piece of that cake? Pizza! We like pizza! Get out! -Pat Sajak? -Yep. -Alex Trebek? -Of course. -Chuck Woolery? -Definitely. You will not find a single game show host whose ass I cannot kick. -Say it! -Say we are unagi! It's not something you are, it's something you have. Say it! I could easily get out of this. . . . . .but there's a chance you could get very, very hurt! Carl, we're next. Now remember, what is this not gonna be? -Another Minute Maid fiasco. -That's right. And what are you not gonna do? -I'm not gonna talk because-- -Damn it, Carl! Can I have the next one, please? Thank you. Joey and Tony Tribbiani. That's us. But this is a study for identical twins. That's right. $2000. But you're not identical twins. Damn it, Carl! Oh, my good God. Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, number three: Macaroni and cheese with cut-up hot dogs. Look, you have done enough. You have to stop this now. I will. But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape that you made me. Oh, the mixed tape. ""The Way You Look Tonight"" is on here. Dance with me. You are just the sweetest. I love the way you look every night, Chandler. That's why I made you this tape. Happy birthday! Love, Janice! No, you're the sweetest. Okay, ladies, that ends today's class. Remember, be safe out there. -Great class. -Thanks. I was watching. A couple of questions: You know that last move. . . . . .where that woman tripped you and pinned you to the floor? What would you do next? She'd take the keys and jam them in your-- No, no. What would you do next? -Who, me, the attacker? -Yes, that's right. Why? I tried attacking two women. Did not work. What? No, it's okay. They're my friends. In fact, I was married to one of them. You attacked your ex-wife? Oh, no. No, no. I tried. But I couldn't. That's why I'm here. Maybe we could attack them together! That's a no. I am so, so, so, so sorry. And I will cook anything you want in here. And do anything you want in there. Yeah, you will! And are you kidding me? Come on, Monica, it's our Valentine's Day. Please, please, please, please? Okay. My funny Valentine Sweet comic Valentine -So are we going in there? -I am! Your looks are laughable Nowhere to run. I don't like sitting here. I'm gonna go over-- No, they got here first. -Why is Ross doing that? -Danger! Oh, my God! Why is he jumping on those women? We should help them.

Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the Paleontology Department. "" ""Hotties of Paleontology. "" There's a big-selling calendar, eh? -Who wrote it? -The evaluations are all anonymous. -You still have their exams? -Yeah. You could just match the handwriting and, boom, there's your admirer. A hot girl's at stake, and he becomes Rain Man. Wait a minute. Why are we so sure that this is a girl? It's a girl! Anyway, it wouldn't matter, okay? Because I'm a teacher. She's a student. -It's against the rules? -It's frowned upon. -Besides, there's a big age difference. -When you're 90-- I know, she'll be 80 and it won't seem like such a big difference. No, that's not what I was gonna say at all. When you're 90, you'll still have the memory of being with a 20-year-old. The One Where Ross Dates A Student English Subtitles by Gelula/SDI Chandler, you know your college friend who became a movie director? Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my movement class. -What's a movement class? -He's pretending he didn't take mime. She's directing a new AI Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition. I haven't talked to her in, like, 1 0 years. Please, Chandler, I would owe you so much. You do owe me so much. You owe me 3000-- Hey, hey, dude. Why you changing the subject? What? -Will you make the call? -Okay, I'll try. Thanks. Last auditions are Thursday, so I gotta get in by Thursday. Just remember Thursday. Can you remember Thursday? Yeah, so Tuesday? Thursday! Just think of it like this: The third day. Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday. . . . When, huh, what day? Thursday! The third day, okay? -Thank you. -Okay. -I'm gonna check my messages. -You thought of that in there? Sure, nature called. She wants to see who else did. Hello? Rachel. Someone is in our apartment. Call the cops! You're on the phone! -Oh, my God! -What? Oh, my God! Thank you! Fire department put out a fire at our place! -Oh, my God! How bad was it? -It was a fire, I'm guessing not good. -Come on, we gotta go! -Yeah, come on. What are you smiling about? The part I want to audition for is a fireman. This is so meant to be! You were very generous with your grades this semester. -Professor Geller? -Yeah? -I really enjoyed your class. -Oh, thank you. Thanks very much. I'm a little embarrassed about calling you a ""hottie. "" -That was you? -Yeah. I felt a little weird about it. You're a teacher. I'm a student. Want to go out sometime? That's not the best idea. Oh, because I was thinking, the semester's over. -You're not my teacher anymore. -What time? Oh, you know what? Forget it. I see you already gave me an A. -Gotcha. -I'm kidding! God! So seriously, what time? Coming through. Coming through. Oh! Hello. Hi. Right. Coming through! Okay. Well, it's not so bad. Most of the damage was contained in the bedrooms. Hey, buddy, think I could borrow your uniform this Thursday? -Excuse me? -Joey! He's working. You would look good in that. Oh, how bad is it? It's bad, it's really bad. The only thing that isn't burned is an ax, which I do not remember buying. -How's your room? -Everything's ruined. My bed, my clothes. Look at my favorite sweater. Isn't that mine? Fine. I'm sorry for your loss. You won't be able to live here for a while. You have a place to stay? Oh! Wow! Okay, look, pal. . . . . .I am not in the mood to be hit on right now. But if you give me your number, I'll call you sometime. Yes, they can stay with us. Do you know what started the fire, Mr. Fireman? Well, do either of you smoke? No, not usually. But yeah, I could use one now. Thanks. -Do you light candles, burn incense? -Yes, I do all the time. I love them! Oh, my God, I did it! It's me, it's me! I burned down the house! Okay, Phoebe, calm down. There's no need to place blame. Okay? I warned her about those candles. It's great to catch up. I can't believe how long it's been. Hey, Chandler, is that. . .? -Oh, that's great, good for you. -So, is it. . .? Okay. So, yeah, maybe we can get together. . . . Can you hold on for one second? What? Do you want to get a pizza later? Hi, I'm back. Yeah, that sounds great. We'll do it then. Okay, bye. When's my audition? I know it's Thursday, but what time? Hi. We didn't get to the audition. I'm taking her to coffee. We'll do it then. Now you're going on a date with this girl? I haven't talked to her in 1 0 years. You can't just call up and ask somebody for a favor. There are rules, you know? You gotta put in some time. Right, I'm sorry. -It's not like she's an ex-girlfriend. -We only went out once. You dated her?! Not once. Why don't I just go out with an ex, you know, and do Joey a favor? You want to do Joey a favor? Maybe you go out with Joey. That's great. My friend Joey's in the movie business. You know who I ran into from school? Howie. My friend's name is Joey. Apparently, Howie's editing now. Yeah, he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie. Can you believe that? You know, I haven't spoken to him in 1 0 years. . . . . .and he asks me for a favor? Yeah, I've always hated that Howie. No ""How you doing?"" Man, I mean, not even a cup of coffee first. -The nerve, huh? -Yeah. Refill? This is last-minute, so I want to apologize for the mess. Oh, who cares? Oh, my God! It sure didn't look this way when I lived here. I know! But there's only room for one, so one of you will have to stay at Joey's. Since the fire was kind of my fault, you should get to stay here. Hey, hey, now. This was no one's fault. It was an accident. It was my fault. You should get the nice room. Okay! You're the first guest at ""Hotel Monica. "" Hotel Monica! Just tell me how you like your eggs. I thought I'd bring them to you in bed. -You've been through so much. -I have. This right here is where I keep the pizza. And that's where the napkin is. -What's that smell? -I know! I don't. . .? Oh, please, it was such a big class. You never even noticed me. What? Of course I did. You sat next to ""Sleepy Sleeperson. "" Who? Oh. I had trouble remembering names, so I came up with nicknames. The guy on the other side of you was ""Smelly Von Brown Shirt.

You said it might be weird, the whole student/teacher thing? And to be frank, I thought it would be too. But it's not. I mean, it's not at all. -Dr. Geller! -Burt! Did you sleep well last night? -I did. -Yeah? Monica was so sweet. She left a little mint on my pillow. Know what Joey left on my pillow? Gum. -We determined the cause of the fire. -I know. It was my candle, my candle! No, there was an appliance left on. It looks like a curling iron. -I don't use a curling iron. -Someone does. Don't look at me, my hair's straight. Straight, straight, straight. -It could've been a hair-straightener. -Oh. This is where I keep the pizza. And-- Hey, where'd the napkin go? I wouldn't want my best guest to strain her eyes. Thanks, Monica. -Does that smell bother you? -From Joey's? I can hardly smell it over here. Well, you let me know if you can. I can bake a pie to cover it. -I can smell it a little, bake the pie. -Okay. Hello? One minute, please. It's the fire inspector. Hello? Yeah, this is Phoebe. Really? Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn't the hair-straightener. . . . . .that started the fire. No, no. It was the candles. Yeah. It's very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is. . . . . .okay, well I have to go now. We had such a great time. She's incredible. I thought the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn't. Elizabeth is very mature for her age. A concept lost on some people. It's okay to date a student? Well, not really. Technically, it's not against the rules. But it's frowned upon, especially by the professor we saw last night: ""Judgy Von Holier-than-thou. "" You don't want to get a reputation as ""Professor McNails-his-students. "" -Yeah. What should I do? -Well, it seems pretty clear. What's more important? What people think or how you feel? -You gotta follow your heart. -Joey, that's so sweet. -Hi. -Hey! So how'd it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open? Say, Thursday? -I couldn't do it. -You couldn't do it? I need more time. We're going to dinner. You're going out with her again? -Going out with who? -Dana Keystone, from college. Oh, yeah. Wasn't she. . .? No, that was Dana Kaplan. Oh. -Joey, you didn't even know her! -Yeah, whatever. Great story again. The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo! You know, actually I should get going. Oh, no, no, stay! Because you should stay. Wow. Oh, I am really flattered. But I just. . . . I don't feel that way about you. Oh, no, no. That's not-- I'm sorry, Chandler. You know, you're such a sweet guy. . . . . .and I don't want to hurt you. I wish I could do something to make you feel better. No-- Really? Of course. Well, it just hurts so bad, l. . . . Oh, I'm sorry. -Maybe there is one thing you can do. -What? Anything. Anything. Well, I mean, this is just off the top of my head now. But I have this friend-- This actor friend. He would kill me if he knew that I was doing this. But. . . . . .would it be possible for him to audition for your movie on Thursday? Absolutely. But. . . . . .you'd really feel better if your friend could audition for my movie? The heart wants what it wants. Bye. Hey! How's it going? Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes. Yes, it has. I made cookies! I'm still full from your homemade potato chips. But you should eat them now, because they're hot from the oven. Okay. But not in here! Can't eat them in bed, remember? No crummies! Oh. Okay, I'll be out in a second. Okay. -What are you doing? -This doesn't lock, does it? -Oh! Joey, I'm sorry. -It's all right, don't worry about it. But look! That's gonna leave a stain. Rach, hey, it's fine. You're at Joey's. -Really? -Yeah, look. Yeah. -I've never lived like this before. -I know. Well, don't waste it. I mean, it's still food. What do you want to do now? Want to get a drink? I can't. -Oh, you have some studying to do? -No, I have some turning 21 to do. You know, I remember when I was in college, we used to-- -What are you doing? -Nothing, I'm so comfortable with you. Do you not want to be seen with me? No, of course I do. Are they gone? No, they're still here. But I think I'm about to leave. What? No, no, wait, wait-- You're right, this is stupid. Who cares what people think? I mean, we like each other, right? There's nothing wrong with that. Come on. Burt. Lydia. Mel. -This is Elizabeth. -Hi. Aren't you in my popular culture class? That's right, Lydia. Elizabeth is a student. And we're dating. And you may frown upon that but. . . . . .we're not gonna hide it anymore. You are so fired. -What? -They'll fire you. You can't date her. It's against the rules. Really? It's not just frowned upon? I love it at Joey's! -Nice! -Thanks. So, you busy Thursday? Oh, very funny. Remember? My audition was supposed to be Thursday. You got me the audition? Let's hug it up! Okay, okay! What are you gonna do to me if you get the part? -Hey. -Hi. Yeah, okay, I need to talk to you. I know they said the hair-straightener started the fire. But I think I'm partly at fault. You see, I didn't tell you, but. . . . . .I had recently refilled the tissues. And so, let's face it, that's just kindling. So I think it's fair that I stay at Joey's. No, no, no, this was my fault. -Besides, I'm fine here. -Okay. -Chandler, Monica's looking for you. -Really? -She said something about crummies. -No, no, no! I was so careful. You have to switch with me. Monica is driving me crazy. That's right. All the ladies want to stay at Joey's. No, I don't want to switch. Please! I can throw wet paper towels here! No, but at Monica's, you can eat cookies over the sink. I know. I'm sorry. All right, fine. This looks like so much fun. God, what a mess. Wow, it actually is in the handbook. I can't date you or have a hot plate in my office. I can't believe we have to stop seeing each other. For what it's worth, I did appreciate you standing up for me. That felt really nice. Kind of made me like you even more. I know, I know. I really like you too. But we can't date. It's against the rules. It's forbidden. Wow. What? Just hearing you describe it as ""forbidden"" . . . . . .it's really hot. Really? Yeah. Well, I don't care how hot it is, it's wrong. -Stop it. -No, no. It's wrong. It's naughty. It's. . . . . .taboo. Shut the book. Hey. Let's also get a hot plate. Hey. Hey. So? So. . .? It's Thursday! How was the audition? It's-- Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, what day-- Oh! <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"
619,"Well, that thing's clearly in the way. All right. Damn fridge! -Hi, Joey. How ya doin'? -Great... ...roomie. -Yeah, I guess we are roommates now. -I know. Now that you bring it up, our fridge is broken. We have to get a new one. I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot. I'm not paying for half of that. I'm only staying here until my apartment gets fixed. Look, Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born. Okay? Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell ya? That refrigerators don't live as long as people? All right, you know that the ATM only lets you take out $300 at a time, so... ...l'll take a check for the other $100. You're jokin', right? Of course I'm joking. I don't take checks. Thank God, you're pretty. The One with Joey's Fridge English subtitles by Softitler Hi! Do you guys know any cute guys? Well, of course, I do. My good friend, Joey, over here. I'm sorry. Thank you, Chandler. There's a big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table... ...so I kind of have to go. -What's the charity? -I don't know. Something, either trees or disease.... Ralph mumbles a lot. -He mumbles when you're not attentive? -Yeah. It's weird. But the thing is, I need to find a date. What type are you looking for? Someone that has his own tux or the ability to rent a tux. So he has to be a male who has at least $50. So close. -Hi, everybody! -Hi, there. -This is Elizabeth. -Hi, Elizabeth. I'm a student. Isn't she cute? Nope. This is none of my business, but weren't you guys supposed to... ...not be seen in public together? We're not together. No. We're just two people who happen to have run into each other here. This is.... Oh, sly! I really wanted to meet you guys, but I have to run. -I'll see ya later? -Okay. -Bye, Ross. -Bye. See you. -Didn't mean to run into you like that, sir. -That is quite all right, ma'am. Bye. So, why's she leaving? ls it a school night and she has a lot of homework? Yes. Her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow. Well, tell her ""good luck"" with that. Anyone else? Bring 'em on. -When's her birthday? -I don't know, Rachel. Why? Well, you know it's just been so long since I've been to Chuck E. Cheese. -I like Elizabeth. -Well, thanks. In fact, I like her so much that you tell her I want my cookies early this year. A box of Thin Mints and some Tagalongs. Guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how's it going with her? Well, it's actually been great. She's 20, so she's not looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me now. Well, that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice. I know you guys like giving me a hard time... ...but it means a lot to me that you like her. -Just knowing you guys are, like-- -Okay, I got a good one. What is she, like 12? Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough? Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll Ups? Okay. I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take. That's so funny 'cause we found someone, too. That's good. I guess she'll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo. -Why would our guy be a weirdo? -'Cause that's just your taste. See, Rachel's not gonna pick your stupid guy. -Yeah? -Yeah. My guy is a lawyer who does volunteer work. And, he has one of these. A face ass? A chin dimple. Well, our guy works with Chandler. And he's really nice and smart and he's a great dresser. -Have you seen your guy's body? -No. Our guy's just a floating head. Well, my guy is spectacular, okay? He's a massage client. And one time, when he was on the table, I looked at it. And I mean, all of it. -You're not supposed to look. -Yeah, like there are police for that. What, you look? You massaged me. I know. All right, your guy may have a great body, but our guy... ...is really funny. Chandler funny? -Our guy's a great dancer. -My guy's well-read. -Our guy has great hair. -My guy has great teeth. Our guys smells incredible. Do you want our guy to be your guy? Well, you don't look good, Joe. Well, the fridge broke, so I had to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes. What was in that brown jar? -That's still in there? -Not anymore. So, anyway, how do you want to pay me? Is this a service you're providing me? No, for my new fridge. For our new fridge. ""Our"" new fridge? -I don't live here anymore. -So what? Look, okay, suppose we were a divorced couple. And I got custody of the kid. Right? Now suppose the kid dies and I gotta buy a new kid. Okay. Gimme $400! Professor Geller? Oh, a student I don't know. I was wondering if I could talk to you for a moment? Yes, of course. What would this be regarding? Making out in your office. Of course. Why don't we go inside. -What? -Doorknob. Sorry. I actually do need to talk to you. Okay, what about? -Spring vacation? -Spring vacation? Yeah, we have time off and a lot of people are going on trips-- -Professor Geller. -Yes, Professor Fiesenstinlender? I'll be with you in one moment. So, I will take one box of the Thin Mints. You don't understand. Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her. Is that taking it slow? I'm not ready for this, okay? -What do I tell her? -Tell her the truth. You're not ready. I could do that. -Well, what if she gets upset? -Then you distract her with a Barbie doll. Or, you could just, you know, you.... What the hell are you doing? What the hell am I doin'? You just broke my fridge! What? How do you know it.... How do you know it's even broken? You think I don't know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me! Well, what do you know? Broken! That'll be $400. Joey, I saw you push him. You pushed him? Joey, I did not break this. Okay? That has been broken for a while. Chandler, remember I told you about our fridge? I still haven't gotten the check for your half yet. Do not give him any money! I'm not talkin' to you! You broke my fridge! -You wanted to see me, Professor Geller? -Yes. Please come in. -Doorknob? -Yeah. It kind of grows on you. Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about spring vacation. Good. Look, l.... I've been having a great time with you. And I just don't want us to move too fast or put too much pressure on us. So, I'm sorry, I just don't think we should go away together yet. It's too soon. Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to tell you that I'm going to Florida for a couple weeks. No. I think you misunderstood what I was saying. What I meant was-- You are so adorable. That. Let's talk about that. -Hi. -Hi. How did it go with Elizabeth? Fine. It was just a misunderstanding. She didn't want me to go with her. She just wanted to tell me that she's going to Florida for spring vacation. Wait, is she going for spring vacation or spring break, wahoo? What's the difference? A spring vacation, you're doing nice things with your grandparents. Spring break, you're doing frat guys. You know what? Not all spring breaks are like that. -What did you do on yours? -I went to Egypt with my dad. I can see it now. ""Look, Dad, it's the Sphinx, wahoo! "" I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than: ""Spring break, wahoo! "" All right? Come on, she's taking my class. -And slept with the professor. -I'm gonna call her. You guys, I want you to meet Sebastian. We just met at the newsstand. We both grabbed for the last Field and Stream. What? I read that. -Can I get you a cup of coffee? -Yes. Thank you. -Rachel, what the hell is this? -What? You ask us to find you a guy and then you come in here with a guy of your own. You found me a guy? Yes, we found you a really cute and funny guy from Chandler's work. Yeah, and I found you one, too, who is not a weirdo. You know what though, guys, I really appreciate that... ...but I'm just gonna take Sebastian to the charity. Are you sure? Because our guy smells incredible. Would you stop it with that already? -Here you go. -Thank you. So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work? -No, not really. Why? -No reason. It's just I know a single guy who does care about other people. Are you funny? -Excuse me? -What are you guys doing? Are you funny? Tell us a joke! Look, I just wanted to have coffee with Rachel. Well, so do a lot of people. -Actually, I gotta get going. -But you-- -Give me a call sometime. -But you didn't give me your number. Okay, see you later. Turns out he is kinda funny. I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he just left because of you! Yeah, but, ""Sebastian""? What is that, a cat's name? You know what I noticed, Rachel, he scares easy. Now, is that the kind of guy you want to take to a ball? ""Sebastian, would you like to dance?"" ""Okay. I gotta go."" All right, guys stop it. Rachel, we're very sorry. That is a very insensitive thing for us to do. You know what? Let's make it up to you. We've two great guys for you. Yeah, what have you got to lose? You might even end up with someone really special. If you pick my guy. -All right. -Okay. So, you will meet our guys? Yes, I'll meet 'em. It doesn't matter which one you choose. It's up to you. Our guy is perfect. Or you could go out with the guy Phoebe deemed was unsuitable for herself. Phoebe, there you are! Okay, you broke my fridge. You owe me $400. -Okay, sure. -Really? Technically, you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts... ...on your last 10 auditions. Call it even? Okay. There you are. So, what did Elizabeth say? Turns out she is going to Daytona for ""spring break, wahoo! "" That means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girls' bodies... ...waking up next to people you don't even know. She is gonna have a great time! Is she staying at the Hotel Corona? -You know the hotels? -I was there! Spring Break '81, wahoo! In 1981, you were 13. So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts. I had a blast. You know who knows how to party? Drunk college chicks. Okay, she can't go. You can't tell her not to go. You just started dating. -Then what am I supposed to do? -Nothing. Just be cool with it. What if she goes down there and then sleeps with a bunch of guys? Well, maybe you don't marry this one. I'm so glad you're going on this trip. Yeah, I've been working so hard this semester. I really need to go crazy, blow off some steam. Sure. Look, I don't know if your plans are finalized yet, but... ...l know another great way to blow off steam. -What? -Are you into crafts at all? Ross, are you okay? Yeah. Of course I'm okay. I'm just being supportive. Supportive of you and this whole trip... ...and what's this? It's a bathing suit? To wear in front of people? Is that supportive? Is this? Okay, good. -Hi. -Hi. We're so glad you decided to meet our guy. You're gonna like him so much. -When do you want to meet him? -I don't know. -I don't work late tomorrow night. -Tomorrow night is good. But why put off something 'til tomorrow when you can do it right now. -Eldad, come here! -What? -Eldad, this is Rachel. -How are you? A little blind-sided, but, you know, good. Eldad, sit down. Move over now. There you go. There you are. Okay, we can take a hint! What? What are you doing here? This is Patrick. -Hi. -Hi. You're too late, because she's already with our guy. Oh, my God, you're right, I am too late. They're sitting on the couch and talking. Come on. Rachel? This is Patrick. -Hi. -Hi. This is the guy I was telling you about. Believe me, this suit does not do justice to what's underneath it. Okay. But Pheebs, I'm just sort of in the middle of something. Okay. Have a seat. -You can't do that! -Maybe I should go. Just sit down, we're winning. Okay, you know what? Maybe I should go. No. Have a seat! Rachel, you haven't touched Eldad's hair. -It is the softest hair. Touch it. -I'm good. Rachel, Patrick is really rich. Give her some money. Phoebe, this isn't really worth the free massage. -That's right, Patrick. Bye-bye. -No. Eldad is much more cooperative and he can dance. You dance for Rachel. No, don't dance for me, please! What is the matter with you guys? Yeah, okay, let's talk it out. Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for? I'm a little embarrassed. I'll tell you who should be embarrassed. It's you guys. This is ridiculous! Thank you, but I do not need you to get me a date. -Then why did she ask us to help her-- -I am still talking! Then you chase away the one guy that I actually liked. No offense to you guys. Really, congratulations on... ...all the cash. And you really do have very soft hair. But I'd much rather go to the ball by myself than go through more of this. Goodbye. Now, do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair? Yes, papaya extract. Thank you. So, have a great time down there. -I will. -Yeah. -Did you pack that bathing suit? -Yeah. It was pretty funny when I hid it for a while. Anyway. I am worried about that bathing suit. Not because it's revealing, which I'm fine with. No, I'm concerned about your health. Sun exposure. Don't worry, I have plenty of sun block. -It's SPF 30. -All right. Well, if what's in the bottle is actually 30. I mean, sometimes you get 30, sometimes it's 4 and I swear... ...more often than not, it's just milk. Ross, it's gonna be okay. I'm not going down there to hook up with a bunch of guys. I really like you. I like how things are going between us. -Really? -Yeah. I'm just going down there to relax and hang out with my friends. Okay. Cool. Here they are! Call me! Rachel, we're sorry for pushing those guys on you. That's all right. I ended up having a really good time. The charity was a big success, they raised a lot of money and awareness. So, what was it for, anyway? I wanna say a disease. I just got this weird message from Ross. He said to turn on MTV. I don't know. Oh, my God, look! That's Elizabeth! Professor Geller. To be 13 again.... <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"

The One With Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. English subtitles by Softitler So, what's this thing you're auditioning for? It's a new TV show. Yeah. I'm up for the part of Mac, Machiavelli, or ""Mac""! I'm a detective and I solve crimes with the help of my robot partner. He's a computerized humanoid... ...electronically enhanced, secret enforcer. Or, ""C.H.E.E.S.E."" -So, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.? -That's the title! They really lucked out that the initials spell ""cheese."" That is lucky. So Joey, if you get this, you're gonna be, like... ...the star of your own TV show. I mean, you'll be like the ""Big Cheese"" or the ""Big Mac."" Hey, you love those! Don't get your hopes up, because it's probably not gonna happen. Now, why would you say that, Joseph? Well, I mean, come on you guys. My own TV show? -I don't know if I'm good enough. -I am. What are you talkin' about? You're a terrific actor. -You really think so? -How can you even ask that question? -She's pretty. -Yeah. And she's really nice, too. She taught me all about, you know, how to work with cameras... ...and ""smell the fart"" acting. -I'm sorry. What, Joey? -What? Excuse me? It's like you got so many lines to learn so fast... ...that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense. You know, like this. Okay. Here's my scene! Here's my scene! Mrs. Wallace? I'm Dr. Drake Ramorey, your sister's neurosurgeon. You sister is suffering from a.... Well, Eva, we've done some excellent work here. And I would have to say your problem is quite clear. ""All you want is a tinkle ""What you envy's a schwang ""A thing through which you can tinkle ""Or play with or simply let hang"" I play AI Pacino's butt. All right? He goes into the shower and then, I'm his butt. -Oh, my God. -Come on, you guys. This is a real movie and AI Pacino's in it, and that's big! No, it's terrific. You deserve this after all your years of struggling... ...you've finally been able to crack your way into show business. Okay, fine, make jokes. I don't care. This is a big break for me. -No, you're right, it is. -Yeah. So, you gonna invite us all to the big opening? All right, I'm out of here. Wish me luck. ""Good luck, good luck We all wish you good luck"" Yeah, whatever. It's your turn. Oh, are we playing this? Hi. How did the audition go? Terrible. I messed up every word. I shouldn't even be an actor. Wait. Are you doin' that thing where you pretend it didn't go well... ...but it really did go well? -Yeah, did I fool ya? -Totally! -So, it did go well? -It went amazingly well! -Great! -That's great. -It's down to me and two other guys. -Oh, my God! I know both of them, and they're really good. One's from those allergy commercials who's always being chased... -...by those big flowers. -Oh, I love that guy! What are you doing? What am I doing? I'm so nervous, you know? The callback isn't 'til tomorrow at 5:00. I feel like my head's gonna explode. Well, it is overdue. Don't worry, okay? You're gonna be fine. Yeah, but it's so much pressure. No offense, but what you guys all do is very different. I don't know if you'd understand. Yeah, none of the rest of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs. Yes, I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the wee-ness and I'm not happy. Well, I'm tearing the lettuce. -Is it dirty? -No, don't worry, I'm gonna wash it. Don't. I like it dirty. That's your call. So, what are you going to do next? Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatoes. Are they firm? They're all right. You sure they haven't gone bad? You sure they're not very, very bad? No, really. They're okay. You gonna slice 'em up real nice? Actually, I was gonna do them julienne. I'm out of here. Monica, I'm quitting. I just helped an 81-year-old woman put on a thong... ...and she didn't even buy it. I'm quitting. That's it. I'm talking to my boss right now. Yes, I am. Yes, I am. Okay, bye. Call me when you get this message. Well, what happened? Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until.... Oh, my God. And all of a sudden, his hands weren't the problem anymore. -Was it? -Boy Scouts could've camped under there. You ate my sandwich. It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone. Really? Now calm down. Come look in my office. Some of it may still be in the trash. -What? -Well, it was quite large. I had to throw most of it away. You threw my sandwich away? My sandwich? My sandwich! It's just, I want this part so much, you know? If I don't get this part, I'm never gonna eat macaroni and cheese again. No, I didn't say that. That doesn't count. Come on, guys. It's not like I moved to Europe. I just moved across the hall. And we would have you over all the time... ...if it weren't for Monica's allergies. You're right, I could never lie to you. She hates you. Should I get that? Hello? No, Joey's not here right now. Can I take a message? Yeah, okay. So the audition's been moved from 5:00 to 2:30? Okay, great. Bye. -Aren't you dressed yet? -Am I naked again? We're supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes. Okay. I was just talkin' to the guys. Just look at 'em. I mean, is it okay if they come visit? What about my allergies? Right. Your allergies. All her. She hates you. Yes! All right. How cool would it be if you could watch like a real life-size version of this? -I mean, how crazy would that be? -As crazy as soccer? Hello? What are you talkin' about? The audition's not 'til 5:00. Well, nobody told me. Who'd you talk to? Never mind. You mean you didn't get it from this? The allergy guy got the part. Thanks. Maybe we can fix it, you know? Maybe we can send him some big, big flowers and scare him! How could you do this to me? This part could've turned my whole career around. I messed up, okay? I'm sorry. I really messed up. You don't even live here anymore. Why'd you answer my phone? -I have a machine! -Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. If there was anything I could do, I would do it, okay? But everybody's allowed one mistake, right? He could have gotten me a VCR. He could have gotten me golf clubs. But no, he has to get me the ""Woman Repeller."" The eyesore from the ""Liberace House of Crap! "" -It's not that bad. -Easy for you to say. You don't have to sport a reject from the ""Mr. T"" collection. Chandler. Chandler. I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry! I do! I do! I pity the fool that.... When you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking and... ...one thing led to another and.... And what? Did you sleep with her? -No! No, I just kissed her. -What? That's even worse! -How is that worse? -I don't know! But it's the same! You're right, I have no excuses. I was totally over the line. ""Over the line?"" You're so far past the line that you can't even see the line! Yeah, the line is a dot to you! I'm not saying that you should magically forgive me. But you're not perfect. You've made some errors in judgment, too. Name one! What happened? Man! He promised he wouldn't take the chairs! What the hell happened? How were you locked in? And where the hell's all of our stuff? This guy came by to look at the unit... ...and he said he didn't think it was big enough to fit a grown man. So you got in voluntarily? I was tryin' to make a sale! Man, if I ever run into that guy again, you know what I'm gonna do? Bend over? There's Lori. Okay, now remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess. -Hi, Joey. -Hey. Well, well. Look what you brought. And what did you bring? She's checking her coat. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel and a glass of red for Janice. Janice? Oh, my God! Joey's tailor took advantage of me. What? No way. I've been goin' to the guy for 12 years. You said he was gonna do my inseam... ...then he ran his hand up my leg and then there was definite.... What? Cupping. That's how they do pants! Ross, will you tell him? -Isn't that how a tailor measures pants? -Yes, yes, it is. In prison! I said name one! -I can't believe I did this. What an idiot! -Stop beating yourself up. People make mistakes. These things happen. I hope there aren't any messages you've forgotten to give me, are there? Apparently, you're not very good at it. -Do you think he'll ever forgive me? -Of course he will. Chandler, the most important thing is that you forgive yourself. -You know what, I kind of have. -Already? That was pretty bad what you did. You know what? He will forgive you. I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone, just in case. Okay? You didn't see how mad he was, you know? I'm sure he will forgive you. Look, we've all been there, you know? You fight, you make up. That's the way it works. It took two people to break up this relationship! Yeah! You and that girl from the copy place... ...which yesterday you took full responsibility for! I didn't know what I was taking responsibility for, okay? I didn't finish the whole letter. -What? -I fell asleep. You fell asleep? It was 5:30 in the morning. And you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back! And by the way? Y-O-U, apostrophe R-E means, ""you are."" Y-O-U-R means ""your."" I can't believe I thought of getting back together with you. We are so over! Fine by me! And just so you know, it's not that common... ...it doesn't happen to every guy, and it is a big deal! I knew it! You had no right to go out with him. That is the most ridiculous-- -You sold me out! -I did not sell you out! -Yes, you did! You absolutely sold me-- -Would you let me talk? Did you just flick me? Okay, well you wouldn't let me finish and I was just-- Stop it! -Stop. -Stop. -All right. No, let's not do this. -No! -Happy thoughts. -No! -Happy thoughts. -No! Okay, now I'm gonna kick some ass! All right. Now, I will let go if you both stop. -Fine. -Fine. There we go. You know what? lf we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches. Okay, buddy boy, here it is. You hide my clothes?

Allergy... ...actor... ...attacked. By dog... ...not... ...flowers. Please tell me you got the message. -What message? -The actor playing Mac couldn't do it. -They needed to see you at 2:00. -What? It's 6:00! Look! I wrote it! I wrote it on the board! I wrote it down, then went lookin' all over for ya! I went to Ross's, the coffee house.... I went to any place that they make sandwiches! -I can't believe this, Chandler! -I'm sorry. I don't know what to say! You might say, ""Congratulations! "" I saw the board, I went to the audition, I got the part! Was that supposed to be funny? I was worried over here. -I'm sorry. -At times that fake-out thing is just mean. Okay, man. I'm sorry.

621,"-Okay, Chandler. -Okay. And your horoscope says: ""On the 5th, a special someone will give you a gift."" Well, thank you in advance. ""But the 12th brings a lover's spat."" You're going to make a joke about my special present. Why would you do that? Wait. ""On the 19th, a secret crush announces itself."" -Hey, guys. -Hey. Oh, my God! It's Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. That's right. It's your first day. Are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick? Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? I've dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing? Joey, you're gonna be great. But I gotta act with a robot. I don't know anything about technology. I can't even use Chandler's computer, except to find porn. And that's only because it's there when you turn it on. Our lover's spat will start a little early this month. I'll be waiting. The One Where Ross Meets Elizabeth's Dad English subtitles by Softitler Are you judging them by their covers? Because you're really not supposed to. I'm deciding which one to use. I'm going to start writing another book. Because the last one was such a big seller? Well, if you must know, I have written 14 books. And as I'm the only one who has read them... ...l can tell you that they have all been very well received. What are you doing later? Rachel and I have to get our hair cut. -We do? -I want to see what he wants first. I just found out Elizabeth's dad wants to meet me. Wait a minute. Hold the phone. You're not Elizabeth's dad? Come on, guys. I really want this guy to like me. It would really help me out if you guys could be here to make me look good. -Of course we'll help. -Thanks. We know how tough those parent-teacher conferences can be. -So, here's your office set. -Wow! Mac Machiavelli, Private lnvestigator. Let's get you to wardrobe for a fitting. When do I meet the robot? Why don't we do that right now? He's right here. Joey Tribbiani, this is-- Wow! He's so lifelike. Unbelievable. This is Wayne, the man who created and operates C.H.E.E.S.E. How do you do there, buddy? I'll let you two guys get acquainted? Sorry about that. -So where's C.H.E.E.S.E.? -C.H.E.E.S.E. is right here. Nice to meet you, Mac. -This is the temporary robot, right? -No. Why? Well, I just thought it was gonna be a really cool robot. Like the Terminator, or when I first saw you. I spent two years developing this machine. It's absolutely state of the art. Sorry. It doesn't look like it can do anything. It can do this. This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, this is Ross Geller. It's great to meet you, Paul. I prefer that Liz's boyfriends address me as Mr. Stevens. Of course. Mr. Stevens. So, Ross... ...what's your problem? Excuse me? Why can't you get a girlfriend your own age? It's funny.... It's not funny. I don't like you going out with my daughter, Ross. Okay, I can see that. I think if you give me one chance, I can change your mind. -Okay. -What? Okay. I'll give you one chance to change my mind. You've got one minute. -Daddy. -Fine. Two minutes. Go. A minute and 50 seconds. I want you to know, I have never done anything like this before. I mean, I've been in relationships in general. But I've never done it with a student. I mean, not.... Not ""it."" We haven't done ""it."" I mean, we've done stuff.... Okay. A joke. Lighten the mood. Two guys go into a bar. One of them is lrish. -I'm lrish. -And the lrish guy wins the joke. Ross! How crazy that we would run into you. Oh, my God! Thank you. I 'd like you to meet my friends. This is Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler. So you're Elizabeth's father? I can see now where she gets her... ...rugged handsomeness. Is there a Mrs. Stevens? There's a Mr. Bing! Unfortunately, Lizzie's mom passed away shortly after she was born. I raised her by myself. I get that a lot. Why don't we all take a seat? I'll get us all some coffees. Yeah, why don't you.... And you guys can talk about whatever you want. Whatever pops into your head. It is so strange seeing Ross here, this time of day... ...because usually he's at the children's hospital. But not looking for dates. Monica is Ross' sister. He's a great brother! I had a sister. She passed away. You don't have to do that every time. But Ross is a great guy. I was roommates with him in college. Funny story.... Your roommate in college died, didn't he? A part of him did, yes. Here we are, Paul, Elizabeth. I hope you guys are finding something to talk about. -Yes. We were just-- -Sorry I'm late. But I am ready to talk you up. When does Liz's father get here? I'm already here. Ross is so great! Honey, you got the kind with the little girl. You said we would get the kind with the baby. -You said the baby creeps you out. -The little girl does. -You said, ""the baby."" -Why would the baby creep me out? Why would the little girl creep you out? I'm sorry. Can you please talk a little slower. -This is for your book? -It's about relationships. You know, the traps, the pitfalls, what not to do. Keep going. This stuff's great. Excuse me. And how none of it matters when the people really love each other. And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it's a compliment. -Oh, hi! -Hi. -I left my keys here somewhere. -Well, let's look for them. Hey, look! Are these them? No. All right. -Here they are. -Good. -Thanks for your help. -Wait! Sorry! -Mr. Paul? -Just call me Paul. Paul. I just wanted you to know that... ...Ross really is a great guy. Maybe you could date him then. It would save me the trouble of killing him. Are you okay? You just don't look old enough to have a 20-year-old daughter. Well, we were very young when we had her. We? Yeah, it usually takes two people to.... Oh, no! Yes! Of course. I know that! What I meant was are you still ""we"" or are you just you? I'm just me. My wife died shortly after Lizzie was born. So you raised her all on your own? Yes, I did. How was your first day? Pretty good. Except I got a little attitude from the robot. Damn those robots. They're supposed to be our faithful servants! It was the guy who controls the robot. He doesn't like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich table... ...right when I was reaching for one. Why don't you get him fired? I may have to. I hate to do it. But I'm the star, you know? There's a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor. Excuse me. Joey Tribbiani. Joe! I'm glad I found you! I got an audition for you. The thing is, it's kind of on the q.t. The actor who has the part doesn't know he might be fired. It's the lead in a series. Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. I'm the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. Joey? Hi, Ross. I was just getting him to like you. Joey! Ross, Joey is not here. I'll just wait for him in here! Ross, it's okay. You can come out. Yeah. It's okay. It's me... ...Mr. Stevens. I didn't.... Oh, my gosh. I didn't even see you. You did. You came in, got all awkward and ran to the bedroom. You were shouting, ""Joey! "" -Bye, Rachel. -Bye. I'll call you later. -See ya! -Bye, Ross. What? What the.... How did.... What? You know, he lost his keys. So he was looking for them. In your mouth? No! Downstairs. And we got to talking... ...for two hours. I liked him. I invited him for a cup of coffee. You were at the coffee house! What's the big deal? So I kissed the guy? He's my girlfriend's father. It's weird! -You dated my sister! -That was different! -What? Why? -This is weird for me! Ross, look. This is good for you. Let's face it. So far the guy's not loving ya. But I can turn that around. I've got the inside track. We could all go out to dinner. And I could talk you up. Plus the guy is a very successful lawyer! -How is that important? -It's important! There's a million guys out there who can play Mac... ...and there's only one robot. And this one guy who controls it. I didn't know he could get me fired. What am I gonna do? You're a pretty charming guy. Thanks. But I have a problem to deal with. No, sweetie. You've got to win over the guy who controls C.H.E.E.S.E. Go back there and kiss some serious robot ass! That's not a bad idea! If I have to turn on the charm tomorrow, I'm not wasting any of it on you guys. I got some saved for you, Pheebs. Do you think Joey is more charming than me? Yeah. That's why I'm sleeping with him on the side. You wish. ""You wish."" Stop writing about us. I'm not writing about you. I'm writing about other people. -Who? -Marsha and Chester. Fine. Then you know what? I will just write about Phyllis. -""Phyllis is sitting in the chair."" -I see what you're doing. ""Phyllis sees what I'm doing."" I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter! Morning! How's my favorite genius and his robot buddy? -Don't touch him! -Okay. Level with me. I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. They even have actors coming in to read for my part. Come on, man. You gotta give me a second chance. I love this little guy. That's why you didn't want me to touch him, right? I can't believe this! God! Hey, how are you doing? So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up. So Ross selflessly offered to take me. What a nice story. So Ross was in college... ...and decided to jump at the chance to take a young girl to her prom. I definitely did not see that one backfiring. -I'm going to the bathroom. -Take your time. I was a freshman and she was a senior. So it wasn't as bad as-- Look. I know I've been giving you a lot of jabs. It's partly because I'm very protective of Lizzie... ...and partly because they just keep coming to me. I have to admit that after all the wonderful things Lizzie has told me... ...and the many stories that Rachel has told me... ...well... ...you're not... ...all bad. ""Not all bad."" I'm sorry I was so harsh. But you have to understand. I still look at Lizzie like she's a 12-year-old girl. I know what you mean. I do that, too. -I beg your pardon? -I don't see her as a 12-year-old girl. I mean, I have a son who is six and I still think of him as a baby. You have a son? My ex-wife and I share custody of Ben. Just so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms... ...as I'm sure you are with your wife. I'm sorry. It's unbelievable! Don't worry. I just didn't realize you were married. We were. But that was just a.... That was just a big drunken mistake. You're back. You two were married? I'm sorry. You were talking about Emily. We said we would meet at the coffee house at 6:00. We said 7:00. We said 6:00! The only way that I said 6:00... ...would be if I said the sentence, ""Let's meet at 7:00, not at 6:00."" If I had said 7:00, I would have said: ""My boyfriend is such a wiseass. 7:00! "" -Hi! -Oh, my good God! -I know what time you said. -What? Well, actually I know what time Chester and Marsha said. What time? What an interesting turn of events. Suddenly it's my book to the rescue. Let's see. Very interesting. Well this certainly clears things up. What does it say? I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book. Thank you for writing your book. It's a great book... ...and you are the queen of everything. Thanks. So are you. I told you I should not wear this color. ""Monica, Marsha and Chester are planning on seeing a movie Sunday night. ""Marsha thinks they're meeting at 6:00. Chester thinks it's 7:00."" -You knew we were gonna miss the movie? -That's right. Instead of telling us, you decided to write it in your stupid book? ""Marsha and Chester are mad at Phyllis."" I can't believe I'm gonna lose this job. I'm so sorry, man. Is there anything I can do? Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard. Joey, I want to talk to you. Yeah? I don't want to talk to you, Wayne. I hate you. You ruined my life. -Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler. -Hi. How are you? Joey, I'll get you your job back if you help me out. Why should I help you out? -The reason he just said. -What do you need? I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman. You know, Sarah. I wish I could talk to her. -Are you in love with her? -Yeah. Her. All of them. Anyone. Yeah. I've been there, my friend. Listen, I guarantee you keep your job... ...if you can teach me how to talk to women like you do. It's not something you can teach. It's something you're born with. You can teach it. I can show you right now. Well, if you think about it... ...Ross did learn something from each marriage. How to make the next one even shorter? Wait a minute. That's not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was to Emily. He just didn't tell me. Maybe I have to pee again. Well, this is fun. So Ross, did you kill any of these wives? I have had enough of this! I care a great deal about your daughter. And I have treated her with nothing but respect! So if you've got a problem with me-- Are you yelling at me? God, no. You know what, Daddy? lf you don't like Ross, that's fine. It doesn't matter to me. I'm going to go out with him anyway. Really? Well, if it doesn't matter to her... ...it doesn't matter to me. Still not yelling. What can I say? This doesn't make me like you more. That's okay. I'm not so crazy about myself right now either. -Then we agree? -I guess so. -Neither of us like Ross. -I like Ross. Kids! Wait. I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is. That's okay, Rach. We're not liking Ross right now. Well, I got a lot of those, too. It turns out you were right, C.H.E.E.S.E. -That shipment never made it to Omaha? -You got it. And the rabbi's beard? 100 percent horse hair. Nice catch, C.H.E.E.S.E. It's your line, C.H.E.E.S.E. Wayne! Wayne! <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"
622,"Hi, you guys. What's the matter? Well, it's just one of these situations that I just hate. You know, a massage client gave me three tickets... ...to the Helmut Peltz Exhibit at the Morgan Chase Museum. Now you're thinking you gotta sleep with him. No, it's just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us. -I'll give up my ticket. -Me, too. Okay. That's so generous. And I think Ross is generous, too. Great! Okay. Then it's just us girls. -Great. -Yeah. So what is the exhibit? It's mostly just photographs of... ...lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches. Oh, man! -Hi. -Hi. Hey, Ross. Listen. Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend. Thanks? But I have plans. Elizabeth and I are going out of town. -That's great! -Yeah. Think of all the money that you're gonna make! Why? What? Well, her father pays you for babysitting, right? No, no. That's funny. But maybe it's time to move on. You know, let it go. Stop it! Besides, Rachel's going out with Elizabeth's father. So he's much older than she is. Looks like I'm not the only one interested in fossils. Ross, all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils. Okay, okay. Rachel's gonna need to yell sweet nothings in his ear. -Ross? -Come on! That's funny, you know? 'Cause he's got like a hearing aid, you know? 'Cause he's all old. One second. Okay, look, Ross. So you know, since Lizzie likes you so much... ...l've accepted the fact that you two are dating. Really? Okay, that's great. Yeah. But then I changed my mind. I'm funny like that. I told Lizzie and now I'm telling you. I don't want you seeing my daughter anymore. All right, look. I realize it upsets you. Yes, it does. But Elizabeth and I are both adults... ...so I don't think there's really anything you can do about it. I'll inform the university of your relationship, and have you fired. A man with a plan! The One Where Paul's The Man English subtitles by Softitler This is so exciting. You get your picture back up on the wall of fame. I know. It was so cool when it was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi would just be cracking up about something. Then I get fired off Days of Our Lives and he takes me down. Now he's just laughing at me. Look at him. That smug Belushi bastard! Okay. Maybe when they put your picture back up... ...they could put you next to Matt Lauer. Look at him just smiling at me. Yeah, I know. We'd be great together. -So I'm back. -Who are you? Joey Tribbiani. From the wall? Okay, maybe this will jog your memory. Okay, anyway. I'm ready to go back up on the wall. I'm the star of a new TV show. -Show me in the TV book. -Well, it's not on TV yet. Well, then it's not on the wall yet. Okay, fine. I will bring you a tape. So, do you have any of Matt Lauer's clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that haven't been cleaned yet? Fine. I love museums. -Soaking up all the culture. -Yeah. -Where do you want to start? -The gift shop! -And then lunch. -Yes, but I can't eat too much. Paul's taking me out to dinner tonight. He said he has a big surprise planned. What do you think? Maybe he's gonna tell you he's gay? What? No, why? No reason. That would just be a really big surprise, right? You could put the aisle over here and have the wedding ceremony here. I didn't know you could get married here. This would be a beautiful place to get married. But I wouldn't put the aisle there. And I'd never have the ceremony there. You'd have the ceremony under this beautiful arch. May I help you? Sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt. It's a beautiful space. -Do you do a lot of weddings here? -Yes, we're popular. There's a two-year waiting list. Sorry. You should totally put your name down for this place. What? Are you crazy? I'm not getting married. I'm not even engaged. There's a two-year wait. What if you get engaged in two years? Then you've gotta wait another two years? That's four years. Chandler's not gonna wait that long. He's gonna find somebody else, you know? Someone who did put their name on the list. Yeah. It can't hurt to put your name down. I mean, in two years, if you're not engaged, you just don't use it. Well, I guess there is no harm in putting my name down. I'm gonna do it, too. Me, too! Really? Who would you marry? I don't know. I don't have anyone right now. Oh, Pheebs. Don't feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn't gay. Phoebe, that's not-- Don't even get me started on yours. -So, did you watch the tape of my show? -I did. -All right. Let's get me back up there. -No. You don't go up on the wall. -What? But you saw the show. -Yes. It was very offensive to my people. Dry cleaners? Russians. It showed them as terrorists and villains. Okay, okay. Look, you got Harrison Ford up there! That's right. Mr. Ford is a very good customer. He brings us a lot of clothes. You bring us nothing! Okay, that may be true. But in Air Force One, okay, the Russians were terrorists and evil! And plus, he kills a bunch of them. That's offensive to Russians. I've never seen it. You should. It's great! This place is really beautiful. Yeah. I've been coming here since I was a kid. This used to be my grandma's. The only thing I got from my grandmother was her eyes. I mean, not her actual eyeballs. But people say that my eyes look.... Do you want to make out? Sure. Are you okay? What's wrong? Yeah. I was just thinking about your father. Well, whatever works for you. No. He just really freaked me out before. So we have to hide our relationship from one more person. Big deal. Besides, we've had fun hiding it. Yeah. -Yeah? -You brought protection, right? Why? Are there like bears or something? Protection. Yeah. No, yeah. That, that I forgot. -I'll just run to the store and get some. -No. I'm the guy. I'll get it. -Do you know where the store is? -No. Do you want to ride around town on my little pink bicycle? A little bit. -I'll be back in 10 minutes. -Okay. Why don't you get in the hot tub and I'll meet you there. Okay. Oh, my God! What a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house! Thank you. It used to be my mother's. This is the kitchen. You've reached Monica and Chandler's. If you're listening to this message, we're probably screening. Yeah, we are. Hi, this is Hildy from the Morgan Chase Museum. I'm calling for Monica Geller. There's been a cancellation. If she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility... ...it is available. This is Chandler Bing! Yes, the groom! No, not the groom! It's so secluded up here. I know. That's why I like it here. I feel like we're the only two people in the world. Sorry. What's the matter, honey? -Did you see a little mouse? -No! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think l.... Actually, would you go check on that? Honey, we don't have any bears here. Well, okay. Would you get me a Diet Coke? -Okay. Be right back. -Okay. -What are you doing here? -What are you doing here? -I came with Paul! -Yeah. I recognized the ankles. Hurry up. Get out. Here you go, honey. -Thank you! -Diet Coke. Ice. I need ice. Okay. -Thank you. -Be right back. Okay. You and your ice. Get out! Get out! Go! Come on! No, not in there! Not in there! He's in there! -Did you really hear a bear? -Go! Here you go, honey. One Diet Coke with ice. Thank you. I am so happy that you're here. -Here I am! -Elizabeth! Look! Elizabeth's here! Who were you talking to? You guys? How did you know we were here? Well, she obviously saw the tire tracks that were leading up to the closed garage. Obviously. What are you doing here? Did you come up here to work on that term paper or something? Yeah. Well, why don't you go in that room and do your homework? I wouldn't do it in there. That's my dad's bedroom. That's your dad's bedroom. That's your dad's bedroom! Why are you yelling? That Diet Coke, I think, went straight to my head! Hi, honey. See you later. Wait. I bought groceries. I was gonna make you dinner. Well, next time, ask! Or at least wait for me to ask! Hi, this is Hildy from the Morgan Chase Museum. I'm calling for Monica Geller. Oh, no. There's been a cancellation. If she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility... ...it is available. Please. He didn't hear it! This is Chandler Bing! No! Can I help you? Yeah. Where's the guy who decides whose pictures go up on the wall? -He's not here right now. -You're kidding me! Well, make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani dropped off these clothes. I'm an actor. I'm trying to get my picture up there on the wall. You know, there are two people who could get your picture up there. Oh, really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks. You're the other one, right? So, are you planning on staying the night? No, no. Believe me, I'm leaving as soon as possible. Good. Not that we don't want you to stay. Obviously, you're welcome. How much more homework do you have? I just have one problem left that I do not know how to solve. Rachel, maybe you want to come upstairs and help me figure it out? Really? Okay. Okay, I'll go upstairs... ...if you get me something from the car. What do you need from the car? Surprise me. Okay. So you're gonna be in the car! I will be upstairs! And that's where everybody's gonna be! Just relax. Just relax, Paul. You're doing great. She likes you. I think she likes you. She likes you. You know why? Because you're a neat guy. You are the man. You are the man! Still got it. Still sexy. You're just a love machine. ""I'm just a love machine ""So proud of what you have, baby! "" Showtime. ""I'm just a love machine Hey, baby! "" -Phoebe? -Yeah? -Have you seen Chandler? -No, why? The museum called and said that there was a cancellation... ...and that we could move up our wedding. And Chandler heard. I know. How bad is this? Well, with a regular guy it's bad. With Chandler, oh, dear God! I know! He totally freaked out and I can't find him anywhere! -What are you gonna do? -I'm never listening to you again, for sure. ""What harm can it do to put your name down?"" -Rachel said that. -Well, Rachel's not here! Here it is! Joey, why did you sign it, ""son of a bitch""? -I didn't do that. Who would've done that? -Son of a bitch! Okay. Maybe ask this guy. You! Get out of my shop! -What did he do? -He went out with my wife! Joey! I did not go out with your wife! Okay? I went out with her. That's my wife! Get out! -Well, we should go. -Yeah. Ross? Elizabeth! Okay. I'm gonna go out this window. I'll meet you at the front door. Just tell them you're going home, okay? -Okay. -Wait, wait! No, don't go in there! Don't go in there! I need another soda! Ross! Oh, my God! What in heaven's name are you doing here? And that is why we cannot see each other anymore. Ross, you and I are gonna have to have a little talk. -Daddy, l-- -You're next! Okay. I didn't know he was here. Let's see if I got this straight. I tell you to stay away from my daughter or I'll have you fired. What you heard was: ""Take my daughter... ""...come up to my country house and ruin my weekend with Rachel."" -Okay. Please, Paul. Just let me explain. -No! Let me explain! Fired! Okay, fine. Fine. Have me fired. But, I want you to know... ...that you and I are not all that different. I mean... ...l, too, am a ""neat guy."" What? And l, too... ...am ""just a love machine."" -Let me show you where the guest room is. -Okay. I'm so sorry. Please stop freaking out. I'm not freaking out. Why would I freak out? Hildy called and said we were getting married. But that happens every day. Honey, we were at this beautiful place. And I just put our names down for fun. -I mean, what's the harm in that? -Right here. Please don't think I was trying to pressure you. -Phoebe and Rachel thought-- -Phoebe and Rachel? So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you... ...Phoebe, Rachel, Hildy, and some band called, Star Light Magic Seven... ...who are available, by the way. It was a mistake. Please don't take this to mean anything, because it doesn't. Okay. Really? Yes. If it really doesn't mean anything, because I'm just not ready. I know. I know. Okay. All right. I'm gonna go tell Joey that you're back. We were really worried about you. Did she buy it? Totally. -So did Hildy show you the place? -Yeah. It's beautiful. I can't believe you're gonna ask Monica to marry you. I know. -Hey, Gunther. -Take these cappuccinos to table 1 1 . And that guy over there wants some biscotti. Well, I just actually came in for a cup of coffee to go. Do you still work here? No. I quit a long time ago. Did I forget to tell you that? I'm sorry. -That's cool. I was gonna fire you anyway. -Great! <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"
623,"Can you help me pick an engagement ring? I don't know. Should I get her a Tiffany cut, or a princess cut or a-- Paper cut?! -Have you told anyone else? -No, I don't want Monica to find out. You told me. Because I trust you, and we're friends. . . . . .and you saw me looking at ring brochures. Once again, not knocking pays off. -I wish you hadn't been on the toilet. -Me too. -Want to go to the coffeehouse? -Oh, all right. We were just gonna see if you wanted to go. Well, we don't, because we got the other place. How rude. Sorry. Want a bite? The One With The Ring English Subtitles by Gelula/SDI So how are things going with Paul? Good. Although, you know, he's a private guy. I wish I could get him to open up. Share some feelings. You just have to think of him as a jar of pickles that won't open. I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table? That's what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone. -Watch this. -Okay. -Hey, Paul. -Hi, Phoebe. How are things going with you? Can't complain. -Hey! -Hi. -Great to-- -Ross, good to see you too. You take care. What was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off before? That was so weird, huh? Why did you do it? I didn't do it. It was Chandler. He's mad at you. -What? Why? -Oh, please. I think you know why. I can't think of anything. Come on. You're a paleontologist. Dig a little deeper. Is it because Joey and I didn't invite him to that Knicks game? Is that something he'd be mad at you for? -I guess it could. -Well, then I think that's it. If he's angry, he shouldn't hide it. I wish he'd just tell me the truth. You should run him under hot water and bang his head against the table. Honey, I made a reservation at China Garden. Yeah, that's great. But first, talk to me. Talk to me. Tell me about your day. It was fine. Okay. What are you thinking right now? That you are looking really fine in that dress. Yeah, that's great, Paul. But, you know. . . . I want to know what-- Wow, those are really great! I just want to know. . . . . .what is behind this strong, silent exterior? They say that still waters run deep, and I want to swim in yours. Are you talking about having sex? No, Paul. I don't know anything about you. Tell me about your childhood. Normal. Then how about puberty? Come on! That's always a painful time. Your pals have a slumber party and stick your hand in warm water. . . . . .while you sleep so you pee in your sleeping bag. No, that never happened to me. Well, you're lucky you never met that bitch, Sharon Majeski. Anyway. . . . The rest of your life. Any regrets? No. I'm not asking for a lot here. Just give me something. Anything. -Okay. -Okay. When I was 6 years old, I wanted a Big Wheel. And instead, my parents got me this little. . . . . .plastic chicken that you hop around on. It was embarrassing. Kids made fun of me. That was a pretty tough year. That's great! See? I already feel like I know you a little better. Okay, come on. Now we can go eat. Let's go! It was horrible. They called me ""Chicken Boy. "" In fifth grade, I got in a fight. Well, not really. Richard Danville bit me on the nose. I still have a little scar right here. You can see it. Yeah, yeah. I see the scar. I think this is really great that, you know, you've shared your feelings. It's really. . . . It's beautiful. But what do you say we go share some food? No, I couldn't eat now. What are you talking about? You love their Kung Pao chicken! Chicken? -Chicken Boy! -I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that. This is the nine millionth ring store, and I can't find the perfect ring. Ugly ring, ugly ring, ugly ring. . . . It's a beautiful selection. So maybe you don't get her a ring. Maybe you do something different. An engagement bracelet. Or an engagement tiara! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! I'm so glad I picked you to help me with this. Imagine getting down on one knee. . . . . .and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry? I'm gonna stick with the ring. This one's nice. I like it. Sir? Kind sir, can I see this one? This is the reason you brought me. I know how to haggle. Let me handle this from here. Can I help you? -I would like to see that ring, please. -Or not. Whatever. This ring is from the 1 920s. It's a one and a half carat diamond with sapphires. Sir, could I ask you to. . .? Could you hold out that ring and ask me to marry you? -Okay. -Okay. Will you marry me? Oh, my God, that's it! That's the ring! -How much is it? -I will handle this. How much is it? $8600. We will give you $1 0. -Are you interested in this ring? -Yes. But I can only pay $8000. -Okay. I can let it go for 8. -We stand firm at $1 0. -How'd you like to pay? -Credit card. Oh, no! I lent my credit card to Joey. I'll go get it. You guard the ring. Listen, I'm sorry about before. Do you have anything here for $1 0? Yes. I have these two rather beautiful. . . . . .five-dollar bills. I'll give you $1 for them. Remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday? No. -Remember, you were eating pizza? -Yeah. Chandler's angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game. We were supposed to just get him one? That guy's always mooching off of us. Anyway, I still think we should try to patch things up. We could get him tickets to another Knicks game and invite him. That's a great idea. And I still have his credit card. Here you go. Hey, hey. I got this one. Here you go. Sometimes I just don't get Chandler. We do stuff all the time without you, and you don't get all upset. -All the time? -All the time. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! -Still crying? -Like a little girl. I know, I know. This is all my fault. I wanted him to open up. I didn't know that I was gonna unleash. . . . . .this weepy, clingy, moist monster! I only know of two sure-fire ways to shut a man up. One of them is sex. -What's the other? -Don't know. Never had to use it. I'm just saying, if we're having sex, he's not talking. That's right. You're the talker. Anyway, great idea. I gotta buy him some more tissues. -We have some here. -No, you don't! Okay. I'd also like to try on the tiara. Oh, yeah. Okay. What do you think? Too much? A tad. Take the tiara back. . . . . .and let me hold the musket again. Something's missing. Let me see the ring that my friend picked out. Where's the 1 920s princess-cut ring? I just sold it to that gentleman. Oh, my God! Wait, no! Let me out! Now! Rachel? No. -How are you, Paul? -Okay. Chandler. . . -. . .did your dad ever hug you? -No. Did he hug you? No! No. It's just that my dad never did. I miss my dad. You can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads. -Hey, Chandler? -Yeah? Would you. . .? Would you hug me? -I'm a little busy here, Paul. -That's what my dad used to say. Okay. A quick one. Come on, hug it out. There you go. Okay. -Five more seconds-- -Okay! -Joey! -What? Hey, what--? Hi. Paul, is it? -Do you have my credit card? -Yeah. It's in my. . . . In my pocket. -My back pocket! -Thank God. -I got tickets to the Knicks tonight. -I can't go. It'll be fun. Me, you, Ross and. . . . Paul, probably. Chandler, I found the perfect ring. I'm gonna go with the one I picked first. Oh, wake up, Chandler. The one you picked is gone. It's over! What? Some guy bought it. I tried to stop him but they put me in jail! -They put you in jail? -The little jail between the doors! -I asked you to guard the ring! -I know! I'm sorry. But this ring is better. And Monica never even saw the other ring. Yeah. But when he proposed to me with the ring, I got goosebumps. -Maybe it was the guy. -It was the ring! -Was he excited about the tickets? -No! He blew us off! -What? -I know. I can't believe it. Can I tell you something? I'm a little mad at him now! Can I tell you something? Me too! He didn't want to talk to us about being angry? Maybe we don't talk to him at all! -Freeze him out. -Right! -I like it. -We'll show him. From now on, it's gonna be Joey and Ross, best friends. We'll be the new Joey and Chandler. Hi, I'm back. I've written down more to tell you! Oh, that's great. No, actually, that's. . . . That's great. That's really great. You know, I gotta tell you, writing, all that writing, it gets me. . . . It gets me kind of hot. Wait, wait. Listen to this: Know what I wanted to be at that age? A lover? -A surfer. -A surfer? -I wanted to be one with the waves-- -Hold on. Let me just get a little more comfortable here. Wait a second. -This isn't too revealing, is it? -No. Whatever happened to that little dude? So full of dreams. I don't care about the little dude! I can't! I cannot listen to any more of this! The only one who'd listen is a mental health professional! That's only because they get $1 00 an hour! Do you know how much money I could've made listening to you? $2000! Know when I figured that out? While you were talking! I can't believe you're trying to stifle me, when 1 4 hours ago. . . . . .we figured out that that's what my mother was trying to do to me! I'm sorry. I don't mean. . . . I didn't mean to stifle you. This is all just a little overwhelming. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to overwhelm you. It's just that when those gates open. . . . . .it's hard to close them. But they are closed now. Believe me. I'm so glad. I'm so glad you shared. And I'm glad that you're done. So what do you say we. . . . I'd really like that. That was so good! Oh, oh. I can't believe you talked me into this gumball-machine-looking ring. It's not gumball machine-looking. It's a beautiful ring! No, it's not. When I looked at the other ring, I could see Monica's face. . . . . .and see her saying yes. When I look at this, all I see is a ring. Unless I look at it really closely, and then I can see my own eye. This is the most important thing I'll ever do. I want to make it perfect. Maybe we could get the other ring back. I heard where the guy was gonna propose. Maybe we could get him to trade rings. I can't do that. You certainly can't give her that stupid gumball ring. There he is. He hasn't proposed yet. She has no ring on her finger. Wow, you're good! After this, we should solve crimes. Okay. Go get him. Oh, okay. Excuse me, sir. Could you come with me? You have a phone call. -Who is it? -It is your office. -Do you know who at my office? -John. Oh, John! Great! -There he is. -Hi. Okay. There was a mix-up at the store. The ring you have was supposed to be held for me. I'm gonna need to have that back. In exchange, I'm willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. Wow, I would trade. It is beautiful, but I'm gonna use this one. Excuse me. This is my fiance, and her heart was set on that ring. Do you want to break her heart? Yeah. Do you want to break a dying woman's heart? You're dying? Yeah, she's dying. . . . . .of a cough, apparently. It's my dying wish to have that ring. If I'm not buried with it. . . . . .my spirit will wander the netherworld-- That's enough, honey! Oh, I don't know. -Let me see it. -Great. Okay, here. -All right, I'll do it. -Thank you. And you are about to marry a wonderful man. Hey, I'm marrying a dead woman! Guys? I got something important to tell you. Guys. Guys? Guys? I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me. I think we gotta end the freeze-out. Wait. Is this for real? Yeah. Check out the ring. Oh, my God! So you two are really serious? Yeah, pretty much. You're gonna get married? We're gonna be brothers-in-law! Come here! And we're gonna be friends again. What? -Water under the bridge! Forget it! -Okay. I was gonna wait till it was official, but I had to tell you guys. You're my best friends. I think I'm gonna cry. Oh! No more crying! I just dumped one crybaby. I'll dump you too. I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, Chandler! You guys are gonna be so happy! -I know. -Where's all the tissues?! Check out the ring. Oh, nice. One and a half carat, easy. -Hey. -Hey, Pheebs. -He's gonna ask Monica to marry him. -I helped pick out the ring. You told her before you told us? She walked in while I was looking at brochures. You can understand that. Guys? Guys? <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"

You write down your offer. The highest bid gets it. I know what a silent auction is. What's going on with your hair? Why? No, it's nice. Nice to see you. So glad you brought someone. Someone? I brought people. This is Phoebe. Phoebe, this is Mr. Thompson. He's the head of my department. -And I also brought my friend Joey. -Shrimp toast! You know, I don't know where he is. I hope you're gonna bid. Actually, I was about to bid on this lovely trip to Paris. -Nice choice. -Yeah. -Good luck. -Thank you. Okay, $20. Shut the door! Shut the door! What's going on? Guys are throwing water balloons. Call the police. That's what I did to kids in my building. No, it's a water balloon fight. We started it.

Got me some drinks. -What are you doing? -Open bar. Finally, our biggest item. The 22-foot Gentleman's Daysailer sailboat. The winning bid was a whopping $20,000. I won! That was my guess! What? What? What? I guessed $20,000. Joey, it is an auction. You don't guess. You buy! What? I don't have $20,000. Congratulations on your new boat, Joey Tribbiani. Joey, sit down. Forget her. You enjoy this. What are you doing? ""One nation. . . . . .under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. "" I remembered it. The champagne is here. -Are you okay? -Yes. Yes. I'm good. Are you good? Are you perfect? Yeah. I'm okay. I'm a little cold. Can I have your jacket? No, you can't have my jacket. Because then I would be cold. If you thought you'd be cold, you should have brought a jacket. Other than that, are you okay? Are you sure you're okay? Yes. I'm fine. In fact, I've been fine for a long time now and I think. . . . . .the reason is you. That's sweet. Before I met you, I had really little life. And I couldn't imagine growing old-- Oh, my God. -I know. But let me say it. -Oh, my God. Richard. What? I'm Chandler. Oh, that's Richard. Maybe he won't see us. Richard! Monica. Chandler. I don't know why I did that. -It's good to see you. -You too. You let your hair grow. Oh, that's right, you always wanted me to. I see your mustache is back. Well, my nose got lonely. And you don't have a mustache, which is good. I'm Chandler. I make jokes when I'm uncomfortable. I'm sorry. Lisa, Monica, Chandler. We used to date. No one's supposed to know about us! See, I did it again. -Chandler, sit down. -I'll sit down. Good to see you. Your table is ready, sir. Good to see you guys. If you prefer, this table's available. That might be fun. What were you thinking? I didn't know it was an auction. I figured I'd take a guess. Help a charity. Free boat! Why would a charity give away a free boat? I don't know. Charity? Well, just buy the damn boat. Don't you think you've had enough to drink? I'm just helping the kids. How is you drinking helping the kids? Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink. Mr. Tribbiani. Your contribution brings us. . . . . .a big step closer to building the youth center. Just out of curiosity, how much is that boat worth? I think it was valued at 1 9,000. Hey, I was pretty close. So, bad news. I can't buy the boat. I don't have any money. Joey! Joey, good one! Good! Very good! -So I think I'm gonna take off now. -You can't leave, Joey! You agreed to buy that boat. It is a contract. Plus, if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me. I don't have that kind of money. I know. Okay, okay, okay, okay. This is what we'll do. We'll go to the next highest bidder, and we'll let them buy it. Then you're just gonna pay the difference. Okay. I don't know why the kids need a youth center anyway. They should just watch TV after school like I did. And I turned out fine. Not great. So we're hiding in the bathroom. . . . Then I sneak out. But before Monica can, her parents come in. I hid in the shower, next thing you know. . . . . .they're going at it on the floor. Oh, my God! I got a good one. I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy. It's so great seeing you guys again. I'd like to make a toast. As a poet once said, ""In the sweetness of friendship. . . . . .Iet there be laughter and sharing of pleasures. . . . . .for in the dew of little things. . . . . .the heart finds its morning and is refreshed. "" What? Oh, my God! You guys! Have we got a story for you. Guess who we bumped into? -Who? -Richard! I thought you were going out. I was. She was a little busy with a water balloon fight. Sometimes grownups have commitments they can't get out of. Maybe she is too young for me. When I was over there, I felt like I was a babysitter. I finally see what you were talking about. I don't know what to do. Just weigh the good stuff about the relationship against the bad. That's what I did when I first started weighing stuff. Okay, bad stuff. I'm 1 2 years older than she is. If school finds out, you're fired. -She's leaving for three months. -For camp. Okay, good stuff. Well, she's sweet and pretty and. . . . The only question you need to ask is, do you see a future? Do you see yourself marrying her? My God. You married her, didn't you? No, I didn't do that. It's just. . . . Honestly, no, I don't see a big future with her. Okay, I think that's your answer. I gotta talk to her. I hate this part. Forget Elizabeth. If you're not careful. . . . . .you may not get married at all this year. -Next highest bidder is at table one. -Great. The guy who got the Paris trip is at table four. -You care about the guy who won? -It's a trip for two. Excuse me. Is the person who won the Paris trip at this table? -That was me. -Enchant. -Is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table? -That's me. Hello. This is your lucky day, Mr. Bowmont. The Gentleman Daysailer has become available again. I believe you made a bid of $1 8,000? You have to pay that. It's not just a guess. I was actually relieved I didn't win the boat. My wife would've killed me. Are you kidding? She'll love this boat! -What is your wife's name? -It's Pam. It's Pam. Just imagine this. The Pam. I don't think she'd like that. Imagine this: The Mr. Bowmont. I don't think so. Let me paint you a little picture. You are setting sail up the Hudson. You've got the wind in your arms. You get all that peace and quiet you've always wanted. You get back to nature. You can go fishing. You get one of those hats, people call you captain. And then when you're old, Cappy. It's for a good cause. All right! -No way! It's mine! -What? The stuff you said, I want that! But, Joey, you don't have $20,000! Who cares? I'll make payments! I want the Mr. Bowmont! You're back! Let me see your hand! Why do you want to see my hand? I want to see what's in your hand, the trash. It's all dirty. You should throw this out. -What did you just do? -What happened? -Richard was there. I couldn't do it. -Oh, no. I was gonna surprise her tomorrow. Now you've ruined it. We didn't. You walk in here and ask to see her hand! A palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor. -Glove salesman. -Good one! This is terrible. What am I gonna do? She only suspects something. So just throw her off the track. I'll make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind. Convince her you're scared of commitment. I can do that. I've had 30 years of practice. Being you is finally gonna pay off! Had to go to the basement. . . . . .some idiot keeps stuffing the chute with pizza boxes. That guy's still doing that? My God, let me see your hand! No, you're too late! She already took out the trash! I have never had such a healthy breakup. She was such a grownup about it. She didn 't seem too immature for me. Did ljust make a huge mistake? Ross? Wait! Elizabeth, thank God. I was just thinking about-- You suck! What? Breakup's still on. Here she comes. Do I look like I don't want to get married? And, also, a little like a French guy. I never noticed that before. What are you up to? Just hanging out. Talking about web sites. We saw this interesting web site about marriage. How unnecessary it is. How it's a way for governments to keep tabs on you. Yeah, Big Brother. That's a little crazy. Although I am glad you're looking at other things on the lnternet. Got me thinking, why would anybody want to get married? To celebrate the relationship. To solidify the commitment. To declare your love for one another to the world. Well, that's good to know. The Mr. Bowmont's here! A customer wants to compliment you. Shall I let him in? Sure! I love this part! -Come on in. -Hi. I'm not here to compliment the chef. I hate when people come back to compliment the chef. Like I've nothing better to do. What's up? It was great seeing you the other night. Good to see you too. Came to tell me that? No. Came here to tell you something else. Came here to tell you I still love you. <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"
625,"What? What did you-- What? I still love you. I know I shouldn't even be here telling you this. You're with Chandler, who I really like. You say he's straight, I'll believe you. After seeing you, I knew if I didn't tell you I'd always regret it. Letting you go was the stupidest thing I ever did. You're really not supposed to be back here. I'm sorry. I know this is the wrong time and the wrong place. . . . . .but I had to tell you. I want to spend my life with you and marry you. I want to have kids with you. Why don't they put chairs back here? I know this is crazy, but am I too late? Yes, you're too late. Where was all this three years ago? I know. I was an idiot. And I tried to forget you. I really did. After we had lunch last year, I spent six months in Africa trying to forget. -What were you doing in Africa? -Working with blind kids. What are you doing to me? Look, l. . . . I'm sorry, but it's not gonna happen. That's fine. I'll walk away. And I'll never bother you again. Only if you tell me Chandler's willing to give you everything I am. Well, he is. I mean. . . . . .marriage is all he talks about. In fact, I'm the one making him wait. You are? Why? Why? Because of the government. The One With The Proposal - Part 2 English Subtitles by Gelula/SDI Isn't it incredible? Monica and Chandler are getting married. I know. They'll be so happy together. Two best friends in love. How often does that happen? -Not that often. -No. I'm so happy for them. Me too. So happy for them. I'm so happy and not at all jealous. Oh, no! God, definitely not jealous. I'm probably 98% happy and maybe 2% jealous. What's 2%? That's nothing. Totally. -I'm like 90-1 0. -Yeah. Me too. Have you guys seen Chandler? No. But you know who was looking for you? Tenille. So that marriage stuff you were saying yesterday? -You don't really believe that. -Sure, I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. Look at pigs. Let's take a second here and look at pigs. Pigs don't mate for life. A pig can have 1 00 sexual partners in a lifetime. And that's just an ordinary pig, not even a pig that's good at sports. Wait a minute. Are you telling me you may never want to get married? Never say never, but, probably. . . . . .yeah, never. Oh, my God. Then what are we even doing? What is this? Whoa, whoa, whoa! What is all this pressure? Is this some new strategy? Why don't you put down your copy of The Rules, huh, man-trap? You know what? I gotta go. It's okay. I got a plan. -We're gonna find love. -Definitely. Yeah, I'm pretty confident about that. That's what makes it so easy to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler. -Would be nice to have a guarantee. -What do you mean? Some people make deals with a friend. Like if neither of them are married by 40, they marry each other. -You mean a backup? -Exactly. I've got that. You do? -Who? -Joey? Joey? Are you serious? I locked him in years ago. Wait. So if neither of you are married by 40, you'll marry Joey? Yep. We shook on it. But believe me, that is not how he wanted to seal the deal. Seriously? I think his exact words were. . . . Charming. He's just a backup. Hey, Monica. Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror? It's for my boat. Cool, huh? Yeah, it's great. What's the matter? Talk to the captain. Just realizing I'm in a dead-end relationship. He's giving you a hard time? I don't want to get married tomorrow. But I want to believe. . . . . .we're going somewhere, that I'm not wasting my time. -You know Chandler. -No, I don't know Chandler. Not anymore. It's like something's changed. Maybe you changed. I didn't change. Maybe that's the problem. -What? -Chandler is a complex fellow. One who is unlikely to take a wife. Does he think I'll just wait around for nothing? Face it. Chandler is against marriage. And always will be. Well, there's some people who do want to marry me. -There are? -Yeah. Richard. Richard said he wants to marry you? -And Chandler says he hates marriage? -That's right. Chandler loves marriage! You just told me he hates marriage! That he's a complex fellow who's unlikely to take a wife! That he's against marriage and always will be! You got that from what I said? -Rach. -Hey, you. -Come on in. -Thank you. I'm so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth. Thanks. Yeah, I really thought we'd be able to make it work. I guess it just wasn't meant to be. Yeah. Love. It's a tricky business, isn't it? I guess so. So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other. . . . . .we've already slept together, so there'll be no surprises there. No, like, ""What's that?"" -Oh, you want me to be your backup. -Exactly. Yeah. I already have one. -Who? -Phoebe. Phoebe? But she just said Joey is her backup. Oh, I don't think so. I just spoke with her. She said that she and Joey made a deal. That's impossible. We have had a deal for years. We shook on it. Although, believe me, she wanted to do a lot more than that. Where have you been? I was making a coconut phone with the Professor. Richard told Monica he wants to marry her. -What? -I've been looking for you. Stop messing with her! And I would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off! -Oh, my God! -I know! They suck! He's not supposed to ask her to marry him! I am! -I know! -What--? You know what I'll do? I'll go over there and kick his ass! Will you help me? Look, us getting our asses kicked is not a solution. -Look, just go and find Monica. -You're right. I'm gonna get the ring. . . . . .I'll go find her. . . . . .and I'll propose! Dude! Dude! Dude! That coconut phone might be good for the boat. Hi. Hi. I don't know why I'm here. I didn't ask. You want to come in? I don't know. Oh, okay. I'll just leave the door open and go sit on the couch. Chandler is such an idiot! Drink? -Scotch on the-- -Rocks with a twist? I remember. You still smoking cigars? No. That's art. If it bothers you, I can put my art out. No, that's okay. So, Monica. . . . . .Iet me ask you a question. Since we broke up, do you ever. . . . . .think about me? Actually, I thought about you a couple months ago. -Really? -Yeah, but it's because l. . . . . .had an eye exam, and I don't like my new eye doctor. -Who is it? -Edward Nevsky. Yeah, he's no good. Do you ever think about me in. . . . . .a non-eye-doctor way? No. Because getting over you was the hardest thing I've ever had to do. I never let myself think about you. Phoebe, you picked Joey and Ross? You can't have two backups! Of course I can. It's just good sense to back up your backup. -Look, I've already lost Chandler. -What? Hey, Phoebe! We're both backups? How could you do this to me? What are you complaining about? You were both aware of the situation. -I was not! -No, we weren't! This kind of back talk isn't gonna fly when we're married. You can't have both. Pick one. -Pick me! -No, pick me! I don't want to end up an old maid. Well, let's see. Ross is a good father. But. . . . . .Joey has a boat. This is hard. This is crazy. I want to switch to Rachel. I want to switch too. No, wait! Wait, guys. Don't make any rash decisions. Remember my promise: If we get married, three times a week. Oh, my God. Phoebe. . . . I'm talking about massages. No, I'm not. I know how to settle this. Here's what we'll do. I'll write ""Joey"" . . . . . .on one napkin. And I'm going to write ""Ross"" on the other napkin. . . . . .and we'll pick one. That person will be our backup. Here we go. -That sounds fair. -All right. Good. Switching them up. -Pick one. -Left. -Thank you. -You're welcome. -Ross. -Joey. -We should just switch. -Absolutely. I miss this apartment. Now, this is a grownup's apartment. I should be with a grownup, you know? You're saying you need to be with someone more mature. Maybe someone with. . . . . .a license to practice medicine. Or a mustache. Let's face it. I'm not a kid anymore. I need to be with someone who wants the same things. Coming to my work and telling me you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don't want that! I think that's fair. Fair? Please. Don't even talk to me about fair. Fair would've been you wanting to marry me then. Or Chandler wanting to marry me now. Believe me, nothing about this is fair. Nothing. -Nothing! Nothing! -It's okay. Nothing. I don't know. I don't know. I know. I have to figure. . . . . .some stuff, before I can. . . . I understand. Take as much time as you want. 1 0, 20 minutes, if you need it. I'll be here. Not smoking. Where is she? I'm not scared of you. She's not here. And please come in. Scotch on the rocks. . . . . .with a twist, on a coaster. Monica? Okay, she was here. But she left. Where did she go? She said she had to think things over. Oh, my God. I can't believe this. I thought you were a good guy. Look, nothing happened. Nothing happened? Nothing? You didn't tell her you love her? Well, all right, one thing happened. You know what you did? My girlfriend is thinking things over. You made my girlfriend think! Well, I'm sorry. What's to think about? I love her. Well, apparently I'm willing to offer her things that you are not. I'm willing to offer her those things. This was just a plan. To throw her off so when I offered all these things, she'd be surprised. If it helps, it worked very well. It was working till you showed up, you big tree. This isn't fair. You had your chance with her, and you blew it! This is my chance and I won't blow it. . . . . .because we are meant for each other. And this has all just been one stupid mistake! I was gonna propose tonight. You were? Yeah, I even. . . . . .got a ring. Did you get a ring? No, I don't have a ring. You go get her. And can I give you a piece of advice? If you do get her. . . . . .don't let her go. Trust me. You know, Richard, you are a good guy. I know. I hate that. -I've gotta find Monica. -She's gone. -What? -She had a bag and she left. -What? -She was crying. She said you want different things and she needs to think. Why didn't you tell her it was a plan? I did! I told her everything. She wouldn't believe me. Where did she go? To her parents. She said you shouldn't call. But if I were you, I would. Can't believe I ruined this. I am so sorry, man. You wanted it to be a surprise. Oh, my God. Chandler. . . . . .in all my life. . . . . .I never thought I would be so lucky. . . . . .as to fall in love with my best. . . . . .my best. . . . There's a reason why girls don't do this! I'll do it. I thought. . . . Wait, I can do this. I thought that it mattered. . . . . .what I said or where I said it. Then I realized. . . . . .the only thing that matters is that you. . . . . .you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you let me. . . . . .I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica. . . . . .will you marry me? Yes. I knew you were likely to take a wife! Can we come in yet? We're dying out here! Come in! Come in! We're engaged! This is the least jealous I've ever been! Oh, no, wait! This is wrong! Ross isn't here! He's done it three times. He knows what it's about! <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"
701,"Hey, what's going on? I found a note on my door, ""Come to Monica's. Bring champagne and a Three Musketeers bar""? Yeah, I'll take that. What's up? -Monica and I are engaged. -Oh, my God. Congratulations. Where is she? I'm engaged! I'm engaged! She's been there for 20 minutes. You didn't hear? I thought it was a kid yelling, ""I'm gay! "" -Can I bring her in? -Let her stay. It's sweet. I'm getting married! I'm gonna be a bride! No, I will not shut up, because I'm engaged! Oh, big talk! Why don't you come here and say that to me? My fianc will kick your ass.

Okay, to Monica. Have you decided on a band for the wedding, because I'm kind of musical. She got engaged a few hours ago, I doubt she's had time to think-- Speaking of chiming in, remember burning my apartment? Yeah, you're on your own. We should get dressed up and go have champagne at the Plaza. I can't stay too long. I gotta get up early for an audition. I gotta look good. I'm supposed to be playing a 1 9-year-old. What? So when you said get up early, did you mean 1 986? You guys don't think I look 1 9? Oh, 1 9! We thought you said 90. Okay, everybody, let's go. Is my candy bar around here? No, you ate it all. I was afraid of that. You know what shoes would look great with this ring? Diamond shoes. You're not getting dressed. Know what I mean? Yeah, but I don't think we have time. There's gonna be a wedding. You're gonna be the bride. 200 people are gonna be looking at you in a clean, white dress. Let's do it. Chandler, it happens to lots of guys. You're tired, you had a lot of champagne. Don't worry about it. I'm not worried. I'm fascinated. You know? It's like biology. Which is funny, because in high school I failed biology. . . . . .and tonight biology failed me. Check it out. I could play this while the guests are coming in, okay. First time I met Chandler I thought he was gay But here I am singing On his wedding day Phoebe, no. If you'd let me finish, it goes on to say that he's probably not gay. You guys don't have this problem, you're made of wood. Hey, you look great. Thanks. You okay over there? I don't know. You know? I feel a little. . . . You know what? Never mind. I'll be fine. Don't worry about it. You're probably tired, you had a lot of champagne. It happens to everybody. -Happy Monica's Night. -Well, thank you. You too. Can you believe they are actually getting married? Well, sure, but I get married all the time. -You okay? -Yeah, I guess. Do you think we'll ever have that? You mean ""we,"" you and me? Oh, no, no, no. ""We,"" you with someone, me with someone. Good, you scared me a minute. I know. Shake it off. It's just because you and l, we were like a nightmare. -No, but there were some good times. -Absolutely. Like there was. . . . -Surely you can think of something. -Just give me a minute. Oh, well, yes. I can think of one good thing. You were always good at the. . . . . .stuff. I was good at the stuff? I really liked your hands. My hands? Way to go, guys. You were really good at the stuff too. Oh, I know. Hey, you know what we never did? Oh, no, not that. We never had bonus night. -A what? -You know, bonus night. Two people break up, but they get back together for one night. One night, just sex? No strings attached? Yeah, yeah, we never had that. No. Okay, this is getting a little crazy. I'm sure it would be amazing. . . . . .but I really don't think it would be a good idea. I really. . . . . .really. . . . . .don't. 'Sup? 'Sup, dude? Take whatever you want, just don't hurt me. You playing a little PlayStation, huh? That's whack. PlayStation is whack. 'Sup with the whack PlayStation, 'sup? Come on, am I 1 9 or what?

And please, please, keep my underwear. Thanks. You've had a lot of sex, right? When, today? Some, not a lot. The reason I'm asking is because I had kind of a-- I was unable to-- I really wanted to, but I couldn't-- There was an incident. Don't worry about that, man. That happens. -It's happened to you? -Yeah, once. -Well, what'd you do? -I did it anyway. Phoebe, come on, let's go. Come on. Why aren't you dressed yet? I wrote the best song for your wedding. Check this out. If you get ready now, you can play. -Really?! -Yes. That's so exciting! Thanks, Mon. But if you touch my guitar again, I'll have to pound on you a little bit. Fair enough. Get ready. I'll get everybody. Finally we can start celebrating my-- I'm sorry, apparently I opened the door to the past. Okay, Monica, Mon. Okay, what you just saw-- Can I ask you just a little question? Why tonight? I waited my whole life to be engaged. . . . . .and unlike some, I only plan on doing this once. Maybe it's selfish, I'm sorry, but I hoped tonight could just be about that. But it is just about that. Now it's about you getting back together. See, you kind of stole my thunder. We did not steal your thunder. We are not getting back together. Yeah, no, and you know what? Nobody even saw. That's true. -We just kissed. -It was just a kiss. You guys kissed?! What does this mean?! Are you back together? Can I sing at your wedding? Thunder being stolen. -Phoebe, it's nothing. -Let's not make a big deal of this. It was a one-time thing. It doesn't even matter. Oh, my God. I cannot believe you guys are talking about this. Problems in the bedroom are between a man and woman. All right? Now, Chandler is doing the best he can. I don't think that's what they were talking about. What a great night. Chandler can't do it, they kissed. -What? -You guys kissed? This is huge. No, it's not huge. People thinking it's huge has led Monica to believe. . . . . .we're stealing her thunder, which we aren't. We're still talking about it. That, and Chandler's problem. Monica, listen, listen. Would you feel better if we stopped talking about Ross and Rachel? -That would be lovely. -You got it. Now, I can pass for 1 9, right? Yes, you can pass for 1 9. -Really? -Yes. -Seriously? -Seriously? Seriously, no. Okay? You can play your own age, which is 31 . I'm 30! Joey, you are not. You're 31 . Oh, crap! So, the Plaza. We'll get some mai tais? Maybe no more for you though. You know, I think I don't feel like going to the Plaza. Monica, this is ridiculous. I don't want to talk about it. I don't. Especially with you. That is whack. I'll play it at the wedding. We'll see if they actually let you play. They tell you anything you want to hear. . . . . .Iike, ""You look 1 9. "" Then they just take it away, like, ""No, you don't. "" Monica won't take this away. -Wouldn't she? -Would she? Would she? You ate my candy bar! Guess who. Hey, I just realized we kind of left some stuff up in the air. What did Monica mean: ""I don't want to talk,"" especially with me? Why not especially you and me? We were both kissing. Still thinking about it? I'm serious. What did she mean by that? ""Especially you. "" -Who cares? -I care. And so do l. I have to talk to her. Will you let me get changed? Am I going to let you watch me? No. I can't believe her. It's just so typical. I know you're upset, but don't forget there is going to be a wedding. You are going to throw the bouquet, and then a honeymoon. -Maybe in Paris. -Paris? We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la blah-blah-blah. Keep talking. We will sprinkle rose petals on the bed and make love. . . . . .not just because it's romantic, but because I can. I love you. Don't say anything, you might scare it away. It's Paris. Who knows we're here? Hi, Pheebs. What's up? You said I could sing at your wedding, so I need a small deposit. You know, some good-faith money to hold the date. We're not giving you a deposit for our wedding. Oh, I see. They break your heart, don't they? You know, I don't really need their permission. You want to sing at their wedding, sing at their wedding. Yeah, and if you want to look 1 9, then you-- You got to do something about your eyes. What's wrong with my eyes? They give you away. There's too much wisdom in there. Put some tea bags on them for 1 5 minutes. -That'll get rid of my wisdom? -Maybe 1 0 minutes for you. Give her the deposit, give her the ring. I don't care. What did you mean when you said. . . . . .you didn't want to talk to anyone, especially me? What a great apology. And you accept it. Bye-bye. No, seriously, what was the ""especially me"" part about? Let's just say it's not the first time you've stolen my thunder. Hey, here's a thought. . . . Monica, what are you talking about? My sweet 1 6. You went to third base with my cousin Charlie. Third base. It was all everybody could talk about. The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring. We had a caricaturist. Whenever I get married Guess who won 't be asked to sing Somebody named Geller And somebody else named Bing Monica, your sweet 1 6 was like a million years ago. Yet here you are doing it again. I don't want to steal your stupid thunder. Why else would you have made out with Ross? Got me. Easy, mimey, the moment has passed. It ain't gonna happen. It'd be nice if I could have this night. I never wanted any part of your night. No one was supposed to see us. Is that why you did it in the secret hallway, where nobody ever goes? Rachel, I've been thinking. I don't think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I'm calling it off. Way to save your dignity, my man. Mon, why, why would I ever want to take away from your night? I don't know, maybe you feel a little resentful. Maybe you thought you'd get married first. Maybe you can't stand. . . . . .that your formerly fat friend is getting married first. Oh, wow, that-- You know what? That is so unfair. Now I want to steal your thunder. Come on, Ross. Let's go have sex! I can't believe you're gonna have sex on my engagement night. Well, somebody should. Look, if we're gonna do this-- We're not. She's just gonna think we are. I see, so everybody wins. -Who is it? -It's Monica, open up. Okay, Ross, stop it. Please, wait a minute. Yeah, you like that, baby? May we help you? I wanted to say I hope you have sex, and I hope you get back together. I warn you, the night you announce your engagement. . . . . .I'm going to announce that I'm pregnant. How is that ever going to happen? Do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight? -I know why. -You don't. -Okay, why? -Because I was sad. What do you mean? Look, I am so. . . . . .so happy for you guys. But you getting married reminds me of the fact that I'm not. I'm not even close. Maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. I know that that's dumb, but you were so depressed. . . . . .when Ross got married, you slept with Chandler. I don't care, she slept with me. Anyway, sweetie, I am so sorry I ruined your night. I'm sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross. I'm gonna take off. -Congratulations, man. -Thanks. And Rachel. . . . . .what can I say? You missed your chance. From now on, the only person who's going to enjoy these bad boys is me. We thought Phoebe would leave But she just stayed and stayed That's right, I'm here all night And Chandler will never get-- Hey, here's a dollar. Consider it a deposit. Please sing at our wedding. Thank you. Now who will perform the ceremony Who will perform the cer-- I'll pound on him in the morning. <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"

I guess it's because I'm engaged! -When will that start getting annoying? -Start? Let's start the wedding plans. -Okay. -Already? We got a lot to do. We gotta think about the flowers, the music-- -I have thoughts on the music. -Too many cooks. . . . Take it from me. All you have to do is show up and say the right name. -What in God's name is that? -Oh, my God, the wedding book? I haven't seen that since 4th grade. This baby has everything.

The One With Rachel's Book English Subtitles by Gelula/SDI That conclusively proves. . . . . .that I had the idea for Jurassic Park first. Let's take a look-- Phoebe, what are you doing here? I need to talk to you. It's urgent. It's about Monica and Chandler. Oh, my God. Of course. Would you please excuse me for a moment? Do you know each other's hometowns? Why don't you. . .? What's going on? Well, not much. I was just thinking that since they just got engaged. . . . . .it would be nice if they have privacy. So could I just move in with you for a couple days? Okay, sure. But what's wrong with Monica and Chandler? Nothing. Why? Phoebe, you said it was urgent. Yeah, it is. My movie starts in five minutes. Do you realize I have a classroom full of students? Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movie? I haven't cleared the budget with my parents. . . . . .but tell me how this is for music. A string quartet for the processional, a jazz trio for cocktails. . . . . .the Bay City Rollers for dancing. . . . Wait, that was for my 6th grade wedding. You couldn't get them anyway. Ian doesn't play anymore, and Derek. . . . Derek is a name I shouldn't know. Mon, do you have another pillow, something a little snugglier? Why are you napping here instead of at your place? -The duck. -What, the duck? What the hell did the damn duck do now? Well, he did not get sick somewhere in there. . . . . .and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up. Do I get to look at this book. . . . . .or is it just for people involved in the wedding? Of course you can look at it. I want your opinion. Here you go. -What about centerpieces? -Centerpieces! -Roses or lilies? -Definitely roses. I think they're more ""wedding-y. "" -But lilies are the clear choice. -Oh, my God, it's like one mind. Guys, guys, you gotta let me nap. I'm gonna get cranky. Joey, there's a perfectly good couch across the hall. Yes, it is perfectly good. . . . . .and it is not one of the places the duck got sick. What? -All right, I'm gonna go. -Joey, what did the duck do? I don't know, but he did not eat your face cream.

I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I don't know what the big deal is. I don't want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment. . . . . .when I want to kick back with a puzzle-- Beer, cold beer. Hey, Joey. What are you doing? Sweeping. Why? Does it turn you on? No. What if I was sweeping a chimney? Joey, did you eat my face cream? Where are you going? The vicar won't be home for hours. Joey, where did you learn that word? Where do you think. . . . . .Zelda? -You found my book?! -Yeah, I did! Joey, what are you doing going into my bedroom? I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't have, but you got porn! You know what? I don't care. I'm not ashamed of my book. There's nothing wrong with a woman enjoying a little erotica. It's a healthy expression of female sexuality. . . . . .which, by the way, is something that you will never understand. You got porn. -Hello. -Hi, is Phoebe here? -No, she's out for the night. -Oh, great! Can I help you with something? I don't know. Are you a masseur? Yes, I am. Great! Dad? Thank you so much. I'll pick him up in an hour. Your parents must've been thrilled when you told them you were engaged. Oh, yeah. I should probably call them. I remember when we first got engaged. -I've never heard that story. -Dad, you don't-- Well, I'd gotten Judy pregnant. I still don't know how. You don't know how? Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy. What a sweet story. At least you're not hearing it at your 5th grade Halloween party. They wanted a scary story. We're really excited about our wedding plans. Pretty soon we'll be making a big withdrawal from the wedding fund. -What? -You tell her, Jack. I can't do it. You have the wedding fund, don't you? We have it. Only now we call it ""the beach house. "" You spent my wedding fund on the beach house? We're sorry. We assumed. . . . . .that when you turned 30 you'd pay for it yourself. You bought the beach house when I was 23. So you've had seven years of beach fun. . . . . .and you can't put a price on that. We do feel bad about this. We saved again when you dated Richard. Then that went to hell, so we redid the kitchen. What about Chandler? It was Chandler. We didn't think he'd propose. I didn't start drinking enough at the start of the meal. I can't believe there's no money for my wedding. Maybe, if your father hadn't tried. . . . . .to sell ice over the lnternet. -It seemed like such a simple idea. -Stupid. The word is ""stupid. "" Enough. I don't want to hear about it anymore. Good luck, Chandler. Okay, now I'm going to. . . . . .touch you. That's soft. Do you think your parents could help pay for it? I don't know. My mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. Saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has, he saves for his yearly trips to. . . . . .Dollywood. -What happened at dinner? -My parents spent the wedding fund. My God, what did you order? Wait, there's no money? Well, this is terrible. You guys will have to get married in, like, a rec center. -Honey, it's gonna be okay. -No, it's not gonna be okay. -No swing band, no lilies. -It's gonna be okay. I mean, you don't need to have this. . . . . .rustic ltalian feast. You don't need this custom-made. . . . . .empire waist, duchess satin gown. You can wear off-the-rack. It's really gonna be okay. The important thing is, we love each other and we're gonna get married. Do you even understand what ""off-the-rack"" means? Why don't you pay for it yourself? How? I don't have any money. -I have some. -How much? Well, close to. . . . -Are you kidding me?! -How much? -Enough for wedding scenario A. -Really? How great are you, you little saver! This is exactly the budget of my dream wedding. You guys are so made for each other. You're not suggesting we spend all the money on the wedding? Yeah. Look, Mon, I've been saving this money for six years. . . . . .and I have some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party. Wow! Hello, Mr. Chandler. Sweetie, this is the most special day of our lives. I realize that, honey, but I won't spend all the money on one party. Honey, I love you. But if you call our wedding a party one more time. . . . . .you may not get invited. We can always earn more money. We're only gonna get married once. I understand, but I have to put my foot down. The answer is no. You're gonna have to put your foot down? Yes, I am. Money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get onboard with. CENTRAL PERK -Hey, Rach. -Joey. Hey, Rach, do you smell smoke? I get it. Smoke, chimney, chimney sweep. Very funny. Ha, ha. No, no, I'm serious. You don't smell it? Something's on fire. I don't smell anything. You know what? It's probably just your burning loins. -Hey, what are you guys talking about? -Nothing. Damn, this coffee's cold. Do you mind if I heat this on your loins? You know, I cannot believe you told him. Joey. . . . I guess you bought that book after we broke up. I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you. Oh, yeah? Well, when we were going out, I read tons of porno magazines. 'Sup? Ross, how could you do that to an old man? Excuse me, ladies. I'm sorry? My massage client. Arthur. His daughter said some guy that worked for me. . . . . .gave him a really weird massage. I gave him an extremely professional massage. He said you poked at him with wooden spoons. Okay, so it wasn't a traditional massage. But I did give him acupressure with a pair of chopsticks. . . . . .and I gently exfoliated him with a mop. Well, he's never coming back. You just cost me $80 a week. This is your fault. You didn't move his appointment. Oh, it's my fault? You didn't have to massage him. You could've sent him away. You could've not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back. He said he liked that! You're right, you're right. I'm sorry. Dude, what are you massaging an old man for? -His daughter was hot. -Gotcha. Listen. . . . . .I've been thinking. It's not fair of me to ask you to spend all your money on our wedding. I mean, you work really hard for that. -Well. -Well, you work for that. Look, I've thought about it too. I'm sorry. I think we should spend all the money on the wedding. -You do? -Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Look, when I proposed, I told you. . . . . .that I would do anything to make you happy. And if having the perfect wedding makes you happy. . . . . .then that's what we're gonna do. You are so sweet. What about the future and stuff? Forget about the future and stuff. So we only have two kids. We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college. -Have you thought about that? -Yeah. How many kids were we gonna have? Four. A boy, twin girls and another boy. What else did you think about? Well, stuff like where we'd live, you know. Like a small place outside the city. . . . . .where our kids could learn to ride their bikes. We could have a cat that had a bell on its collar. . . . . .and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. We'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old. You know what? I don't want a big, fancy wedding. -Sure you do. -No. I want everything that you've just said. I want a marriage. You sure? -I love you so much. -I love you. When you were talking about our future, you said cat. But you meant dog, right? -Totally. -Good. Hello, Zelda. -Who are you supposed to be? -The vicar. -Do you even know what a vicar is? -Like a goalie, right? Look, that's enough. You make stupid jokes and sleazy innuendoes. . . . . .and it's just not funny anymore. I'm sorry. Rach, I'm sorry. Maybe I could make it up to you by taking you roughly in the barn. All right, that's it. You want to do it? Let's do it. That's right. I want to do it with you. Been trying to fight it, but you said all the right things. I did? Yeah, I been waiting for so long to get on that body. -This body? -Yeah, that's right. Come on, Joey, sex me up. You're starting to sound like the butcher's wife in chapter seven. Come on, now. Don't keep me waiting. Take your clothes off. But I'd keep that helmet on, because you're in for a rough ride. I don't want to. I'm scared. <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"
703,"Hey, guys. So, what do you think? -About what? -What? Are you kidding? Okay, I'll give you a hint. Eyes. No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandler's eyes! I got glasses. You always had glasses. No, I didn't. Are you sure? Didn't you have a pair? They were really round and burgundy, and they made you look kind of. . . . -Feminine. -Yes! No. I think the glasses look great. You look sexy. -Really? -Yeah. You didn't think I wore glasses? Of course. The One With Phoebe's Cookies English Subtitles by Gelula/SDI What do you want for an engagement gift? That's okay, we're not having a party. . . . . .so you don't have to get us-- If someone wants to give us a present, we can't deprive them of that joy. You should get them a little CD player. I already have one. Unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist. Yeah, and by ""someone"" she means Joey. I know what I want! -What we want, honey. -No, you don't want this. I want your grandmother's cookie recipe. You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe? The one my grandma made me swear on her deathbed. . . . . .that I would never let out of our family? Dying people say the craziest things. I've wanted it for years. I was gonna make cookies for my children. Break my heart. Oh, all right. I'll be the mom who makes the world's best chocolate chip cookies. Our kids are gonna be fat, aren't they? Ahoy! -How's the boat? -I'm getting into this sailing stuff. You finally took it out of the marina? Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there. If you don't sail it, what do you do on it? It's a great place to just sit. . . . . .hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips. It's good that you finally have a place to do that. I could teach you to sail if you want. -You could? -I've been sailing my whole life. When I was 1 5, my dad bought me my own boat. -Your own boat? -He was trying to cheer me up. My pony was sick. -You know what I was thinking? -What? Nothing, I just like to go like this. -What are you doing tonight? -Do you have a lecture? -No, why? -Then, free as a bird. What's up? My dad wants to know if you want to play racquetball. Great! Dad must like you! He doesn't ask just anyone to play. He didn't ask for you. He asked for ""Chauncey. "" I assumed he meant you. Did you correct him? No, I thought it would be more fun this way. Cool! Maybe you could do this every week. Or you could sit on the porch. . . . . .and make sure no one steals the trashcans. He does that every week too. Just so you know, you have to let him win. He hates to lose. Maybe I'll play with my left hand. You're not a lefty? Does anybody know me? What's wrong? I went to my old apartment to get the cookie recipe. . . . . .and that stupid fire burned it up! No! Why didn't you make a copy and keep it in a fireproof box. . . . . .and keep it at least 1 00 yards away from the original? Because I'm normal. That was the one legacy my grandmother left me. And I know you wanted it as an engagement present. We have to get you an engagement present? Don't worry about it. No one got me an engagement present. I don't have the recipe, but here. I wish you health and happiness. An old cookie? This is what happens when you don't register for gifts. I made a batch and froze it. This is the only one left. We can't accept this. Why not? Cause it's gross. No, wait. I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie. I do this at work all the time. -Really? -I think so! Okay, Ross, we owe you a present. Two! I've been engaged twice. Look at this clown. He thinks he can take up the whole river. Get out of the way, jackass! Who names their boat Coast Guard, anyway? That is the Coast Guard. What are they doing here? The coast is all the way over there. Joey, just ignore the boats. -We're not finished with our lesson. -All right. I'm gonna go over the basic points once more. Come on, Rach. I got it, okay? I want to go over there. . . . . .where that boatload of girls is. Is that it? You want to give. . . . . .a shout to the hot chicas? Okay, let's do that, Sailor Joe. Quick question, though: What's this called? -Boat rope? -Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up? Rub it? No. What do you do if I say we're coming about? I say, ""Come again?"" I know this one. I know this one. Time's up. Now you're dead. And deaf! You go on and make your little jokes. If you don't know what you're doing. . . . . .you will die. Am I getting through to you? -Yes. -Don't just say yes. This isn't a game. You could get hurt out here! Do you want to pay attention, or do you want to die? I want to make a ship-to-shore call to Chandler. -I definitely taste nutmeg. -You do? You don't? Well, that's the difference. . . . . .between a professional and a layman. That and arrogance. Hey. Hey. How was sailing? I don't want to talk about it. You could've at least saved me a cookie. Women are mean! I can't believe that. Now the only thing left of my grandmother's legacy is. . . . . .this crumb. I wish you a long and happy marriage. -Hey. -How was it? Well, I had a great time. Chauncey on the other hand. . . . I will tell the story. It was going great. I let him win, we were bonding. . . . . .he even said I could call him Dad. And what did he ask you not to call him? ""Daddy. "" Look, here's the story. We hadjust finished playing, and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the room... ...and it's really steamy. So I take off my glasses, and that's when it happened. Guys? -Over here. -Have a seat, son. Hey! -Oh, my God! I can't believe it. -I know. You gave my father a lap dance. Why do they put so much steam in there? Because otherwise they'd have to call it the ""room"" room. Why? Why did that have to happen? Come on, it's not that big a deal. Not that big a deal? There was touching of things. I know you wanted to bond with my dad. . . . . .but did you have to bond to that part? I'm sure Dad doesn't care. He probably thought it was funny. He'll be telling this story for years. I don't want him to tell this story for years. Oh, but he will. He still tells the story about how Monica tried to escape from fat camp. I wasn't escaping. Then how'd you get caught in the barbed wire? I was trying to help out a squirrel. You were trying to eat it. If that is your father calling to tell this story. . . . . .then the marriage is off! Come on. Hello. I'm sorry, you have the wrong number. I'll call you later, Dad. I love you. I'm off to see your dad. Aren't you a little overdressed? You better make sure he tips you this time. I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore. . . . . .and I figured the best way to do that was face to face. And by ""face,"" I don't mean his lap. And by ""face,"" I don't mean my ass. Are you getting Monica and Chandler a present? I don't know. You know, they didn't get us anything. Thank you! Hey. Well, hello. So when are we getting back out on the water, matey? I don't know the boat way to say this, but, never. Why not? Because you're mean on the boat. I was just trying to teach you. Well, lesson learned. Rachel is mean. Yep, yep, yep. I remember when she took me out on her dad's boat. She wouldn't let me help at all. Excuse me, I wanted you to help. But you couldn't move. . . . . .because you were wearing three life jackets. You have to respect the sea. Joey, I'm sorry if you thought that was mean. But I tell you, that was not mean. My father is mean. He used to always yell at me on the boat. It was horrible. I was being a really good teacher. Does a good teacher say, ""Put down the beer, pinhead! "" Does a good student drink 7 beers during his first lesson? Six and a half. You knocked the last one out of my hand, remember? I didn't want you to get hit by the boom. Well, it hit me anyway. It would have hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer. I'm sorry. I will try to tone it down and stop yelling. No bossing me around? -I won't boss you around. -And be nice? -I'll be nice. -You'll be topless? -Joey! -You want me to learn? Here's batch 22. Maybe these are like your grandma's. This has a bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg. Let's give it a shot. I haven't made so many cookies since 9th grade. What for, a bake sale? No, just a Friday night. These are pretty good. Yeah, but not as good as batch 1 7. Which one was that? The ones we had after you almost threw up. Oh, yeah, batch 1 7 was good. I did not like batch 1 6. I'm okay. Any more from the good batch? We could work off those. I think there's one left. Batch 1 6. Sixteen, people, get out of the way! Okay, Joey. You're doing really good. I just need you to step to the portside. Remember talking about the portside? Oh, yeah. No. It's left, sweetie, but that's okay. That's a tough one. Why not just say left? Okay, go to the left. The left. Just sit over there! You're yelling again. See that? Oh, no, no. Very quiet. Said with love, no yelling. You know what? Since I'm here, I'm gonna have a beer on the portside. See what I did there? We're luffing a little. Can you tighten up the Cunningham? You just said a bunch of stuff I don't know. Joey, come on! We just went over this. We did that when that bird. . . . . .flew over with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross. I did not see the bird or the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat. Which obviously is an impossible thing to do. You're yelling, and I don't see you taking your top off. I quit! -What do you mean? You can't quit. -Why not? You're not finished! I won't have it. Greenes do not quit. Greenes? I'm a Tribbiani. Tribbianis quit. Oh, my God. I just said, ""Greenes don't quit,"" didn't l? Did I say, ""Greenes don't quit""? Yes! And you're still yelling at me. No, I'm not yelling at you. I'm just yelling near you. Oh, God, Joey. I'm my father. Oh, my God. This is horrible. I try so hard not to be my mother, I didn't see this coming. I'm so sorry. I just wanted you to learn. I did learn. -Really? -Yeah, come on. It's okay. I know what a mainsail is. I know to duck when the boom comes across. -I know port is right. -Left. Damn it! It would make my grandmother happy. . . . . .that we're trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she's looking up at us and smiling right now. Looking up? She was really nice to me but she's in hell for sure. Well, I've tried everything. I give up. I'm not gonna be the mom. . . . . .who makes the world's best cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli raab. Kids love that, right? Isn't there any relative that has the recipe? What about your sister? No. I made a promise to myself that the next time. . . . . .I would talk to Ursula is over my dead body. And that's not happening till October 1 5, 2032. That's the day you're gonna die? I've got shuffleboard that day. That's what you think. What about friends of your grandma? Wouldn't they have the recipe? I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got it from her grandmother, ""Nestley Toulouse. "" What was her name? Nestley Toulouse. Nestl Tollhouse? You Americans always butcher the French language. Phoebe, is this the recipe? Yes! Oh. I cannot believe that I spent. . . . . .two days figuring out that recipe. It was here the whole time! I know! You see, it is stuff like this. . . . . .which is why you're burning in hell! So you understand. I'd feel better if you didn't tell what happened. I'm a little embarrassed about it. I understand completely. Nothing's scarier than embarrassing yourself. . . . . .in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started dating Judy, I was unemployed. Her father asked me what I did for a living. I said I was a lawyer. -What'd you do when they found out? -They never did. So if you ever see me giving them legal advice, just nod along. Shall we? So, I guess we wear swimsuits in here. Well, Joey, I hate to admit it. . . . . .your way of sailing is a lot more fun. Why don't you give a pull on that rope? We're not sailing. -Just pull on it. -All right. Sandwiches! What else? Here you go. -Thank you. -Oh, wow. -What are you doing? -Sorry. Not like that. You're letting all the good stuff fall out. Careful! You're wasting good pastrami! Oh, my God. I'm my dad! <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"

Really? So tell me what happened to Ross, junior year at Disneyland. No, I can't do that. I'll tell you what Phoebe said. -Okay. -Okay. So Ross and I are going to Disneyland. We stop at this restaurant for tacos. When I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about ten tacos. Anyway, we're on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy. Oh, my God. He threw up? No, he visited a town a little south of throw up. What was Phoebe's secret?

But I hired you. -What? -Yeah, you got the job. -You're my new assistant. -I am? Yeah. -I can't believe it. -Me either. First, I need you to go downstairs. . . . . .find a woman named Hilda, and tell her to go home. -Hey. -Hey, good you're home. Always nicer to hear than, ""Oh, crap, you again.

Just figuring out what to do for dinner. Hey, what's that? Dinner stuff? You making dinner? No. What's over there? Tacos? No. No. They're just ground beef smileys. Those are tacos. Excuse me, Mr. Mexico. Either way, I'll pass. Still can't eat those. What's so funny? I'm not laughing. You told her! Nancy Thompson's getting fired. Okay, okay. I had food poisoning. It's not like I chose to do it! It's not like I said, ""What would make this ride more fun?"" Right. You're right, I'm sorry. I shouldn't be laughing. I should be laying down papers for you. -How could you? -I had to. We're getting married. Married couples can't keep secrets. I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City. Dude! -What happened? -Chandler and I are in a bar. . . Did you not hear me say, ""Dude""? . . .and this girl is making eyes at Chandler. So he goes over to her and, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. You're thinking he's not the type to go to bars and make out with girls. And you're right. He's not the type. . . . . .to go to bars and make out with girls. You kissed a guy? Oh, my God! In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy. Oh, Mon, I laughed so hard-- So hard we had to throw out your underwear again? Whatever, dude. You kissed a guy. -Hi. -Hey. How's Hilda working out? Oh, my new assistant is working out. Yes. She happy she got the job? My new assistant is very happy that I hired my new assistant. Hello. Oh, hey! Can you hang on a second? It's the producers at Mac and Cheese, if you'll excuse me for a minute. Hey, funny you should call. I was just looking over next week's script. Canceled! Like, they're taking it off the air? All right, I'll see you Monday. We're not even shooting them anymore? All right. Bye. They canceled Mac and Cheese! -Sorry. -Sorry, Joey. Why would they do that? It was a good show, right? You want to tell secrets? Okay, in college. . . . . .Ross used to wear leg warmers. All right, Chandler entered a Vanilla lce look-alike contest and won. Ross came in fourth and cried! Oh, is that funny? You find that funny? Maybe Chandler should know your secrets too. I already told him everything. You shush! Once, she was sent to bed without dinner. . . . . .so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she'd made. Ross stayed home every Saturday night to watch Golden Girls. Monica couldn't tell time until she was 1 3. It's hard for some people! Of course it is. Wow. -Chandler wore my underwear to work! -Hey! I'm sorry, I couldn't think of any more for Ross. In college, Chandler got drunk. . . . . .and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm. That was you. Whatever, dude. You kissed a guy. How could this happen to me? Yesterday, I had two TV shows. Today, I got nothing. Wait a minute, what happened to Days of our Lives? Well, they might be a little mad at me over there. What happened? Well, maybe I got a little upset, and maybe I told them where they could go. Joey, why would you do that? Because! They wanted me to audition. You, an actor? That's madness! Rachel Green's office. Tag. Hi, who was that? Nobody. I was just practicing. Really? -Hi. -Hi, Rachel Green's office. You must be Hilda. He's Tag. This is Phoebe. Phoebe, can I see you for a sec? Phoebe. -Great name. -You like that? -You should hear my phone number. -Okay. So you hired yourself a little treat, did you? I know how it looks, but I am telling you-- You can't get involved with your assistant. I know that, and I know hiring him was not the smartest thing I've ever done. But, from now on, I swear this is strictly professional. -Yes. -Hey, Rachel. Hi. Cute assistant. What's his story? -Is he-- -Gay? Yeah. Hey, Terry. Joey Tribbiani. Surprised your big head could fit through our small halls. -I gotta go, Joey. -Wait, Terry! Look. I'm really sorry about before. I was an idiot, thinking I'm too big to audition for you. -Give me another chance. -I can't. Wait, Terry, please! Look, I just lost my other job, okay? You have no idea how much I need this. Please, help me out. For old times' sake. This guy's been in a coma for five years. It's hopeless. It's not. Dr. Stryker Ramoray is a miracle worker. Here he comes. Good morning. Drake, it's your brother, Stryker. Can you hear me? And cut. I'm back, baby! You know, in my defense. . . . . .there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue. And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me. -Do you have trouble telling time now? -No. -Quick, what time is it? -Time to kiss a guy? What are you laughing at, Pampers? You know when I said married people. . . . . .should share everything and not have any secrets? -Yeah? -That was stupid. Let's not do that. Absolutely. We should keep the stuff we told each other secret from everyone else. Yeah, definitely. Okay. If you'll excuse me. . . . . .I'm gonna hang out with people who don't know the Space Mountain story. -Then I'd steer clear of Phoebe. -Man! Not that you would, but I wouldn't hang out with the guys at my office. Hi. -Do you have a minute? -Sure. What's up? I got asked out twice today while I was at lunch. . . . . .by guys. -Really? -Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay? Oh, did you not want people to know that? I'm not gay. I especially wouldn't want you to think I was gay. Why is that? -I don't think I should say. -Oh, you can say. Come on, I don't want you to feel like you can't tell me things. -Okay. -Okay. -Well. . . -Yeah. . . .I'd love to ask out your friend Phoebe. Yeah, she's gay. <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"

They're announcing our engagement in the paper. -We're looking for a good picture. -I'm afraid that does not exist. There are great pictures of us. No, there are great pictures of you next to a guy who's going like this. . . . Oh, my God, that's the creep that you're with at the Statue of Liberty. I don't know what it is. I just can't take a good picture. MONICA: Here's a great one. -Yeah, I'm not in that. -No, but look at me, all tan. Why don't you get portraits done by a professional photographer? That's a great idea. I bet they have one of those wind machines. Yeah, that's great. Next to that, Chandler won't look so stupid. -Chandler, what do you say? -All right, but I'm not going. ""I'm"" going. The One With The Engagement Picture English Subtitles by Gelula/SDI Dude, that reverse lay-up. -And how about those three-pointers? -Amazing. And those guys were this close to letting us play this time too. Hey, look. Phoebe's talking to Cute Coffeehouse Guy. You call him ""Cute Coffeehouse Guy""? We call him ""Hums While He Pees. "" Yes, and we call Ross ""Lingers in the Bathroom. "" Hey, you guys, ""Hums While He Pees"" just asked me out. -I thought that guy was married. -He's getting divorced. Ross, maybe you know him. It's not a club. If he's getting a divorce, is it a good idea to date him? -Hey, divorced men are not bad men. -That's on the napkins at the club. -I gotta go to work. -You don't have to go for a half-hour. My assistant, Tag, does sit-ups in the office during lunch. I could just spread him on a cracker. Rach, why would you hire this guy? -You know you can't date him, right? -I know that. We joked that we spend so much time together. . . . . .he should call me his ""work-wife. "" Soon he'll be able to call you ""that lady he knew that got fired. "" I won't get fired, because I'm not gonna act on it. You wouldn't mind if he was dating someone? Why, is he? He is, isn't he? He's dating that slut in marketing. Maybe I should open a divorced men's club. Dude, that's so sad. I could put a basketball court in the back. Could I play? Oh, no sit-ups today, Tag? -I just did them. -Well, drop and give me 1 0 more. What? I had a drink with lunch. -Did those cost reports come in? -I did them last night. Could you make me 4 copies? -Sure. -Great, thank you. Huh. Oh. -Hey, Rachel. -Hi, Melissa. What's up? I'm just about to go out to the store. Get some stuff to put in my backpack. Dried fruit and granola, and stuff like that. -What's up? -Is Tag here? No. Why? I was gonna talk to him about tonight. Really? You got a little crush on Tag there, do ya? We've been flirting back and forth. . . . . .but I was hoping tonight it would turn into something a little more. Easy there, Melissa. This ain't a locker room, okay. But you know, I remember him saying that he had plans tonight. -Oh, no. -Oh, yeah. All right, back to work. Hey, isn't that Tag's backpack? I don't want to be known as the office bitch, but I'll call your supervisor. PHOTOGRAPHER: Great, that's great, Monica. Great. Now, Chandler, you want to give us a smile? Okay. -I'm sorry, is the seat uncomfortable? -No, I am. Chandler, I know you can do this. You have a beautiful smile. -I do? -Yeah. Maybe you don't have to smile. Let's try something else. -Try looking sexy. -Okay. Or not. Hi, Joey, what are you doing here? I got an audition down the street, and I spilled sauce on my shirt. -You got an extra one? -Yeah, sure. Here. Great. You got anything that's not Ralph Lauren? Yeah, I don't think so, Joe. I guess this'll be fine. -What are you doing tonight? -Nothing. Why? How would you feel about taking out Tag? I'll pay. It's gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude. I'm not asking you to go on a date with him. Really? Because I could kind of use the money. He's new in town and he doesn't have any guy friends. Take him to a ball game or something. I'd appreciate it. -Yeah, okay, no problem. -Thank you. Ooh, hey, doughnuts! I know. Let's try a look. . . . . .of far-off wonderment. Gaze into our future and think about our marriage and the days to come. Chandler, what is the matter with your face? This picture should say ""Geller and Bing to be married"" . . . . . .not ""Local woman saves drowning moron. "" (LAUGHS) Hey, don't laugh at him. He's my drowning moron. That's it, that's it! Take it, take it! I like this one. It seems to say, ""I love you and that's why I have to kill you. "" Can't all be bad. Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. There it is. Oh, my God, those are my bedroom eyes? Why did you ever sleep with me? Do you really want to pull at that thread? -I'm having a good time. -Me too. Sorry that guy on the subway licked your neck. No, that's okay. He's a friend. I don't mean to be presumptuous. . . . . .but I have tickets to the ballroom-dancing finals tomorrow. Yeah, l-- Well, I missed the semifinals, so I think I would just be lost. I know it's lame, but I got these tickets from my boss-- Oh, no, no, no, my God! Okay, don't freak out. I'll go. It's my ex-wife, Whitney. I cannot deal with her now. She's crazy. Okay, I know. Hold on. -Hey, Ross. -Yeah. That's Whitney, Kyle's ex-wife out there. Do you think you could divert her so we could slip out? What? No. Okay, but I have two tickets to the ballroom-dance finals. I don't think so, Pheebs. All right, I'll do it. -But just because you're a friend. -Okay. Oh! Hi, Ginger. I want my key back. -I don't have it. -It's right there. Okay, Sherlock. I'm sorry, but you'd better go. I just wanted to thank you for diverting Kyle's ex. You're welcome. We'll talk about it later. -Hi, Whitney. -Hi, Ross. -Are you ready for breakfast? -Yep. Kyle's ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her, not date her. Can you give me a second while I talk to this woman. . . . . .who, by the way, did not spend the night? -Sure. -Okay. I did divert her, and we ended up having a great time, okay? Watching ballroom dancing? Yes, that's where we realized we were both super cool people. Look, Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her. Like what? Like she's really mean, and she's overly critical and-- She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you. Okay. And she uses sex as a weapon. Thank you for warning me. At breakfast, I'll be on alert for room painting and sex weapons. -You're still gonna go out with her? -Yeah. Well, didn't you hear what I just said? Pheebs, come on. I mean, consider the source. Of course her ex-husband's gonna say that stuff. Now if you'll excuse me. Listen to me, she is crazy! WHITNEY: Your door isn't soundproof. You see? Nothing is good enough for her. -Morning. -Hi, Tag. -Did you have fun with Joey? -Yeah, we went to the Knicks game. That's nice. Then we went to a bar, and he hooked us up with all these women. Women? You mean, like old women? Kind of old, like 30. I never used to be able to talk to girls in bars. . . . . .but I got like 20 phone numbers last night. That's great. Joey must have really taught you some stuff. A little. How you doing? See? That's a great smile. Easy, natural. Now pretend I have a camera. -You're changing it. -I can't help it. You want to know what I do when I take rsum shots? Borrow money from me? Yeah. Okay, first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. So here's what I do. I look down, look down, keep looking down. Then I look up. See? Now you try. Look down. You're looking down. Keep looking down. Why is there jelly on your shoe? I had a donut. -Hi. -Hey. So, I heard you had some fun with Tag last night. Yeah, that guy's all right. Yeah, and you had fun teaching him how to be all ""Joey. "" -What? -You know, all the women. You can't teach someone to be good with women. That's why I never had any luck with Chandler. I'm right here. Would you mind just not going out with him again? Just the idea of you and he and all these women-- I know he's my assistant, and we can't date! But it bothers me, all right? No, no, no, you can't take him away from me. I got a great partner to pick up girls with. Finally! I'm still right here. Will you talk to him. . . . . .and tell him how unsatisfying this dating-tons-of-women thing is? What? I don't want him to meet anybody until I'm over my crush. I will get over it. It's not like I love him. It's just physical. I get these crushes all the time. I had a crush on you at first. I know. Monica told me. Did you have a crush on me when we first met? Yeah, sure. Can you people not see me? Will you talk to him? -I don't know, Rach. -I'll give you 1 0 Ralph Lauren shirts. One. No, 1 0. You said 1 0. You can't take that back. You wanted to talk to me? I don't know. You got something for me? Yeah, this is from Rachel. Ten. Okay. Tag, there's such a thing as too many women. -Really? -Yeah, for you. -Hey, there you are. -There I am. -You okay? -Yeah, Joey said I needed to relax. So he gave me an antihistamine. What? I fell asleep on the subway and went to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is far. What were you thinking? But don't worry, because I know how to take a picture now. Okay, see. Look down. Look down. Look down. -Chandler? -Yeah? -Hi. -Hi. How are things going with Crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet? Listen, you are hearing one side of the story. Okay? FYl, she must have shown Kyle over 30 paint samples. . . . . .before she painted that room. And his response to each one was, ""I don't give a tiny rat's ass. "" Maybe she should have spent a little less time decorating. . . . . .and a little more time in the bedroom. I don't think we are going to have that problem. . . . . .but maybe it's because I am not emotionally unavailable. You think he's emotionally unavailable? I think he can be. Maybe he wouldn't be. . . . . .if she didn't bring the office home every night. Excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life. Well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year's Eve 1 997. I knew you were going to throw that in my face! That was three years ago. She apologized and apologized. What more do you want?! We want the last 6 years back! So do we! So do we! I'm sorry you had to see that. -Morning, Rachel. -Hi. Hey, so, what'd you do last night? -Went out with Joey. -Yeah? Another night of bird-dogging the chicas? No, we had a really good talk. I don't think I'll do the bar scene anymore. Wow, I did not see that coming. It's just not really who I am. I've always been happier when-- Why am I telling you this? -You don't care about this stuff. -Yes, I do. You were saying, ""I'm happier when l. . . . "" When I'm in a relationship. -I love having a girlfriend. -Really? Someone I can spoil, you know. Spoil? -Let me ask you something. -Uh-huh? Do you believe there's one perfect person for everyone? I'm starting to. And if that person's in your life you should do something about it? Yes. Hell, yes. -All right, then, it's settled. -Okay. -I'm getting back together with my ex. -I would love to! What? Hello? Oh. This is gonna be a while. Excuse me. Yeah. (PHOEBE TAPS SPOON) My God! Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking of being selfish in bed, how's Whitney? Maybe she wouldn't have to be selfish in bed. . . . . .if someone else knew where everything was. Oh, he knows. For the most part. Oh, hey. Good, you're both here. We kind of need to talk. -Both of you together? -What's up? Well, I went over to Kyle's last night to pick up a few things. . . . . .and we got to reminiscing. KYLE: We talked most of the night. . . . . .and realized the reason we're angry with each other. . . . . .is because there are still feelings there. So. . . . Oh, just say it, Kyle! We're gonna try again. What about her whining, and her constant need for attention? I'll work on that. Right, because you're so capable of change. You know, he hums when he pees. -I do know. -Makes him miss the bowl, but whatever. We're so sorry. That's all right. We don't need you. I'm over it already. Yeah, and I don't even give a tiny rat's ass. Yeah, we're gonna go. I'm sorry. Pheebs, you were right about her. You know, she did try to use sex as a weapon. Yeah, I hurt my back a little. You know, he hums while he does other stuff too. We're better off without them. Even if they break up again, you better not let him in your sad men's club. -Divorced men's club. -Po-tay-to, po-tah-to. Hey, guys, check it out. -My mom sent me the paper. -Let's see it. -Oh, yeah, that looks good. -You make a very attractive couple. -Yeah, we look great together. -We really do. Okay. Imagine what our kids would look like. We don't have to imagine. I'm marrying her. We'll just see. <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"
706,"The reason I asked you to brunch. . . . . .is because I've been thinking about my maid of honor. Oh, my God. This is it. Oh. I hope it's you. -I hope it's you. -Me too. First of all, I love you both so much. -You're both so important to me. -Blah, blah, blah. Who is it? I was thinking we could come up with a system. . . . . .where we trade off being maid of honor. -Hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine-- -Yes! Oh. Hypothetically. Still. If Phoebe were mine, Rachel would be Phoebe's, I'd be Rachel's. We all get to do it and no one gets upset. -That's a pretty good idea. -I'll do that. So, who's yours? Well, that's the best part. You guys get to decide. -Why is that the best part? -I don't have to. Of course we'll help you decide. We'll do anything we can to help you. I'd like to make a toast. To the future Mrs. Chandler Bing. . . . . .my best friend and truly one of the nicest people that-- -Really not deciding. -Fine. Excuse me, I couldn't help overhearing. -You're marrying Chandler Bing? -Yeah. Good luck! Oh, and good luck to you too! What a nice lady.

Yeah, I just got plans. Well, John McClane had plans. I want to leave before Joey gets all worked up. . . . . .and starts calling everybody ""bitch. "" What are you talking about, bitch? -Hey, Rachel. -Yeah? When I get married, will you be my maid of honor? Really? Oh, my God, Phoebe. I mean I'm just-- Wait a minute. If I'm your maid of honor, that means that you are Monica's. Oh. Well, if that's what you want. No way, Phoebe. I want to be Monica's. -Why does it even matter? -Why does it matter to you? Because this one is now. And it's two of our best friends. And who knows what you're gonna marry. What if I marry Ross? Or Joey? You wouldn't. Okay, look, Rachel. I know you really want to do this. . . . . .but I've never been maid of honor to anyone before. I know you've done it at least twice. -Yeah, but Phoebe-- -Please let me finish. I guess that was it. Okay. Since you've never done it before, you can be Monica's maid of honor. Oh, thank you so much! Yay. I'm gonna marry someone good. Oh, I know. Better than Chandler. -What happened? -I don't know. We fell asleep. That is all. Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. All right, well, I'd better go. -I think that would be best. -Yeah. -I'll talk to you later. -Okay. -But not about this. -No, never. Never! -Bye. -No touch. No touch. Hey, a weird thing happened at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you. . . . . .and she wished me good luck. That's sweet. No, it was more like a ""good luck. "" So, what did this woman look like? She was, like, 30, dark hair, attractive. Any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror? Was it someone you dated in college? No, I only dated two girls in college. . . . . .both blond, both not attractive. Let me check this out. -What are you doing? -Well, let's see. Okay, is that her? Oh, my God, yes! -Who is she? -Julie Graff, my camp girlfriend. Did you break up with her? No, we're still together. We went out for two summers and then I broke up with her. -Why? -She came back the third summer. . . . . .and she'd gotten really fa-- -Fat? -I did not say fat. I said fa-- You broke up with a girl because she was fat? Yeah. Yeah. But it was a really long time ago. Does she still feel bad? Apparently she does. You know what they say: ""Elephants never forget. "" Seriously, good luck marrying me. Hey, what's going on? She's Monica's maid of honor. Hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs. You have been maid of honor before? You see? This is exactly why you shouldn't lie. That's it. I am maid of honor. -No, I am. -How come you are? Because I cared enough to lie. Hey, I could help you decide who should do it. We could have an audition. See how you'd handle maid-of-honor-type situations. -What do you mean? -When I want a job. . . . . .I audition and if I'm the best of the people they see. . . . . .I get the part. So, okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it? Oh, me and Ross can be the judges. -It's better than us deciding. -Oh, this is crazy. -Can't we just flip a coin? -No, coins hate me. Okay, fine. You know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide. Hi! Ross, sweetie. Hey there, handsome thing. Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Giorgio. Hey. Just brought back your videos. Hey, Ross. Look, I think we need to talk about before. No. No, we don't. Yes, we do. Now, look. That was the best nap I ever had. I don't know what you're talking about. Come on, admit it. That was the best nap you ever had. I've had better. Okay. When? All right! All right! It was the best nap ever! I said it, okay? But it's over, Joey! I want to do it again. We can't do it again. -Why not? -Because it's weird! Fine. You want a drink? -Sure. What do you got? -Warm milk and Excedrin PM. Chandler. I just figured out who you are. Can you figure out what I'm doing? -You're Louis Posen. -Who? He was my best friend in fifth grade. One day, I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why? Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom? No, but because he thought I was too fa-- Every time I think about it, I feel as bad as I did then. I really think you should apologize to Julie. Honey, are you kidding? That was like 1 6 years ago. It would make me feel better if Louis apologized to me. I'll do it. But I warn you, this may make me a better person. And that is not the man you fell in love with. Okay, we'll give you hypothetical maid-of-honor situations. You'll be scored on a scale of one to ten. -One being the highest. -Ten is the highest. -Why is 1 0 the highest? -Because it's the highest. Okay, Rachel, you're up first. Situation number one: You're with Monica. The wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go! I don't want to marry Chandler. -I've got cold feet. -It's gonna be okay. One man the rest of my life? I don't know. This means I'll never get to sleep with Joey. Look, Monica. . . . . .getting cold feet is very common. It's just because of all the anticipation. And you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don't get to keep the gifts. Drawing on your own experience. Very good. Yes, very nice, Rachel. Thank you, judges. -Kiss ass. -Oh. -Okay, Phoebe. -Yes, Your Honor. We're now in the ceremony. Monica is about to say, ""I do"" . . . . . .when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go! When Monica was a little girl. . . . . .I remember that-- Ow! -Very good! -Oh. Yes, excellent. Perfect score. She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony! Hey, you want a little taste of Pheebs? It is time for you to give your maid-of-honor speech. We haven't even prepared-- -Go! -Okay, okay, okay. Webster's Dictionary defines marriage as-- Okay, no! Forget that! That sucks! Okay, never mind. Forget it. I met-- I met Monica when we were just a couple of 6-year-olds. . . . . .and became friends with Chandler when he was 25. . . . . .although he seemed like a 6-year-old. Oh. Thank you. Thank you very much. I've known them separately and together. To know them as a couple is to know that you are in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass. . . . . .to Monica and Chandler. . . . . .and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey. Wow. -Great speech. -Yeah, it really was. Oh, thanks. Okay, Phoebe, I guess you're next. Although I really don't see the point. Okay. I can't believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married. I remember talking about this day with Rachel. . . . . .while we were showering together, naked. And she's back in the game! Julie. Hi. Chandler Bing. I guess you remember me. Hello, Skidmark. It's a nickname. I'll explain later. It's pretty clear. I owe you a long, overdue apology. I shouldn't have broken up with you because of your weight. That's why you broke up with me? You didn't know that? Well, I guess my work here is done. First of all, I would like to say you both performed very well, okay? You should be proud. And I'd also like to say, in this competition, there are no losers. Well, except Rachel. Damn it! Really? I won. -What? -I'm sorry, Rach, it was really close. -Well, then I demand a recount! -Actually, it wasn't that close. You know what? Your thing was so stupid anyway. We're gonna flip a coin, all right? Heads. What? The coins have finally forgiven me! Know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her. . . . . .vegetarian-voodoo-goddess-circle-y shower. Rach, it's gonna be okay. You guys are the best! Boy, I tell you. That judging stuff took a lot out of me. -Yeah? -Yeah. Thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch. Why would I care about that? No reason. I'm just saying that. . . . . .that's where I'll be. As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I'm going to apologize for all the stupid things that I do. Why don't you just stop doing stupid things? -Then you wouldn't have to apologize. -I'd love it if I could do both. All right, I have to ask. What? Will you break up with me if I get fat? What? You broke up with Julie. How much weight did she gain? A hundred and forty-five pounds. In one year? My God, what did she eat? Her family? That's not the point. I know it was a stupid reason to break up with someone, but I was 1 5. Yeah, well, that's not the only time this was an issue. You remember when you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat. Wait a minute. -That was totally different. -How? You were not supposed to hear that. I said that behind your back. What if I have babies, okay? I'm gonna look different. I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure you are. You have to realize I don't think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. This is one of the things that I can apologize for later. What I mean is, you're Monica. Okay? And I am in love with Monica. Keep going. So you can balloon up or you can shrink down. . . . . .and I will still love you. Even if I were to shrink down to 2 inches tall? I'd carry you around in my pocket. I love you. Skidmark still got a way with the ladies. Hi, Pheebs. -Hi. -Hi. I just want to apologize. I'm really sorry I was a baby. That's ridiculous. Rachel, we were all babies once. Oh, you mean today. Yeah. Yeah, and you know, you deserve to win. And I was thinking about it. If you're Monica's maid of honor, I get to be yours. -Oh, yeah. -Yeah. When Monica and Chandler got engaged, I put some stuff together. -Just in case. -Oh, that's so sweet. Thanks. Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. Oh, God, this is funny. Look. Here's a picture from one Halloween when she dressed up as a bride. She made me carry her train. . . . . .which was weird because I was Wonder Woman. Oh, and here's a little purse that I found. I just thought they could hold the rings in there. -Oh. -Something. And. . . . . .vintage handkerchiefs, you know, because people cry at weddings. I'm just gonna grab a couple of these. This stuff is great. I forgot this was in here. This was the garter that I was saving for my wedding. And I wanted it to be Monica's ""something borrowed. "" And it's blue. Rach, I think that you should be Monica's maid of honor. You do? -Why? -Because I think it means more to you. But, Pheebs, honey, you earned it. It's fine. I mean, this is something. . . . . .that you've been thinking about since you were, what, 1 4? No, I was 1 0. I just developed early. Man alive! -Hey, what's going on? -Hey! We decided Rachel is going to be your maid of honor. Oh, that's great! Oh, wow. Okay, we really have to start planning. I have really specific ideas. We should meet four times a week. Come to my place, we'll get together before work. What do you say, 6:30, my place? So excited! Yeah, okay. You laugh now. She's gonna be yours. Great nap. It really was. What the hell are you doing? God! Excuse me. <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"
707,"-Morning. -Hi. How was your date? -Pretty good. -Oh, good. My God. Sorry about that. Okay, really good. I gotta go. I'm late. You're going to leave her with me? Don't worry, she's a terrific girl. Can you do me a favor? Could you mention I'm not looking for a relationship? That'd be great. What, are you kidding? Just casually slip it in, you know. Lay the groundwork. Tell her I'm a loner. No, an outlaw. She doesn't want to get mixed up with the likes of me. That's a lot to remember. Can't I tell her that you're a pig? I'm gonna call her later myself. Honest. Chandler used to do it. He'd make her pancakes. Plus he'd make extras and leave them for me. I'm not telling her anything. It's not my responsibility. Fine. Now, where did we land on those pancakes? -Hi. -Hi. Sorry, but I couldn't get that lock to work. Yeah, Joey kind of disabled it when I moved in. -You must be Rachel. I'm Erin. -Hi. I don't mean this to sound like high school, but did he talk about me? Would you like some pancakes? The One with Ross' Library Book English Subtitles by Gelula/SDI -Come on. Why are we here? -Okay, okay, take a guess. The hot chicks? Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier. . . . . .you know, for fun. And I typed mine in, and guess what came up? My doctoral dissertation. It's right down here in the biggest library in the university. Wow, that's actually pretty cool. There's also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina. What is that? Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system. We're so sorry. You didn't bring me here to do that, did you? She sent the chicken back again? She said it's too dry now and wants to explain to you how she wants it. I'd like to meet this chicken expert. Send the colonel in. Oh, my God! Lucky bastard. -Janice. -How are you. . . . . .Ms. Hotshot-Chef-at-the-Big-Fancy- Restaurant-With-the-Best-Chicken-Ever? I'm fine. Oh, what is that on your finger? I'm blind. So who's the lucky guy? Oh, my God. I am so sorry, sweetie. Are you okay? You didn't tell her we're engaged? -She saw the ring. -Did she freak out? She was shocked, but then again, so were most people. She actually has a boyfriend herself. Name's Clark. She also invited herself to our wedding. Clark too. You said no, right? You said no, right? She cornered me. She asked me if the wedding was in town. -What was I supposed to do? -Lie. How hard is that? ""Your check's in the mail. "" ""Oh, your baby's so cute. "" ""I can't wait to read your book, Ross. "" So she comes to the wedding. Maybe it won't be so bad. Think she'll sit quietly? Think she'll want to make a toast? You don't think she'll want to sing ""Part-Time Lover""? Oh, my God. She's not gonna like the chicken either, is she? You know what? It'll be okay. She's probably not gonna even want to come. -Really? -No, that was a lie. See how easy that was? So you would have just lied? Yes. -It would have really been that easy? -Yes. Do it Saturday. We're having dinner with her and Clark. Hey, what's up? Hey, who's your friend? -Hey, Joey. -Erin. You're still here. We ended up spending the day together and had such a great time. Why wouldn't you? Erin is great. And then there's you guys. Well, listen, I better get going. Today was great. Thanks. And Joey, last night was fun. Yeah. I'll call you. -I'll call you too. -Or I'll call you. -And call me. -Okay. Good to see you again. -Bye-bye. -Bye. The system kind of broke down, huh? Joey, I'm sorry. I just couldn't tell her all those things. And we got to talking, and l-- We want you to marry her. What? She is so amazing. You have no idea. Who do you think brought her here? Cupid. She's so cool. She speaks four languages. Man, do you know what guys want. Come on, she's so perfect for you. She's sweet. She likes baseball. She had two beers at lunch. My beers?! Look, she's a very nice girl. We had a very good time, but I don't see it going anywhere. You always say that. Maybe if you gave her a chance, it would go somewhere. I'm sorry, you guys. I just don't think so. -Whatever. -Fine. Hey, don't start judging me. You're in love with your assistant. You're sleeping with the guy who keeps pigeons on the roof. Phoebe! Secret affair. People are doing it in front of my book. I'm sorry? My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school. I went to see it. And there were students making babies right in the paleontology section. Oh, my God. Did you get to see anything good? At your school. . . . . .was there a place on campus where students went to fool around? Yeah, there was. In the corner of the library where all the books were that nobody ever read. Yes, there was. Great, because people kept showing up. I think it's like a thing. Hold on a second. Fifth floor, against that back wall? Oh, for crying out loud! -So we should go catch our movie. -What's the rush? I'd like to see the previews. The candy. -Oh, hey. -Well, look who's here. -Hey, Joey. -Hey, Erin. -Hey, Rachel. -Hi. We were about to take off and see a movie. -Oh, no! -What's wrong? Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to. Oh, no. What party? A birthday party. Whose birthday party? Alison's birthday party. And how old is Alison? Thirty-two. Wait a minute. Why don't you guys do something? Look how that worked out. Excuse me. Hi, I'm a professor here. Do you know the paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437? Well, yes. Just give me five minutes. I just have to find someone to cover my shift. No, no, no. Can I speak to someone in charge? How can I help? Hi, I was wondering, is it possible to increase security. . . . . .in the paleontology section? I wrote a book that's up there. And instead of reading it, people are. . . . Well, they're rolling around in front of it. We are aware of the problem you're referring to. As far as increasing security, I'm afraid the library's understaffed. I can't help you. Well, fine. If I'm the only person with any appreciation. . . . . .of the sanctity of the written word, then I'll go defend it myself. Don't you follow me. -How did it go with Erin? -Unbelievable. We had the best time. -So you're not mad anymore? -No, no. You guys were totally right. This was much better than the first date. It was awkward. We were both nervous. -Didn't you sleep together? -Yeah, that calms me down. And we have so much in common. She loves sandwiches, sports. Although she is a Met fan. Not an issue now, but if we had kids. . . . Oh, my God! Listen to you talking about having kids. Oh, my Joey. Please don't get married before I do. I just cannot believe that Clark stood me up. He may still show up. What are you, stupid? -It's been three hours. -Is that all? Let's go on to happier things. Why don't you tell me about your lovely wedding. There was something that we wanted to tell you about the wedding. It's going to be a small ceremony. Tiny. We're not even sure why we're having it. It's actually going to be just family. Oh, wait. You two think of me as family? I have to ask you something now, and be honest. Do you want me to sing ""Careless Whisper"" or ""Lady in Red""? How can you say that? The Mets have no closer. -What about Benitez? -What about game one of the series? -What about shut up? -You shut up. I love arguing with her. -Be right back. -Okay. How's it going with Joey? Oh, okay. Okay? Tell me that you like him, please. I mean, tell me that you like him. He's a really great guy, and I know you really want this to work out. . . . . .but I just don't see this having a future. But you said that you liked him. What happened? Did you just change your mind? -Kind of. -Then change it back! I'm sorry. It's just, there's no real spark. Didn't you sleep together? Yeah. Tramp. Does Joey have any idea? I don't think he does. You know what? Maybe you could tell him I'm not interested. . . . . .in a serious relationship. You mean, like, that you're kind of a loner? Yeah, that'd be great. And maybe that you're a real stronzo. I'm sorry. I guess ltalian isn't one of the four languages you speak. -Hey. Want to go? -Yeah, let's go. -Okay. See you guys later. -Bye, guys. Hey, thank you so much. Wow. I guess it wasn't cupid that brought her here. No, just a regular old flying dwarf. Yes, yes. How can I help you? We were just looking around. Oh, you're fellow scholars. What exactly were you looking for? Perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's musings. . . . . .on the Smilodon californicus? Get out of here! Meeting someone? Or are you just here to brush up. . . . . .on Merriam's views on evolution? Actually, I find Merriam's views far too progressionist. I find Merriam's views far too progressionist. I'm sorry. Who are you? I'm a professor here. Ross Geller. Ross Geller? Why do I know that name? It's a. . . . Wait. Did you write this? Yes. You're the person who checked out my book? You know, you look nothing like I would have thought. You're so young. Well, I skipped fourth grade. I am very, very sorry. -So how was your date? -Great. We walked around the Village. We went to this ice cream place. Split a milk shake. Seventy-thirty, but still. I'm thinking of taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts. Really? She said she wants to go? No, it's a surprise. It's gonna be tricky, because she's busy at work. Joey, look, honey, we need to talk, okay? I got the feeling from her. . . . . .that she's not looking for a serious relationship. -Where are you getting this? -She told me. She said she's kind of a loner. -Joey-- -Hey, Rach, it's cool, you know. I'm a loner too, right? Hey, Joey. You know what? You are way too good for her. I promise, next time I will tell them you're not looking for a relationship. No, don't do that. Just. . . . -Next time, make sure she likes me. -Well, that too. Joey? -Do you want some pancakes? -Finally. What are we gonna do? I say we go with ""Careless Whisper. "" Chandler? Did she see us yet? Did she see us? Janice, what are you doing here? I thought I was gonna go back to my apartment. . . . . .but I just felt like I really couldn't be alone tonight. I was just wondering if I could maybe stay here with you. Just, I really feel like I need to be with family. Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice, aren't they? Please. Because otherwise, I really don't know what I might do. Aren't you just a teensy bit curious? -You have any tissues? -Yeah, in the bathroom. We'll just let her stay. No. If we let her stay, she will stay forever. -Kind of like your Barcalounger. -Is that what you're thinking about? I never stop thinking about it. Hey, you guys? Do either one of you want to get in there before I take my bath? Janice, I'm sorry. . . . . .but you can't stay here tonight. Why not? Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed. . . . . .for electromagnetic activity. Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly. . . . . .you have not. I'm gonna need a comforter. Do you have a hypoallergenic one? Because otherwise I get very nasal. Do you have a cat? Because it's already happening. Do you hear that? Listen. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! You have to go. Why? Because Chandler still has feelings for you. He does? Say again? That's right. That's right. And that is why you can't stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn't come to the wedding. Feelings. Such strong feelings. I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away. . . . . .but you can. Oh, my God. I understand. I am so sorry. I'll go. Goodbye, Monica. I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him. Chandler. You call me when this goes in the pooper. I've got this section covered. Yeah, in fact, I've got this baby to shine in people's eyes. Okay, see you later. I just wanted to show Monica your book. <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"
708,"- Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving. - No, no, no. Are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year? We're playing a game I learned. You have to name all the states in six minutes. What? That's like insanely easy. It's harder than it sounds. You always forget one. Or in some cases, 14. It's stupid and I wasn't playing with people, so technically, I didn't lose. You forgot 14 states? Nobody cares about the Dakotas! Okay, time's up. All right, I got 4<i>8</i>. That's not bad. Pheebs? I got tired of naming states, so I listed the types of celery. And I have one, regular celery. So Rachel's got 4<i>8</i> and Phoebe has the lead in... ...vegetables. Joey? Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game. - Wow, how many you got? - Fifty-six. The One Where Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs English Subtitles by Gelula/SDI Hey, how is New England not a state? They have a sports team. Does South Oregon have a sports team? There you go. Why one extra place setting? You invited your assistant. Oh, right, sorry. Tag's not coming. His girlfriend came into town, so he's with her. Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own sweet potato stuffed pumpkin. I was going to, but then I figured... ...your food is so delicious and perfect... ...you can never have too many of those pumpkin things. You'd think I wouldn't enjoy that since it's so fake, but I still do. Regular celery! I already have that. Done... ...with time to spare. - This may be a new world's record. - I hate to lecture you guys... ...but it's disgraceful that a group of well-educated adults... ...and Joey can't name all the states. You ever see a map or one of those round colorful things called a globe? Magellan? You got 46 states. - What? That's impossible. - Forty-six. Well, who's well-educated now, Mr. L-Forgot-Ten-States? I'm going to go turn on Joey's oven. Please, watch him. Do not let Joey eat any of the food. I am only one man. - Okay, time is up. - Now, just give me another minute. If you don't know them by now, you never will, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself. This is crazy. I can do this. All right, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner. Okay, but if you can't, no dinner. You're on. Don't look at my list, because there's a lot on there that you don't have. Did you know your oven doesn't work? The drawer full of takeout menus is okay, right? Ross, I'm gonna use yours. Chandler, give me a hand. Joey, do not let Ross look at maps or the globe in your apartment. Don't worry. It's not a globe of the United States. I'm gonna go out and take a walk. Phoebe, why is your bag moving? - Oh, it's not. - Seriously, it's moving. - What the hell's in there? - It's just my knitting. That's all. Yes, I knit this. I'm very good. Ross' apartment is nice. Why don't we hang out here? Maybe because it smells weird. It's like old pumpkins or something. - That's my pie. - Which smells delicious. - Uh-oh. Uh-oh. - What? We left Joey alone with the food. Yep, yep, I knew it. There he is... ...feeding stuffing to a dog! Hi, Geller-Bing residence. How can I help? Why is a dog in our apartment? I'm sorry, who's this? There's a dog sitting on my couch. Tell her I'm allergic, and I will sue! - There's no dog here. - There is! He's black and white and shaggy. <i>He's sitting next to Rachel</i> <i>and licking her hand. </i> Oh, my God! Where are you? I'll be right there. They're here already? How are they doing this?! Hi, Tag. What are you doing here? I wanted to see if your offer was still good. Well, sure. Come in. Well, what happened to your girlfriend? We kind of broke up this morning. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Yeah, so she went back to Ohio. Ohio, thank you. Where's the dog? What dog? There's no dog here. Yeah, that dog left. Phoebe. Phoebe, open up. There's no dog in here. Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking. No, that's just me coughing. Oh, good. There you are. Listen, I have a dog in my room. What is it doing here? I'm watching it for friends who left town. Wait. Hello, my name is Klunkers. May I please stay with you nice people? I wish he could stay, but Chandler's allergic. Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than five minutes... ...my throat will just close up. That's odd. This dog's been living here for the past three days. Really? If he's been here that long... ...without a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to it. It still has to go, right? Why? - Okay, it's... - Don't do it! - Don't do what? - I have to. Okay? It's time. Okay, I hate dogs. - What?! - That's crazy? Why? Told you. They are needy... ...jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking... ...and that scares me a little bit. You're right. They are scary. She just ate a treat out of my hand! Wait. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies? Is there a puppy here? - You don't like puppies? - Okay, you are new. Look, Chandler, I told you. Never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not liking ice cream. - You don't like ice cream? - It's too cold! It's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable. Hurts my teeth. And I don't want you guys to hate me... ...but I don't think I can be around that dog anymore, okay? So either the dog goes or I go. Oh, my God! How can I not get this? I'm a college professor. I got 1 450 on my SATs. Twelve fifty. Damn, I forgot you were here. We're gonna take Klunkers to Ross'. We'll be back soon. Can I ask you a question? When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend... ...what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before making a move? I'd say about a month. Really? I'd say three to four. Half-hour. Interesting. When it's your assistant, I'd say never. All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo point. A ""moo"" point? Yeah. It's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's ""moo. "" Have I been living with him for too long, or did that make sense? Don't listen to Joey. Okay, would you look at him? He's obviously depressed. He's away from his family. What he needs right now is for you to be his friend. You're right. I'm sorry. Thank you. - Okay, that's what I'm going to do. - Fine, take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside. How you holding up? Not bad. - I'm sorry about your girlfriend. - Thanks. - Were you guys together a long time? - A year, on and off. I thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore. - Now that she broke up with you. - Yeah. It's weird. I used to assume that I would meet someone and fall in love and be happy. That all that was just a given. Lately, it's like, what if it's not? Do you ever have that feeling? No. Yeah. All the time. Constantly. It's terrifying. But you know, then I figure it has to work out. Why? Because it has to. - You have all the answers, don't you? - No, no, I do. I really do. - Thanks for talking to me. - Come on, what are bosses for? Hug it out. All right, he likes you back. Told you you should go for it. What? Street noise drown any of that out? No? See you later. Okay. What did Joey say? I like you back? Joey knows that I'm very insecure about my back. And you were hugging me... ...so obviously you are not repulsed by it. Yeah! - Wait, that doesn't make any sense. - No? All right, here's the truth. Joey said what he said... ...because I'm attracted to you. Wow. Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you. I know that's crazy because we work together... ...and nothing could ever happen. The last thing I wanted to do was freak you out... ...or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be great if you said something right about now. Oh, my God. Those guys are stealing my car. What? Right there. That's my car! - Hey! - Okay, that'll take one minute. Do you have anything else to say? I can't believe it. We still have time to talk, and they're not even in the car yet. Look, there they go. Okay, Phoebe. We should probably go back now. Please, don't leave me. I'll be lonely. Stop it. Stop. - Okay, let's go. We can be strong. - Yeah, okay. Did you hear that? She said, ""Monica. "" I can't leave her. We could sneak the dog back and Chandler wouldn't even know. That won't work. I've had that dog for three days, and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart. Hey. I didn't know either. Yeah, but you kind of knew that something was going on, didn't you? Yeah, I knew. Where's Chandler? - Here I am. - Wash your hands. How did you know? Hey, what's she doing back here? Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream. Hey, look, Phoebe. I laid out the states geographically. We don't have time. We have to keep Chandler away. - Yeah, but, look what... - This is what we do not have time for! - Where's Monica? - In Phoebe's room. You can't go in. Why not? Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Klunkers thing. - Well, I should go in there. - No, no. No, she doesn't want to see you right now. - Why not? - Because you sent away the dog. - That's ridiculous. - Oh, is it? Is it?! Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And one day, my dad decides he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend, Phyllis... ...take away the dog and that was the last time we ever saw him. See? This is just like that... ...only with a few details changed. Okay, I'm in my sweatpants. Bring on the food. - What's the matter? - Monica's upset because of Klunkers. So? Bring the dog back. You're a hero. Yeah, I could be a hero. I could do that. What if it attacks me? Chandler, it's like a big gerbil. And that doesn't scare you? Ross, you need some help? From you? Yes, please. First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up. I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving. - Tag still talking to the police? - Yeah. Dammit. Why did I open my mouth? ""I have a crush on you. I'm attracted to you. "" I know that I freaked him out. If you said it like that, you did. Hey, is Chandler here? No, he went for a walk. Okay, you cannot tell him, but look who's back. Well, no, no, no. He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here. Oh, no, the dog's not going to be there! You think? Hi, honey. Please, please, please, don't be mad at me. - What? Why would...? - Wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't. Okay, I went over to Ross' to bring back Klunkers for you... ...and I left the door open, and she must've gotten out. And I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof. Which, FYI, Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him... ...and I am so, so, so sorry. But I do know where we can all go ease the pain. We have good news. Look who's back! Klunkers. Oh, my God! - She came back all by herself. - It's a Thanksgiving miracle. It is so good to see you. She came all the way back from Ross'. The things she must've seen. She climbed up the fire escape... ...and tapped on the window with her teeny paw, and we ran to let her in. I went too far, didn't I? When should I have stopped? Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something. I have 49 states... ...and there are no more! I think I should be able to eat something. It's up to you. - Oh, hi. How are you doing? - I'm okay. I got to go to the police station and look at mug shots. Thanks for having me over. Tag, you're going? We didn't even get a chance to talk. So where did you say you're from again? - Colorado. - What good are you? Look, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace. Okay. I never should've said what I said. It just doesn't matter how I feel. We work together, so nothing could ever happen between us. I would love to go to work on Monday and never talk about this again. Okay. Big day, Monday. Lots to do. So we okay? I'm not. I freaked you out. No, you didn't. What freaked me out was you saying nothing could happen between us. - Really? - Yeah. So please don't fire me for doing this. That's one less thing we have to do on Monday. Delaware. Delaware. - All right. - I want my turkey now. You got it. You got Nevada twice. - I know. - Yeah. <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"
709,"- I'm ready. - You sure? Let me just straighten out your helmet there. - Thanks, Daddy. - No, no. One daddy, two mommies. - All right, it's all yours. - Okay, okay. There you go, there you go. Wow, Ben's first big kid's bike. This is so exciting! Oh, yeah, I remember mine. It was my sixth birthday. I went to the park... ...and I got on it and it bent. - Yeah. - I never had a bike of my own. - What? We didn't have a lot of money. But the girl across the street had the best bike. It was pink and it had rainbow-colored tassels hanging off the handles... ...and a bell and this big, white wicker basket... ...with those plastic daisies stuck on. That sounds like my first bike. My dad gave me his old one. - Did the girl ever let you ride it? - No. But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the bike on the front. So I would sit on it and my stepdad would drag me around the backyard. That is so unfair. Not really, I got to drag him around too. The One With All the Candy English Subtitles by SDI Media Group Hey, what are you guys doing? Making candy for the neighbors. I'm sorry, who? I'm gonna hang a basket on the door.

See, this is exactly why I'm making this candy. We can get to know our neighbors. Wouldn't it be easier if we just moved? Good morning! - Somebody's in a good mood. - Well, why shouldn't I be?

Wait, wait. Did you see that? He had no idea there was something going on between us. - I'd better get back to my desk. - Okay, hard worker. I'll put that in your evaluation. - My what? - You've been here for two months now. And your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation. But you know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate. - Are you serious? - No, but I've always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up? The basket is totally empty! The neighbors ate it all! Well, either that or... . Joey! Yeah? - Did you eat all the neighbor candy? - That was the plan. When I got to it, there was only a few pieces left. They've come by all day. They love it. They love my candy? - Oh, man, I gotta go make more. - Hey, Mon. Make some more lasagna too. Something might have happened to a chunk of it. Ross, the neighbors ate all my candy. Mine stole my newspaper. It's like a crime wave. Pheebs, you got a second? Sure. Ever since you told me about that bike... ...I couldn't stop thinking about it. I mean, everyone should have a first bike, you know? So... . Oh, my God, Ross! - You like it? - I love it! - Yeah? - Oh, oh, God... And I love you. Not that way. But the bike got you a lot closer. Well, take it downstairs. You know, give it a test drive. Okay. Oh, my God. My first bike! Thank you for the best present I've ever gotten. You're welcome. Oh, and Chandler's about to cry. Am not. Who is that? Don't worry, I'm brave. l... I am brave. No, no, no, no! Can you tell me who is there, please? My name's Gary. I live upstairs. - Hi. - Hi. - Do you know what time it is? - It's candy time. My roommate says they taste like little drops of heaven. Oh, please. Did you hear that? ""Little drops of heaven. "" Four a.m. So can I get some candy? I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work. He does not know that I am not ""some of us. "" I'm sorry, but I'll put some out in the morning. Okay, I'll swing by later. You live in this building? Seems like I'd remember you. Night, Gar. So did you read your evaluation yet? No, it was marked ""confidential. "" I just sent it to human resources. Please, you're kidding, right? I wrote that one as a joke for you. A joke they would appreciate? I'm thinking, no. - What did you say? - I said you were a good kisser... ...and that I liked your teeny, tiny tushy. No, not my tushy. It gets worse. About your initiative, I wrote: ""He was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision. "" Under problems with performance, I wrote, ""Dear God, I hope not. "" And then... And then I drew a little smiley face. And then a small pornographic sketch. That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike. When I heard the story, I almost cried. Almost cried, huh? Hear that, Chandler? ""Almost"" cried. Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about <i>Titanic. </i> Those two had only each other. She really likes it, huh? Oh, yeah. I saw her walking it down the street. She had these flowers in the basket. It was so cute. I saw her this morning, walking it by the park. Wait, she was walking the bike? Both times? - Hey, Pheebs. - Oh, hi! - Hey, so you enjoying the bike? - Oh, uh-huh, so much. Pheebs, you do know how to ride a bike, don't you? Of course. Can we see you ride it? Okay. See? I told you not to get involved with your assistant. There's no such thing as a secret when it comes to affairs. Did you hear that, Chandler? No such thing. What happened? I'm just eating candy. Maybe it's not that bad. They might not take it the way I meant it. Absolutely, you know? Because ""tushy"" can mean both ass... ...and good worker. I just gotta get the thing back. Rach? That sketch you mentioned? Might it have looked a little like this? Oh, my God, Joey! - What is the matter with you? - God! This little talent came in handy before I could afford porn. Hi, I'm sorry. I know it's after hours, but I really need candy. I'm sorry, I can't help you. See? Rules are rules. Please, I have people coming from out of town today. - I told them all about your candy. - You're kidding. Out-of-towners, huh? What did you tell them? I told them your candy was absolutely indescribable. Some people have said it's ""little drops of heaven. "" But whatever. - Please, can't you help me out? - Hey, Chandler, do we know that lady? Isn't she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud? All right, I'll do it just this once. - But you can't tell anyone. - Please, just give it to me. Yeah, that's her. - Thank you. - Unbelievable! I can't believe that sign didn't work. You know what would work? Stop making candy. But they like it. You mean they like you. Maybe. Is that why you became a chef, so people would like you? You want to talk about getting people to like you, huh, funny man? Just remember everything I taught you and you'll be fine. Okay? Here we go. Ready, set... Wait, this seat is really uncomfortable. Maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps like an airplane seat, or a beanbag chair! You can't get out of this. You have to learn how to ride a bike. Why? Why do I have to learn? - Well, in case of an emergency. - What kind of emergency? Well, what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says: ""You ride this bike or I'll... I'll shoot you. "" I would ring the bell to distract him. Then I would knock the gun away with a Chinese throwing star. Okay, Phoebe, just get on the bike... ...and, hey, I'll hold you up and push you. Okay? You won't let go? - No. - You swear? I swear. - Okay. - Come on. Here we go. All right? All right? Feel good? All right, try pedaling. That's it, you're doing great. Yes, take control. Yes, yes, yes! Oh, no! You swore! - I just thought you were doing so well. - I am shocked. Shocked! It's a legitimate learning technique. Wow. Hey, there's some people outside asking about candy. They'll just have to wait, okay? I only got two hands! - Need some help? - No, you don't know the system. I don't need nobody messing with the system! By the way, the week before your wedding, you may not see a lot of me. Oh, hello, liar. Look, I'm really sorry I let go of the bike. I could've been killed, you know. I know, I know. But can we please try it again? I mean, you were so close, Phoebe. Well, I would love to... ...but the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects. - Phoebe. - What? What the hell? You know what? If you won't learn how to ride, then I'm sorry... ...I have to take it back. - But why? Because it's... . It'd be like you having this guitar... ...and never playing it. Okay, this guitar wants to be played. And this bike wants to be ridden. And if you don't ride it... ...you're killing its spirit. The bike... ...is dying. All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay. Great. You're making the bike very happy. Okay, Ross. Please don't die! To get the evaluation before they see it... ...we gotta get into Zelner's office. He doesn't get in until 10. But his assistant, Betty, comes in early to eat breakfast at her desk. - That's kind of sad. - Yeah, well, Betty's kind of sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates. While I distract her, you go in. - Got it. - Let's roll. Hello, Rachel. You got a minute? Yeah, sure, Mr. Zelner. For you? Anything. Minute. Okay, great. Abort the plan. Actually, I'd like to speak to both of you. Okay. Well, can we get you anything, Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates. No, thanks, but I'll give these to Betty. So, I read your evaluation of Tag. Or, to use his full name, Tag ""Sweet Cheeks"" Jones? Is something going on with you two? Oh, my God, can you imagine if there was? I mean, what would happen exactly? Well, I'd be forced to file a report. I'd have to consult with the legal department. And your future at the company would be in jeopardy. - Well... - Mr. Zelner... . I filled in that evaluation. - Oh, no... - Yeah, yeah. I thought it would be funny. You wrote that you have a cute tushy? Yes. I have a weird sense of humor. And I'm kind of strangely proud of my butt. It's kind of a risky joke, Tag. What is this drawing? I can't figure it out. It's upside down, you gotta... It doesn't matter. It's not like I don't have a sense of humor. Hell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick every now and then. There's a time and a place. Unless you have a limerick right now. No? Okay. Well, you've got my fax number. I can't believe you did that. That was sweet. - Don't worry about it. - You could've lost your job. Are you kidding me? With this cute butt, I'd find work. Thank you, you're great. - You know what? - What? I feel great. In fact... . What? It's just... It took me so long to get that desk organized. I'm sorry. There it is. What is going on? We're waiting for the candy. Bring out the candy! Yeah, lady, give us candy. Joey! - What's up, buddy? - What are you doing? Waiting to get candy. Get in here. Hey, and you cannot smoke in here. Merry Christmas. The candy is coming! I need another 15 minutes for it to cool. All right, everybody, just be quiet. Be quiet! Be quiet! Pipe down! What is the matter with you people? This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could get to know all of you... ...and I'll bet that not one of you can tell me her name. Am I right? Candy Lady? No, not ""Candy Lady. "" If we know it, can we have candy? All right, you know what? Forget it, you've ruined it. Go home. You've ruined it. That's all wrong! You guys ruined everything. You ruined it! - Thank you. - You're welcome. Did you smoke? No, smokes-a-lot lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Are you okay? Fine, but it was really scary for a while. Someone slipped a threatening note under the door! Oh, yeah. Sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever. I can't believe it. I did it. I rode a bike! I never thought I'd be able to do that. Thank you. Oh, hey, don't thank me. Thank yourself. You're the one who faced your fears and ultimately overcame them. Don't be so corny, Ross. It's not an After School Special. <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"
710,"Bye-bye. I just got reservations at Michelle's... ...and tickets to <i>The Music Man</i> to celebrate... ...our first holiday as a betrothed couple. - ""Betrothed. "" - Betrothed couple. Pheebs? Skull? Yeah, it's my mom's. Oh, my God! No, no, no. It's not my mom. It belonged to my mom. She used to put it out every Christmas... ...to remind us that even though it's Christmas, people still die. And you can put candy in it. Licorice? Sure. - I get Ben for the holidays this year. - That's great! - Are you gonna dress up as Santa? - Nope. I know Susan does every year. I want to take this year to teach him about Hanukkah. And maybe I could teach Ben... ...about the Christmas skull and how people die. You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe. - Did you know he was in there? - No. - How long have we been home? - About half an hour. Lovely. The One With The Holiday Armadillo English Subtitles by SDI Media Group You know what I was thinking? When we get married, will you... ...change your name to ""Bing""? No. Why not? Bing's weird. Oh, hey, you guys. My landlord just called. My apartment's gonna be ready soon. I guess I'll be moving out. Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you. Yes, you will be very sad. - I gotta go tell Rachel the good news. - You'll be living together again? - Why not? - She's having so much fun with Joey... ...I assumed she'd still be living with him. Why do you think she's having so much fun? No reason, except she... ...told me. She said she didn't want to live with me? No. No, she didn't say that. I think you should talk to Monica now. Phoebe, I'm sure she wants to live with you. You're absolutely sure? No, but I'll bet she probably does. Oh, probably? I don't like that word. I know what ""probably"" really means. Yeah, yeah. ""Oh, your mom probably won't kill herself. "" I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging my hopes... ...of Rachel and I living together on ""probably. "" You gotta take care of yourself in this world. History teaches us nothing. Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it? You're home. Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas? - Drums? - No, drums! Could we get two burritos to go, please? I'm sorry. But not that sorry, you don't have to live with it. We have a reservation under Bing. Okay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes. We have tickets to <i>The Music Man</i> at 8. I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir. Is this because of the burrito thing? - You need to give him money. - It was a joke! To get a table. Places like this are always shaking you down. - Everybody wants a payoff. - All right, calm down, O'Malley. - I'll slip him some money. - But you've got to be smooth. Hey, I can be smooth. We're in a hurry. If you could get us a table... ...a bit quicker, I'd appreciate it. - Of course, sir. - Okay. - How'd it go? - Had the money in the wrong hand. You don't feel... ...like you're gonna throw up? - No. Well, I do. So let's... . So, Ben, you... . You know what holiday is coming up? Christmas. Yeah, and you know what other holiday is coming up? Christmas Eve. Yes, but also... . Hanukkah! See, you're part Jewish and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday. Santa has reindeers that can fly. Right, but on Hanukkah... Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees. Okay, that's right. Yes... ...but on Hanukkah, we sing: Okay, it's not a contest. When is Santa coming? How about this year, instead of Santa... ...we have fun celebrating Hanukkah? No Santa? Was I bad? No, no, no, you weren't bad. You've been very good, Ben. - Santa's mad at me. - No, hey, hey, come on. Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay? You're his favorite little guy. So Santa's coming? Yes! Santa's coming. It's easy. Just keep it casual. Shake his hand and give him the money. - How do you know so much about this? - I don't know. Richard used to do it, didn't he? We'd be eating our soup right now. Mustached bastard. Those people just left. Come on. Quick, give him the money. Excuse me. So you like the drums. That's great. I was worried that they would create maybe... ...an unbearable living situation. But, okay, well, apparently not. So, yay! Hey, we already learned a song. Ready? One, two, three, four. Tequila! That's fun. Here you go. Thank you, Gunther. Put her there. Definitely not easier with coins. - Thank you. - Thank you. Hey, Pheebs. Here. Now I only owe you $49.50. Hey, Pheebs... ...if you want to get Joey a gift that disrupts the entire building... ...why not something more subtle... ...like a wrecking ball... ...or a vial of small pox to release in the hallway? It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes... ...Joey throws his sticks in the air... ...and I have to hear: ""Oh, my eye! Oh, God, my eye! "" - I mean, it's so annoying. - Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums. You got Joey drums to annoy Rachel... ...so she wouldn't want to live there anymore? Maybe on some level. You could just not throw the sticks up in the air. What is rock 'n' roll about that? Hey, Joey, I got you another present. Hold it! Before you tell me what it is... . Okay, what is it? It's a... ...tarantula! God, Rachel, I'm sorry. What was I thinking... ...giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider... ...in such a poorly constructed cage? What are you talking about? I love them. I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it died because my cat ate it. And then my cat died. But, Joey, isn't this cool? Is it on me? I feel like it's on me. I got... Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula. He's so adorable. He's so much fun. I'm glad you're having so much fun here. Wait a minute. What's the matter? Our apartment is ready. And that makes you angry because...? Because you'd rather live here with Joey. - Where did you get that? - Monica and Chandler... ...said you were having so much fun here... ...and apparently no amount of drums or tarantula is gonna change that. Did you get all this stuff for Joey... ...to try to drive me out of the apartment? You might as well have gotten him a fish. You know how fish freak me out. Fish. But it wouldn't have mattered. We're gonna live together. That's the deal. Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me. But if you're having so much fun over here... It's so much more fun with you. - We did have fun, didn't we? - We did. They say, if we want, we could see it tonight. - I would love to. - Yay, okay! - Good, good, good. - Great. All right. Good. And Monica asked me to make the drumming stop. Done. Hello, sir. You here to return those pants? No, these are my pants. Okay. - How can I help you? - Do you have a Santa outfit left? Two days before Christmas? Sorry, man. Okay, look. Do you have anything Christmas-y? I promised my son, and I really don't want to disappoint him. Come on, you gotta have something. I'm the Holiday Armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's... ...and he sent me here to wish you... ...a merry Christmas! What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo? Santa was unavailable... ...so close to Christmas. Come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted, coming all the way from Texas. - Texas? - That's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative... ...for all the Southern states. And Mexico! But Santa sent me here... ...to give you these presents, Ben. Maybe the lady will help me with these presents. Wow, thanks! You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas. And happy Hanukkah! Are you for Hanukkah too? Because I'm part Jewish. You are? Me too. Because armadillos also wandered in the desert? You want to wander in the hall? Hey, Ben! What if the Holiday Armadillo... ...told you all about the Festival of Lights? Cool! Come on, Ben. Years and years ago... ...there were these people called... ...the Maccabees! - Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas! Santa! What are you doing here, Santa? Well, I'm here to see my old buddy, Ben. What are you doing here... ...Weird Turtle Man? I'm the Holiday Armadillo... ...your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember? What? Did you bring me any presents, Santa? You bet I did, Ben. Put her there. Well, it would have worked this time if his hands weren't so damn small. Ho, ho, ho! Ben, come open more gifts. The armadillo and I will have a talk in the kitchen. There's a sentence I never thought I'd say. What are you doing? You said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume... ...so I borrowed one from a guy at work. Thank you, but you gotta leave. - Why? - Because... ...I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah... ...and you're wrecking it. But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowlful of jelly. I'm sorry, Chandler, but this is really important to me. Fine, I'll give the suit back. Hey, you think you can keep it another night? Santa, really? Yeah, is that okay? Did your dad ever dress up like Santa? - No. - Then it's okay! Okay, Ben. Santa has to go. Say goodbye. No, why does he have to go? Because if Santa and the Holiday... ...Armadillo... ...are ever in the same room for too long... ...the universe will implode! Merry Christmas! No, why can't the armadillo leave? I want Santa. Fine, I give up. Santa... Santa can stay! Well, I'll stay... ...but only because I want to hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa... ...and learn about Hanukkah? Okay, Santa. - Thank you. - You're welcome. All right, it's time... ...for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago... ...there were these people called the Maccabees! Merry Christmas! Oh, wow, look at this place! Oh, this is terrible. They've made so many changes... ...I can't even feel my grandmother's presence anymore. Oh, new sconces! - Oh, my God! - What? Remember how you told me your grandmother put up that wall... ...to make that into two bedrooms? - Yeah. And that the landlord might find out... ...and then tear it down? - Yeah? Do you really not know where I'm going? It left. It's one huge room. Oh, no! Wow! See? I guess we'll have to put the wall back up. - You can't, with the new skylight. - There's a skylight? Wow! So should we start looking for a new place? You know, I'm sensing... ...that my grandmother would not be comfortable with that. Oh, yeah? Starting to feel her again there, are we? - A little bit. Yeah. - Yeah. Is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone? You heard it too? You have the gift. Phoebe, it's okay. I like living with Joey. - Are you sure? - Please. I hate packing... ...it's closer to work. And we do have fun. Although, I'm really gonna miss living with you. - Oh, me too. - I know. Did you hear that? I'm getting something from your grandmother. She said since you get to keep the one-bedroom apartment... ...you should give Rachel the purple chair. No, I do not hear that. And the miracle was that that little bit of oil... ...that should have lasted just one day, burned for... . - Eight whole days. - That's right. And that's why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end. - Awesome. - Yeah. My favorite part... ...was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt. The armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part. Okay, Ben, it's time to light... ...the Hanukkah candles! Wow! Looks like the Easter Bunny's funeral in here. Come on, come on. We're lighting the candles. I understand why Superman is here... ...but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny's funeral? - You get it? - I got it. Back in the cage? It's back in the cage. Is the cage closed? Joey, will you just come out here and stop being such a baby! <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"

It was at the front door when I got home. Somebody sent it to us. This isn't addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs! Thief! I didn't read the box before I opened it... ...and you can't return a box after you opened it! - Why not? - Because it's too delicious! You stole this cheesecake. That's wrong. No, it'll be okay because Mrs. Braverman will send for a free one. That way, we all win. The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate... ...""Mama's Little Bakery. "" I feel terrible.

Today they do a test on me and it turns out I'm not brain-dead. So... Mr. Smarty Pants. It's just my character that's not brain-dead. Pheebs, still on for tonight? - Absolutely. - I'll see you at 8. What's at 8? Dinner. We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you. Wow! Did not know that. May I say how lovely you look today? Duly noted. So for tomorrow, do you want to rent a car and drive down together? - What are you talking about? - Cousin Frannie's wedding. You were invited? No. Oh, my God, I can't believe this. I thought only Mom and Dad were invited. From the ages of 7 to 9, Frannie and I were inseparable. Maybe since the age of 9, Frannie's made some new friends. It's probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Cheryl. Maybe you are invited and the invitation got lost in the mail. You call her and tell her that when we were kids... ...her precious Frannie tried to undress me several times. If I hadn't stopped her, there wouldn't be a wedding to go to. She tried to undress me too. I used to undress my cousin Glenn. Joseph Francis Tribbiani, are you home yet? I think he's still out. What's wrong? I'll tell you, Rachel Karen Greene. I had plans with Joey, and he left me this note. ""Pheebs, can't make it. Got a date. Talk to you later. Big Daddy. "" - ""Big Daddy""? - That's a nickname we were trying. You know what nickname never caught on? ""The Ross-a-tron. "" Here's Joseph Francis! Wait, what are you middle-naming me for? I left you a note. That doesn't give you the right to ditch me! You can cancel plans with friends if there's a possibility for sex. He's right. That is the rule. I don't accept it. When we make plans, I expect you to show up. I'm not a way to kill time till you meet someone better. Boyfriends and girlfriends will come and go, but this is for life. I'm so sorry. I had no idea it would bother you this much. Well, it does. Well, can I make it up to you? I'm sorry. How about dinner tomorrow night? I'll pay for myself. Okay, you wore me down. While you're over there, how about a beer for ""The Ross-a-tron""? ""Ross..."" Is that back? The other cheesecake came. They delivered it here again. Just bring it downstairs. What's the problem? I can't seem to say goodbye. Are you serious? We ate an entire cake two days ago and you want more? Well, I've forgotten what it tastes like. It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust... ...with a very rich... ...yet light cream cheese filling. Wow, my whole mouth just filled with saliva. Know what? Forget it. We're just hungry. We haven't had lunch. We're just lightheaded. So let's go have lunch and forget about the cheesecake. We'll drop it off so we're not tempted. - Where do you want to eat? - Mama's Little Bakery, Chicago. Mel Torm died. Joey, that paper's like a year old. Does that mean the Sam Goody's sale is over? So, I finally heard back from Aunt Cheryl... ...and apparently it wasn't a mistake. There's limited seating... Limited seating? I am just one tiny person! Yeah, but she doesn't know that. I mean, the last time she saw you... ...you'd have turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling. ""Limited seating. "" That's such a lame excuse. That's not the reason she's not inviting me. What's the big deal? I wasn't invited to the ceremony, just the reception. If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I will just make an appearance... ...and then we'll leave early as a sign of protest. - Joan? - Yeah, my date. Assistant professor in linguistics. Tall, very beautiful. And despite what some people say, not broad-backed. Wait a minute. You got ""Ross Geller and Guest""? I wasn't invited, and you got ""and Guest""? Excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross' behalf. I think the rule applies here. Since he has a chance to get on broad-back... Not broad-back! Wait a minute. You're bringing me. I can't cancel on Joan. - Why not? - Did you not hear me? She's an assistant professor in the linguistics department. They're wild. - Why do you want to come anyway? - Because... ...she's my cousin. I mean, we grew up together. Family, you know? And all that's important to me. Okay, all right. I'll take you. I'll go call Joan. Oh, that's nice. Family should be there. It's her wedding. Happiest day of her life. We'll see. Well, thank you for lunch. Wait, I thought you paid. Apparently, we don't pay for food anymore. - Do you see what I see? - It's still there. Mrs. Braverman must be out. She could be out of town. Maybe gone for months. By then, it may spoil. She can't come back to bad cheesecake. - It could kill her. - Don't want that. We're protecting her. - We'll take it. - But quick. - Why? - I hear her in there. Go! Go! Go! Oh, my God, that's David. - Who? - David, the scientist guy. David that I was in love with. Who went to Russia and broke my heart, David. Oh, my God! Say their name enough, they turn around. Phoebe. David. What are you doing? Aren't you supposed to be in Russia? I'm just in town for a conference. God, you look phenomenal. Well... . Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut? Yeah. Well, I got like 30 of them. Look, I got a confession to make. I was hoping to run into you here. I didn't know if I should call. I was only in town a few days... ...and I didn't want to intrude on your life. I really wanted to see you... ...but I didn't know if you wanted to see me. Of course I would want to see you. I think about you all the time. Really? Because I think about you all the time. There's a statue in Minsk that reminds me of you so much. It's actually of Lenin... ...but, you know, at certain angles... . Anyway, do you want to have dinner tonight? Yes. Oh, no! - What? - I can't. I can't believe I have plans. Can you do it tomorrow? No, I have to go in a few hours. I have to be on the redeye. Listen, next time you're in Minsk... . Phoebe? Can I talk to you for a second? What are you doing? I have plans with Joey. So? He'll understand. No, he won't. And that's not even the point. I made a whole speech about how you do not cancel plans with friends. And now just because, potentially, the love of my life... ...returns from Russia for one night... ...I should change my beliefs? I should change my beliefs! No. If I don't have my principles, I don't have anything. You're so strong. Or I should rush through dinner with Joey and meet David at 9. Oh, my God, that is so good! I'm full. And yet I know if I stop eating this... ...I'll regret it. Hey, what have you got there? Oh, it's... . It's tofu cake. Want some? What are you doing tonight? Dude. Dude. Sorry. I got plans with Phoebe. Really? Monica said she had a date at 9. - What? Tonight? - That's what Monica said. After that speech, she makes a date on the same night she has plans with me? She's trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy. Here, I think this is us. Limited seating, my ass. Let's see who made the cut. Hi. I'm Monica Geller. - How do you know the bride and groom? - I worked with Frannie. Used to work with her. Used to. I'm a relative and I didn't get invited. A blood relative. Blood. Stop saying ""blood"" to strangers. And you? How do you know the couple? We went to college with both of them. Now we live next door. Okay, you're fine. - Are you guys ready? - Yes. I'll have a green salad, house dressing and water's fine. And for you, sir? Yeah. This slow-roasted salmon... ...how slow are we talking? It's already been roasted. Oh, then no. Maybe I should hear the specials again. We've heard the specials three times. There's prime rib, mahi-mahi and a very special lobster ravioli. - Actually, we're out of the ravioli. - Well, that changes everything! You know what, Pheebs? You were right before. Friends are so important. Yeah, I'm very wise. I know. Know what I really want? - What? - Is to have a long, long talk. You know? Get Joey out on the open road and really open him up. - Any progress? - Yes. I will have the lobster ravioli. God, Joey, this is taking forever. - What's the rush? - Well... ...I have an appointment. And it's very important. What is it? Well... ...it's a date. A date? No, you must be mistaken, because you wouldn't have a date... ...on the same night you have plans with a friend. Don't make me feel badly. No, I'm gonna! You made me feel really guilty about going out with that girl. Like I did something terrible. Now you're doing the same thing. It's not! It's totally different! This is with David. Remember David, the scientist guy? He's very special to me. My girl the other night was special. She was a scientist too. - She was? - Well, she graduated high school. Whatever. Know what? He's only here for four hours and I'm gonna go see him. - Fine! - Yeah. What are you still doing here? I told you, lobster ravioli! I was about to leave. I didn't think you were coming. I wouldn't have missed this. Well, I'm very glad you're here. Oh, you're such a gentleman. Come on, we're going to my place. Are you eating the cheesecake without me? I will give you $ 100 to whistle right now. - How can you eat it without me? - What'll you do? Tell Monica or Joey? No, you'd have to tell them everything. We're dessert stealers. We're living outside the law. I don't trust you with this cake. I got it first, and I'm taking it back! - What? Oh, no. - Oh, yes. You think I trust you with it? No, we'll split it. That's not fair. You had some. I think Monica would be very interested to know... ...that you called her cheesecake ""dry and mealy. "" What do we use to split it? All right, pick a half. Well, this side looks bigger. But there's more crust on this side. Maybe if I measure it... Pick a piece! - All right, I pick that one. - It's the smaller piece. Okay. There you go. Enjoy your half, my friend. But that is it. No sharing, no switching, and don't come crying to me... ...if you eat your piece too fast. - You gonna give me some of yours? - Oh, no. No switching, no sharing. And don't come crying to me. I may just sit here and have my cake all day. Just sit here in the hallway and eat my... Ross, sweetheart! Oh, hey, Aunt Millie. - Isn't it a beautiful wedding? - Yes, it is. Every time, on the lips! Why? Why on the lips? There's Frannie. Won't she be happy to see me? You be nice, all right? I didn't bring you to ambush her. Frannie was the one who showed your <i>Playboys</i> to Mom. That bitch. Monica! What...? Am I doing here? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that? Hi, Frannie. Congratulations. You invite my whole family, and not me? Why? Why wouldn't you want me here? What could I have done? Stuart! I believe you know my husband. So it's really a question of ""who"" could you have done. I hate this, but I have to go. I can't miss my flight. I bet there's another flight to Minsk in... July. That's really beautiful. What does it mean? ""Please clean my beakers. "" I don't get out of the lab much. I thought it meant something else. Yeah, well, I really actually wanted to say... ...that. But I figured I probably shouldn't because... ...I have to leave. No, you're right. Don't say it. I do, though. I do too. Well, bye, Phoebe. Now's not the time, Joey. You can yell at me tomorrow. Wait, no, Pheebs. I'm not gonna yell at you. I just started thinking about you and David... ...and I remember how bummed you were the first time he left. Oh, Pheebs, come here. - Are you okay? - No, I'm not okay. The only guy I've ever been crazy about is going to Minsk... ...and I may never see him again. You could always visit him. Right. Like they'll let me have a passport. Anything I can do? Whatever you need. Well, now... ...if you achieve distillation of subatomic particles before he does... ...then he could come back. I could give it a shot. Oh, look! There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it. - Stick to your side! - Come on, now! All right, what are we having? Oh, wait, I forgot my wrap. Okay, wait here. Hi, sweetie! Are you leaving? - Well... - Give us a kiss. Come on. Why? Why on the lips? <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"
712,"Ross, when's this comet thing start? Well, technically, it started 7 billion years ago. Okay. Fine, I'll stop. No teaching, okay? We'll just watch the pretty light streaking across the sky. Okay? Whose official name is Bapstein-King. Okay! Okay! There it is. Oh, look at that! Isn't Mother Nature amazing? That's a plane. Well, all right, 1 700 bags of peanuts flying that high... ...that's pretty amazing too. - I wonder if you can see my apartment. - No, you can't. - What? - I don't know. Man, look at all those stars. Infinite space. It really makes you wonder, doesn't it? - Know what else makes you wonder? - What? Check out the rack on that chick. The One Where They're Up All Night English Subtitles by SDI Media Group We've been out here for two hours... ...and we haven't seen any stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, Chandler's getting chilly. No, I'm not. Then why are you wearing Monica's jacket? Because it's flattering! Come on, Monica. Come on, Monica. - We're going too. We got a movie. - I won't say no to a movie. Oh, Pheebs, we just actually wanted to be alone. - Sh. Get me out of here. - Oh, okay. - Hey, Ross. - What? - Check it out. - Is it the comet? No. Look, there's a bug stuck in tar right here. I can't believe... I bring you to see the Bapstein-King comet... ...one of nature's most spectacular phenomena... ...and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and some woman. You know, there's two women, dude. Show me where. Okay. Right up here. Joey, where's the pipe that was holding the door open? I don't know. Yeah, I do. - Joey! - What? Hey, don't look at me! You wanted to come up here and look for some stupid Burger King comet. It's called the Bapstein-King comet, okay? Hey, Bapstein was a very well-respected astronomer from... No! - Monica. - She's sleeping. I know. Just a quick question. Which one was <i>Deep Impact</i> and which one was <i>Armageddon</i>? <i>Deep Impact</i> was the one with Robert Duvall. <i>Armageddon</i> is what's going to happen to you if you wake me up. Sorry, I just can't sleep. Where's that book you're reading with two women who are ice-skating... ...and wearing those hats with the flowers on it. Because every time I look at that cover, I'm like... It's in the living room, where there's also a light... ...and no one will kick you in the shin. What? Please don't be a spaceship. Please don't be a spaceship. Oh, thank God. How could you be beeping? I just disconnected you! I took out your battery! How can...? Don't interrupt me! Monica! Monica! Come on! I can't believe this! All right, well, I guess we know what we have to do to get down. Yeah, I guess we don't have a choice. Help us! Please, help us! We're stuck up on the roof, and we can't get down! Ross. I was thinking we'd just go down the fire escape. I know. I wasn't finished. But don't worry! We're gonna go down the fire escape! Sh! I'm sorry, I thought I'd make some warm milk and it would help me sleep. With a wok? My boring book didn't put you to sleep? It got interesting. Damn you, Oprah! Here, let me make the milk. I'm up anyway. You know what we could do now that we're up? We could just talk to each other all night long. Like when we were first dating. It'd be fun. - Okay, that does sound fun. - Yeah. So how bummed were you when the second sister died, huh? The second sister dies?! No. No, I was talking about the book I was reading. The second sister dies in <i>Archie and Jughead Double Digest</i>? That's correct. Want to go in the bedroom? It's more comfortable. - Sure. - Okay. Oh, wait, did you send those contracts to Milan? If this is your idea of sexy talk... . Did you overnight the contracts I gave you? What contracts? Please tell me this is just one of your jokes that I don't get. Like what? Like the thing when you put the phone in your pants? Tag, I'm serious. This isn't funny. Those contracts had to go out today. You didn't give me any contracts. Yes, I did. I put a little Post-it on it that said: ""Must go out today,"" and I underlined ""today"" three times. Then I put a little heart in the corner so I wouldn't seem too bossy. You never gave them to me. If we went to the office, you would see those contracts sitting on your desk. No, I'd see you looking embarrassed because they are not on my desk. Maybe I'm embarrassed because you talk on the phone with your crotch. You want to go to the office now? Come on, it's late. We're not going down to the office. Yeah, I understand. I wouldn't want to be proved wrong either. All right, get your coat! Oh! When did you unhook this? Nice work! It won't go down any further. It's stuck. We'll just have to jump. Now, we're gonna have to make sure to land... ...to the right of that patch of ice, okay? Not hit the dumpster on the other side. And try to avoid that weird brownish-red stuff in the middle. So when you get down there... ...you go up to the roof and you let me in. - Wait a minute. I have to do it? - You'll be fine. It'll be just like bungee jumping, you know? But instead of bouncing back up, you won't. Well, what if I smack my head on the concrete? Well, I'm not gonna lie to you, Joey. It's a possibility. I don't know. Tell you what, let's flip to see who does it. - You call it in the air, all right? - Oh, all right. - Can you see what it is? - No. - Okay. Well, you be careful. - No, Ross, stop it. I'm not jumping. Look, I have an audition tomorrow, and I can't go if I break my leg. Well, I'm not jumping. I have a son. He won't have a father if I die. So it looks like we're even. Okay, so this wire... ...is connected to this wire, which plugs into here. Okay, so to get the beeping to stop, all I have to do... . Okay. Well done, Pheebs. What do you want from me?! Here's your milk. What should we talk about? What? What? What? Oh, were you sleeping, sweetie? I'm sorry. Here. Okay. Feel free to look... ...but I'm telling you those contracts are not here. How could you know? Look at this mess, Tag. This is what I'm saying. You have to be more organized. You've got newspapers, you've got magazines, you... Oh! And who's this chippy? A little young for you, but whatever. That's my sister. Really? Very cute braces. Anyway, you know what? The point is, Tag, start looking... ...because you're gonna find those contracts on your desk. So when do you imagine you gave them to me? Morning or afternoon? In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch... ...he put them on my desk, and then I put a Post-it on it... ...that said: ""Must go out today. "" So you just keep looking in there, all right? They're not here. Puzzler. Bit of a puzzle. Why don't you check the copy room? Maybe the contracts are in there. - How could I have left them there? - I don't know. How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? It's not a perfect world. Just go, please? - Fine. - Thank you. Hello? I still don't get it. You still awake? Yeah. You? You do know that was me that just said that, right? Hey. As long as we're both up... . Yeah? I hope you're not thinking about cleaning the living room. Man, I'm starving. What the hell was I thinking at dinner? ""Do you want soup or salad?"" Both, always order both. You know, I'm looking, and I don't think anyone's home here. I say we just break the window... ...crawl through... ...and you know, explain later. - No one's home? - I don't think so. Hello? So when you get in there... . Okay. This is where you and I part ways. Noisy bitch! Oh, what? What are you doing? Do you know what just happened? Yeah. We had sex and then we fell asleep. No. We were in the middle of sex... ...and you fell asleep. No. No, that's not true. No, best time ever. Yeah. You rock my world. - Monica? - What? I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right. Okay. Okay. I'm ready. - Come on, big fella. - Okay. - Give me the good stuff. - Yeah. No, no, no. Don't fall asleep. Okay, I'm going to make you some coffee. Well, I probably won't spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor. Okay, I'm up. I'm up. Hi. I got you some coffee to... So you got anything for me? - Still no luck. - Oh, my God. You checked your entire desk and all the drawers? - Want me to check again? - I wish you would. Well, no, it's not in there. How about that drawer? Well, it's not out here. Any chance it could be in your office? I don't know. I mean, let me check. Any luck? See you in my office for a minute? You found them! I'm not even gonna gloat. - I'm just really relieved it's... - You put these on my desk. - I did not. - Oh, really? So they left your bottom drawer... ...crawled across the floor, then jumped onto my desk? How did you know they were in my bottom drawer? I am so hot for you right now. Oh, my God! How did you get back here? Phoebe Buffay? Fire Alarm? Oh, hi, Officer Fireman. Can I help you? Your fire alarm was in the trash. - That's not mine. - Yes, it is. How do you know? If you dump a fire alarm, don't use a blanket that says: ""Property of Phoebe Buffay, not Monica. "" Do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked, this was still America. Please reattach it. It's illegal to disconnect them. Fine. But please, God, tell me how to stop it from going off? Press the reset button. There's a reset button? Oh, thank you. Thank you. Oh. There's a reset button? My God! Why didn't I see that? Reset button. Reset button. Where is there a reset button? Oh, here it is! Oh! - Okay, you have a good grip? - Yeah. I'm gonna start to climb down you now. - All right, just hurry up. - Okay. Now, should I climb down your front so we're face to face... ...or should I climb down your back so we're... ...butt to face? - Face to face. - I like face to face. - Okay, here I come. - All right. Oh, my... How much do you weigh, Ross? I prefer not to answer. I'm still carrying a little holiday weight. When we talked about face to face... ...I don't think we thought it all the way through. - What do you want me to do? - Just shimmy down me and drop. - Hi. - Hi. You know, maybe I should hang, and you should climb down me. Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while! - It still looks pretty far. - It's not that far. Just drop. Do not rush me! My pants are starting to come down, and I'm not wearing any underwear. My ankle! I really hurt my ankle! I think I twisted it when... A quarter! That really was some of your best work. I told you. I can't believe it. I've only got two hours until I call in sick for work. I have to be up in seven minutes. Well, you're not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes... . Really? You want to? You get the vacuum cleaner. I'll get the furniture polish. <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"
713,"- Hey. - Hi. - What are you doing? - I was thinking of moving the couch. Why would you want to do that? So there'd be a decent place for me to sit? - Rach, there is a decent place. - And your lap does not count. - Come on, help me move this. - No, no, no. - No? - No. Rosita does not move. I'm sorry. Rosita? As in...? As in ""Rosita does not move. "" It's just a chair. What's the big deal? It's the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen... ...and it's at an angle where you don't get any glare coming off Stevie. Stevie the TV? - Is there a problem? - No. What does he know? Come on, Rosita. Us <i>chicas</i> gotta stick together. You bitch! The One Where Rosita Dies English Subtitles by SDI Media Group Hey, Ross? I checked the real estate section. Look at this. Looks like Mom and Dad's house. Even has a tree with a broken limb out front. And the window in the attic... . Oh, my God! What happened to the window in the attic? - I can't believe they're selling it. - And they didn't tell us. What happened to the window in the attic? I'll buy you a new one, okay? We'll go to the store and get you a new chair right now. She's not even cold yet. Wouldn't Rosita have wanted you to move on? I mean, you know, she did always put your comfort first. That's true. I can't believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man, some stranger's gonna be in my room. For 15 years they kept it as a shrine to you. It's time the velvet ropes came down. They kept your room a while. Please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out. I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria's Secret catalogs? Not a gym. - Come on. You know they love you. - As much as they love you? They thought she was barren until I was born. It's not my fault. I hate this year. What's wrong with this year? It's February and I've only given two massages... ...and they were both horrible tippers. That was me and Ross. Oh, that's right. If you want some extra cash... ...some college friends made good money doing telemarketing. It'd be better than the last telephone job I had. I probably won't have to say ""spank"" as much. What? Oh, yeah, like you never called. This is very easy. You read from the script... ...and try to sell as much toner as you can. Okay, I can do that. By the way, I love my office. - Why don't we do a trial run? - Oh, okay. All right. Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies. - Can I speak to your supply manager? - I'm the supply manager. I'd like to talk about your toner needs. We don't need any. Okay, sorry to bother you. Bye-bye. Yeah, you're right. This is easy. Okay. What was wrong with that call? Oh, well, all right. No offense, but you were kind of rude. They always say they don't need toner. That's okay. Whatever they say, you can find the answer to it, here in the script. So I think you're ready to sell toner. - Do you have any last questions? - No. Wait, yes, I do have one question: What is toner? Joey? Joe? Full bag? Beer's still cold. Something terrible must have happened here. Oh, no, no, no! Stevie, I was never here. - Dad? - I'm here! - Hey. - Hi. Seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work. We can't believe you're selling the house. Time for a new family to start here. I hope their check clears before they find the crack... ...in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling. Let's grab our stuff and get the hell out of here. - Sorry we can't store your things. - Oh, it's okay. I can't wait to see everything again. I don't know what's down here. But there are six or seven Easy-Bake Ovens in the attic. I used to love to play restaurant. Not as much as you loved to play ""uncooked batter eater. "" You can't expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies. So I think your boxes are over here. Oh, great. Hey... ...whose cigarettes are these? I don't know. They must be your mother's. But please, please don't ask her. I'll throw these away. Cool! Dad, my report cards! Hey, check this out. Math, ""A. "" Science, ""A. "" History, ""A. "" Gym... . My rock polisher! - Uh-oh. - What? You know how the garage floods every spring? How are you ever gonna sell this place? I think I accidentally used Monica's boxes... ...to keep the water away from the Porsche. Oh, no, Dad. Dad? What the... Oh, God. Everything's ruined! Dad, she's gonna be crushed. You don't secretly smoke, do you? No. So it's just your mother then. Hi. This is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies. Can I speak to your supply manager, please? Earl. Thanks. Hi, Earl. This is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies. I'd like to talk to you about your toner needs. I don't need any toner. I hear what you're saying, but at our prices, everyone needs toner. Not me. May I ask why? You want to know why? You want to know why? I surely do. <i>Okay. </i> I don't need any toner... ...because I'm gonna kill myself. Is that because you're out of toner? Okay, so no toner today. Thanks anyway. Bye-bye. Wait, wait! I can't let you hang up. Just please talk to me. Well... . I only had one thing to do today. I guess I could push it back. Yeah. Now, why do you want to kill yourself? I've been working for 10 years now at this... ...meaningless, dead-end job... ...and nobody here even knows that I exist. Chandler? I'm sorry? Look... ...I'm sure that people know you exist. Oh, yeah? I work in a cubicle... ...surrounded by people. I've been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself... ...and no one's even looked up from their desk. Hang on. Hey, everybody... ...I'm gonna kill myself. I got nothing. Good chair. Now, if anybody asks... ...your name is Rosita. Poor thing. Cut down in her prime. Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should move Rosita out of here. Start the healing process. Yeah, I guess you're right. She's healed! That's weird. No, it's not weird. It's a miracle! It's not a miracle. I'm sure there's an explanation. There is. If your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen. She'll understand. I didn't do it on purpose. Dad, that won't matter to her. Look, all my stuff is safe and dry. And all her stuff is... ...growing new stuff. This is the kind of thing... ...that makes her think you love me more than her. My God. Does she think that? Well, can you blame her? We may have favored you unconsciously. You were a marvel. - The doctors said your mom couldn't... - I don't want to hear it. - Really? - Well, not right now. Monica came here for some memories. Damn it, we'll give her some. Okay, grab... . Grab some boxes. We'll take stuff from mine... ...and whatever we can pass off as hers, we'll put in there. Like, this. She could have made this. - This could have been hers. - Sure. If you want to tell the medical marvel story while we work, that'd be fine. I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself. Yeah. Me too. You know, this thing has speakers in the headrest? - No, really? - Yeah. You can hook it to the TV and you get radio. My chair heals itself. All right. Let's just forget about the people at the office, okay? There's gotta be someone worth sticking around for. What about family or friends? Maybe a girlfriend? Yeah, right. Oh, sorry. Boyfriend? Okay, I should... ...be getting back to my thing now. See you. I'm not finished! Don't you dare hang up on me! The new girl's good. Which boxes are mine? - These are yours right here. - Okay. A coloring book. You loved that thing. You never went anywhere without... ...without that coloring book. Really? Looks like I had trouble staying in the lines. Nuh-uh! Wow, look at this. I can't believe I even fit into this shirt. Oh, this is yours. I don't know how that got in there. Hey, this isn't my stuff. Ross, these are your boxes. Where are my boxes? The garage flooded, sweetie, and ruined your boxes. I'm sorry. Just mine? I'm afraid so. Why wasn't Ross' stuff ruined? I used your boxes to divert water away from the Porsche. Ross' stuff is fine, but I have no memories... ...so you could keep the bottom of your car from water? There was also leaves and gook and stuff. I can't believe this! Screw it. I'm having one. - Hey, Chandler. - Hey. How'd you like to sit in a chair that reclines... ...has a rolling massage... ...and speakers in the headrest? I've tried that so many times... ...they won't even let me in the store anymore. What if I said you could do it in my apartment? Are you telling me... ...you bought the chair that makes all others obsolete? The chair that <i>Sit Magazine</i> called ""Chair of the Year""? I just purchased... ...the La-Z-Boy E-Cliner 3000. Well, that's awesome! That's great! What made you do it? It's a long story, but, I broke Joey's chair... Whoa, whoa, whoa. You broke Joey's chair? I thought I did, that's why I replaced it with mine. That's how it got fixed! You thought that elves came in and fixed it? No. Angels. I'm getting my chair back. Well, looks like it wasn't healed after all! I guess this chair's mine now. Joey, you broke my chair! Your chair? He thought he broke it, so he switched chairs. So there was no miracle? No, Joe. No miracle. Oh, no! This is devastating! My faith is shaken. I'm glad I have a new chair to get me through this. Where can I find Earl? He's the supply manager here. I don't know any Earl. I'm right here! Earl? I'm Phoebe. Phoebe? The lady who sells toner? Look, you can't kill yourself. Look, I really appreciate you coming down... No, I can't let you do it. - Why? - Because, fate made me call you today. I thought it was toner. Think about it, okay? This isn't even my regular job. My first day, you're my first call. Somebody else may have hung up, but I wouldn't do that... ...because I know about this stuff. - My mom killed herself. - Really? How? I'm not gonna give you tips. Don't you see that this... ...all came together so I could stop you from doing this? - Couldn't it just be a coincidence? - No, it's fate. It doesn't really seem like enough to be fate. Oh, well. Okay, here's a weird thing. My mother was also a supply manager. I'm actually the office manager. Oh, my God! So was she! And get this, okay. Your name is Earl, right? Her name was Pearl. Puh-Earl. Was there anything else? Sure. Where're you from? - Philadelphia. - Oh, my God, so was she! I've got goose bumps. Really? I'm wearing layers, and it's warm. These jerks might not care about you... ...but the universe does, and that says a lot. Did you hear that? I don't need you guys to care about me... ...because the universe cares! The whole universe! I really wish they'd care a little bit. Oh, this is terrible. Everything is destroyed. Look at this. It meant enough for me to save, and now I can't tell what it is. It's still soft. What do you think this is? I think it was a mouse. - How are you, honey? - How do you think I am? You've wrecked my childhood memories... ...you love Ross more than me. And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face. Sweetheart, we love you just as much as Ross. I'm sorry about what happened... ...and I probably can't make it up to you... ...but here's a start. - What's this? - It's the key to my Porsche. Well, the key to your Porsche. What? What?! I've considered getting rid of it. I saw my reflection the other day. Your mother's right, I do look like an ass. You're giving it to me? You're kidding. Well, wait a minute. A couple of stupid boxes get wet, and she gets a Porsche? - Let's take a drive? - All right! What about me? I'm a medical marvel! Hey, guys. Have you seen Chandler's chair? Joey broke it. He got rid of it. Are you kidding? I get a Porsche and the Barcalounger's gone? This is the best day ever! <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"
714,"Happy birthday! Happy birthday! Rach, come on. It's your birthday! Hey... . She's not as pretty as she was when she was 29. Ms. Greene wants to establish some ground rules before she comes out. Please don't use the words ""old"" or ""downhill""... ...or ""They still look pretty damn good. "" They do. Rachel, come on out. Monica made breakfast. Chocolate chip pancakes. We've got presents. Good ones? They're all from the list you gave us two weeks ago. Can I keep the presents and still be 29? Come on, Rach, turning 30 is not that big a deal. Really? Is that how you felt when you turned 30? Why, God, why? We had a deal. Let the others grow old, not me! You guys, is it just me? Am I overreacting? No, it's not just you. My 30th birthday sure wasn't much fun. And now Chandler! We're all getting so old. Why are You doing this to us? The One Where They All Turn Thirty English Subtitles by SDI Media Group You're in a great place in your life. You have an amazing job, good friends. Your roommate's a soap opera star. Your character is in a coma. I promised myself I wouldn't cry at this one. I know my life's going pretty well, but I see so many people... ...who've accomplished their goals before they're 30. Yeah, but you shouldn't compare yourself to me. - Come on, Phoebe! - You can do it! - Come on. - There you go. I did it! One mile on a Hippity Hop. That's everything I wanted to do before I was 30. Except I wanted to patch things up with my sister. Oh, well. But, yeah! Girls, this thing is a godsend, if you know what I mean. Let's have some fun. What do you want to do? I don't want to do anything. Doing nothing on your 30th is better than doing something stupid, like Ross. That was a practical purchase. I needed that car for transportation. Okay? I have a child. How hot do I look in this? Ross, a sports car? Wouldn't it be cheaper to just stuff a sock down there? That's not what this is about. I am a sports car enthusiast. - I've always been into cars. - What's the horsepower? I don't know, but look how shiny! - I can't believe you bought this. - So can I have a ride, stud? Hop in. Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life. Damn it. Okay, who's next? I am gonna do something today. I won't sit around like some old lady. I want to get something pierced. Like my nose or my tongue or something. Really? Because that hurts. So what? The way I see it... Son of a bitch! Look, I know what you're going through. I'm totally freaked out about turning 25. Get out of my apartment. Rach, I think that you're doing great. Let's face it, no one handles this well. Least of all you. Put that back on. Monica will be here any minute. But it hurts my Joey's apple. For the last time, it's not named after each individual man. You've done a wonderful job with the party. Everything's so lovely. Well, not as lovely as you. I can't believe you have a 30-year-old daughter. And I can't believe you have a tux that's 30 years old. It's older than that. Ross was conceived right near this tuxedo. Everybody hide! She's coming. Everybody down! Everybody stay here. I'll find out what's going on. Hey, you got the door open! Hey, are you drunk? No. Okay. Okay. See, I was a little nervous about turning... ...30. So the busboys took me out for some drinks. Might want to puke on you later. Here's the thing. We've thrown a very formal surprise party for you. - Your parents and friends are in there. - No! - Yes! Yes! - No. Oh, no! My parents have never seen me drunk. That they know of. We'll get you some coffee. They'll never know that you're drunk. - You promise? - I'll take care of it. I love you so much. Okay, we have to do something about your breath. What about your breath? That's still yours. Now remember, it's a surprise party. So when you go in, act surprised. Ready? Surprise! Okay, forward. Forward. Stop! Okay, back... Stop! Okay, for... Stop! Stop! Stop! Okay, here's what we're gonna do. I'll break into this minivan, put it in neutral. You push it forward so Ross can get out of the spot. All right. Here we go. Haul ass! Happy 30th birthday! Here. It's for the child in you. And the woman. Happy 30th! Why do you keep saying that? Because it's our 30th birthday. Yeah, no, we're not 30. We're 31. Okay. Wait. Oh, it's you. Yeah. What? Yeah, we're not 30. We're 31. That's what it says on my birth certificate. You have a birth certificate? I got a big box of family stuff when my mom died. Our mom. Right. Okay. - Do you have mine? - No, I sold it to a Swedish runaway. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, we are 31! Yeah. I just lost a whole year of my life. Okay. - Your middle name is Pamela? - Yes. I never knew mine. Do you remember what it is? Yes. Phoebe. - That's my first name. - Right. Okay. Then, no. We made it across the room. You're doing great. What's going on? Monica's a little drunk. Yeah! I love drunk Monica. Oh, she's so much more fun than regular Monica. She doesn't want her parents to know. All right, all right. Here's what we'll do. I'll get twice as drunk, then no one will even notice her. What's going on? Monica's wasted. Maybe that'll liven up this party. Will you just help her get changed? Taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey. This one's from me. It wasn't on your list, but it's really fun. A scooter. Stick to the list. Always stick to the list. No, no, I love it. Thank you. Open ours next! Open ours next! Now that you're a couple, we don't get two gifts? For my last birthday, you gave me a hug. Read the card! Read the card! ""Happy birthday, Grandma. It's better to be over the hill... ...than buried under it. All our love, Monica and Chandler. "" That's funny. No, no. That was a joke. I know, I get it. It's funny. Because you're not a grandma. To be a grandma, you have to be married and have children. I don't have any of those things. That's why it's so funny. I'm just gonna go... . All you had to do was buy the card. It was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See, I want three kids. And you want to have them all at the same time and all for your brother. As I was saying... . I should have the first one by the time I'm 35. Which gives me five years. If I want a kid when I'm 35, I don't have to get pregnant until I'm 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes. But I want to be married for a year before I get pregnant. Really? That long? Look all you want, it's happening. I don't have to get married until I'm 33. That's three whole years. Wait a minute, though. I'll need a year and a half to plan the wedding. And I'd like to know the guy for a year, year and a half... ...before we get engaged. Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I'm 30. Which is fine because you just turned... ...28! No, Ross. No, it is not fine. I should already be with the guy I'm gonna marry. Will you quit hogging it? I'm telling you, it's like watching Bambi learn how to walk. You're drunk. Mom and Dad are gonna be mad. Maybe I'm a little drunk. Are those crab cakes? I told you to come straight to me when they were ready. How you feeling? You are so handsome. I want to make love to you right here, right now. I really wish that you wouldn't. Just get through a little bit more, then we can put you in bed. Just smile, and don't talk to anyone. Speech, speech! Let's hear from the birthday girl. Pheebs! See, everybody's looking at me. The plan's working. I didn't even have to take off my top yet. Speech. Come on, speech! You can't keep your hands off her for one second. I think it's nice. I think it's necessary. I want to thank you all for coming. My family and... ...my friends. I'd really like to say that I'm... . You know what I'd really like to say? I'm drunk! That's right, Mom and Dad. Your little old ""Harmomica"" is hammered. And guess what? I've been drunk before. And I've smoked a cigarette. It's all okay. It's okay because... ...I turned 30 today. And I can do anything I want. Because I am a grownup. Okay, quick. Help me get this off. I lost a whole year. I can't believe it. This is so unfair! Come on, Pheebs, it'll be okay. Will it? Will it? How would you feel if you found out you were 31? That's not gonna happen. Because we have a new deal. Plus, it ruined my schedule. I haven't done the things I wanted to do before I was 31. Like what? Like I haven't met any Portuguese people. I haven't had the perfect kiss. And I haven't been to sniper school. Why don't we go and have some birthday cake? I just feel like being by myself. See you guys later. Thanks. Poor Pheebs. Hey, you guys, I think I'm gonna walk her home. - Oh, man. - What? He's gonna eat the cake. Pheebs! Listen, I... . Close your eyes. That's one thing to cross off your list. Oh, yeah. Plus, I'm one-sixteenth Portuguese. Okay, is everybody clear? We're gonna pick it up... ...and move it. All we need is teamwork. We're gonna lift the car... ...and slide it out. Lift... ...and slide. - Ross, I really don't think this... - Lift... ...and slide. - Okay, here we go. - All right, everyone. Lift... ...and slide. - Hey, Joey... - Come on, Rach, my turn just started. Actually, I just want to talk to Tag. Oh, okay. Hey, can I ride this outside? Whatever. I'm not your mother. Not in the street! - Are you feeling any better? - Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm... . Let's talk. What's up? Oh, Tag... . You're such a great guy. And we have so much fun together. - But l... - Wait. I think I see where you're going. Before you say anything else, can I say one more thing? Well said. And a good example of the fun I was referring to. But I think I'm past the point where I can just have fun. Don't do this. This is just because you're turning 30. Yeah, it is. But you're just a kid. I mean, you're 25. - Twenty-four, actually. - Oh, God. You know what I wish? I wish you were six years older. Well, if I'm wishing for stuff, I wish I was six years younger. - Me too. - Yeah. Sorry. Hey, how'd it go? If I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year? You did the right thing. I don't like this anymore. Well, here we are. Just a bunch of 30-year-olds. Do you realize in 10 years we're gonna be 40? Why, God? Why are you doing this to us? Yes! My baby's finally free. All right! Start it up. Let's go! How hot are we? You want to buy a car? <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"
715,"Thanks for coming by. We wanted to bounce some ideas off of you about the wedding ceremony. - What's the matter? Are you okay? - It's just... . Monica said ""wedding. "" We thought one of you could read something. Okay, yeah, I guess I can do that too. Too? I kind of have something else planned for you guys. - Do you mind telling us what it is? - Sorry. I'm kind of keeping this one on the QT. Whatever it is, I hope it involves winking. - Hey. - Hey. I talked to one of the <i>DOOL</i> writers... - What is <i>DOOL</i>? <i>-Days Of Our Lives. </i> You won't believe it. My character is coming out of his coma! - That's wonderful. - Wow, Joey. And not only that. I'm getting a new brain! So great things are happening at work and in your personal life. You're getting a new brain? They're killing off one of the characters... ...and her brain is being transplanted into my body. What? A brain transplant? It's ridiculous. It's ridiculous that you haven't had sex in three months. It's winter. There are fewer people on the street. Who are they killing off? Cecilia Monroe. She plays Jessica Lockhart. No! She is so good at throwing drinks in people's faces. I don't think I've ever seen her finish a drink. The way she slaps people. Wouldn't you love to? Don't do it. And she's been on the show forever. It's gonna be really hard to fill her shoes. Help me out here. When you come out of the brain transplant... ...you are going to be her? Yes, but in Drake Ramoray's body. Why is this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist. The One With Joey's New Brain English Subtitles by SDI Media Group Rach, so that guy there: Straight or gay? Oh, yeah, he's too cute to be straight. Knockers will help us figure it out. All right, straight. And not subtle. He left his cell phone. We could have Gunther put it in lost and found. Or we could use it to call China, see how those guys are doing. What if he calls his own cell phone and I answer... ...and we start talking and we fell in love? Would that be a great story? Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age. That does sound great. I'm getting the phone. What? Wait. Why do you get the story? I haven't been out on a date in so long. Phoebe, you had a date three days ago. That wasn't a date. That was friends getting together and having sex. Okay. Great. I get the phone. No way. You just broke up with Tag a week ago. Yeah, and until now, I didn't think I would love again. - Nice try. - Wait. How do we fairly decide who gets the phone? I don't know. Maybe we could... . Ah-ha! Too slow! Ah-ha! Too cocky. I'm dating him. There's nothing you can do. Yes, there is. Are you going to kill him like you did Charles? Oh, my baby. <i>Cut! </i> That was great. And that slap looked so real. How do you do that? - Oh, just years of experience. - Can I get some ice here?! I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are. You're not the fan who's dying, are you? I'm Joey Tribbiani. We did a scene together yesterday. - I'm the guy in the coma. - Oh, that was a real person? Since I'm getting your brain when you leave the show... ...I was wondering if... - I'm leaving the show? - Why? Did you hear something? Who told you that? - One of the writers. - Was it bald or was it tall? You know, it doesn't matter, because it is not true. Okay. And if it were true, how dare you come to me and ask me for tips... ...about a character I've played for 20 years! Miss Monroe... Oh, there you go. Okay, look, I have an idea. Why don't we see what kind of numbers he has on his speed dial... ...and then whoever has more in common with him gets the phone. - Fine. All right. - All right. First name on the speed dial is ""Mom. "" Oh. I lost my mom to suicide. You can't use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin. Did I use that already today? Sorry. ""Ben, Carlos, David..."" Oh, I win. He's got Barney's on his speed dial. You don't know it's Barney's the store. That could be his friend's house, a bar... Who has Barney's the store on their speed dial? His new girlfriend. What is that? I think it's the Dying Cat Parade. Sounds like it's coming from across the street. - Oh, my God. - What? The thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding? He was hanging out with me and said, ""You're half Scottish, right?"" No. There is no way. It cannot be Ross. Unbelievable. Why is your family Scottish? Why is your family Ross? He cannot play at our wedding. I mean, come on. That is just noise! It's not even a song. Wait. If you listen very carefully... ...I think it's ""Celebration"" by Kool and the Gang. You're right. They are writing me out of the show. They don't know exactly when it's going to happen, but soon... ...and then that's it. If it was up to me, you would never leave the show. - Yeah, thanks. - I mean it. I can't believe they'd do this to you. And to your fans. They're gonna be devastated. Heartbroken. They love you so much. Oh, you're right. Thank you. What's your name again? - Joey. - Thank you. That is so sweet. The only reason I came up to you before... ...is because, well... ...I'm really nervous about being you. If you could help me capture the essence of the character... . Help me keep Jessica alive. Please? Joey, I will help you. Not because I owe it to this stupid show... ...but because I owe it to Jessica. - Oh, thank you so much. - You're so welcome. I've been watching some tapes. How's this? Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again! Never! Jessica doesn't have an English accent. I can do an English accent? That baby's going on my resume. - Hi. How are you? - Good. Remember when we were in the coffeehouse... ...we decided I was gonna keep the cute guy's phone? I was gonna keep it in my purse, so if it rang, I could just pick it up? Do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone? Ooh, now you lost me. - You stole the phone. - No, I didn't. You're saying if I called it, it wouldn't ring? - No. - Okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag. Oh, it does work. - Phoebe. - That is a different phone. Oh, is it? Hello. Yes, hi. Is Rachel there? Yes, she is. Just one moment, please. It's for me! That is damning evidence. Oh, my God. I bet that's him. My digital fairy tale's about to begin. Would you stop doing that? Hello? Yes, I'm the one who found your phone. - Phoebe, you can't... - Shh, I'm on a call. Yeah, you can pick it up tonight. Say, 8:30? At my apartment. It's 5 Morton Street, apartment 14. And then maybe, you know, after, we can grab a bite to eat or whatever. Okay. Okay, I'll see you then. Bye. I will be here when he comes over. How will you know what time to come over? You just said it. Oh. The essence of the character is rooted in her confidence. So when Jessica enters a room, for instance... ...she owns everything... ...and every person in that room. - You try it. - Okay. He's not mad at the room. Try it again. He owns it. He owns the room. It is his. He owns, owns, owns the room! He owns it! It's a little weird, but it's getting better. I'm gonna miss this woman so much. I don't know what I'm gonna do. It's been 20 years of my life. Hey, hey. Maybe this is a good thing. It'll give you a chance to shake things up. Play different characters. You're so talented. Probably should've just left years ago when the offers were pouring in... ...but I just got so comfy here and... . I turned down some amazing work. Like what? Well, let's just say if I'd left 15 years ago... ...the landscape of Mexican cinema would be very different today. Wow. But, well, now... . Now's a different time for me. Oh, hey, come on. Don't do this. Let me tell you something, okay? When I watch you do a scene, I'm thinking, ""She is a great actress. "" But I'm also thinking, ""She is hot. "" You think I'm hot? You own the room. We should probably get the... . Oh, yeah. Yeah, we should get... So when Jessica kisses a man... ...she usually puts... ...both her hands on the man's face. I notice that. Is that because she's so passionate? No, it's because that way the camera only sees her. You want to try it? Yeah, okay. That was good. That was really good. But I think that maybe your hands are just a little off. They should... Well, I feel like a snack. Do you want some shortbread? It's Scottish, like you are. Oh, no, thanks. I don't like anything from my Scottish heritage. What? Well, it's just that my entire family was run out of Scotland by... ...Vikings. It sounds like your family's ready to rediscover its Scottish roots. You can't play bagpipes at the wedding! How did you know? - We heard you play from our apartment. - Were you the ones who called the cops? That's not really important right now. What is important is, while we appreciate the gesture... ...we just don't feel that bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding. - Why not? - Because we hate them. Just give me a chance to perform for you, then decide whatever you want. I'm not gonna tell you what song I'm gonna play, either. Let's just say when it's over... ...I'll bet there'll be a wee bit o' celebration. Hey, hey! Who is it? It's Tom. I'm here to pick up the phone. Why do you get to answer the door? - Why shouldn't I? - Because it's my apartment. Then I get to give him the phone. Okay. Good luck explaining all the calls to China. Hi. Wow, how long were we arguing for? You're not the man who left the phone. - No, that's my assistant. - Is he coming? No. - Could you give us one second? - Sure. We'll be right back, sir. - What do we do? - I don't know. Can you believe this? We were waiting for a hot guy and a hotter one shows up. I know... What? Rachel, listen... ...if you let me have him, then I will really owe you one. All right. All right, I will let you have him. But you owe me. You owe me big. Which one of you will I take to dinner? Oh, that'd be me, sir. <i>Nice. </i> Well, you certainly own that room. Actually, I rent the whole place. I just got what you meant. Thank you. - Hi. - Hey. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, Jessica Lockhart! In my apartment! I am such a huge fan. I am such a huge fan. It's nice to know... Monica! That's my roommate, Rachel. That explains the women's underwear. Sure. Oh, my God, it's true! Can I just ask you to do me just one favor? Certainly. Would you slap me right here in the face? I'd love to, but my lawyer said I can't do that anymore. All right, here we go. No, wait. Just one moment. - You're a stupid bitch. - I really can't slap you. - My God, you're great. - Thanks for stopping by. - I am so sorry about that. - Oh, no. Being adored, I'm used to it. Don't worry about it. - Oh, my God. - What? They sent me today's script. They never send me the script. - They don't? - I'm in a coma. This must mean I have lines. Oh. How does it happen? You get thrown from a horse into an electric fence. A what? Jessica hates horses. After this she's not gonna be crazy about electricity, either. Loosening the saddle on Mother's horse was brilliant, Fredrick. And the electric fence, inspired. Thank you, sweetheart. I can't believe she's really gone. Look around you. All of this is ours. I don't think so. Who are you? What's the matter, Dina? Don't you recognize your own... ...mother? <i>Cut! That was great, everybody. </i> <i>Thank you. </i> That was so wonderful! I think that you're a better Jessica than I ever was. - Oh, no. - Of course not, but you were good. Thanks. Good news. I got another job. Great. Hey, all right! What is it? A film in Guadalajara. The airport? No, that's LaGuardia. - This is Mexico. - Oh, wow. Well, how long will you be gone? Eight months. - That's a really long time. - Yeah, but you could come and visit. I bet you could own a few places down there. Oh, you know, I should probably buy a place in the city first. And I just got what you meant. That is... - That's a tricky one. - It's tricky. Good luck. You too. Now, remember, I'm still learning. One, two, three, four! You know this song. Sing along. So? No! <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"

That's Rachel. But whatever. Could you do me a big favor? I have a meeting at the dean's office. Can you watch Ben for an hour? - What about Monica? - She isn't home. So it would just be me alone?

I don't like the idea of me saying, ""I do""... ...while he's thinking, ""I'd do it too. "" - Well, then we still have a problem. - With what? We need someone to perform our wedding but they're all boring or annoying... ...or keep staring at the ladies. You should have one of us do it. We're getting ""married"" married, not ""6th-grade"" married. No, it's a real thing. Anyone can be ordained on the Internet and perform weddings and stuff. I call it! What? It was my idea! Thank you very much, but neither of you is marrying us. Does calling it not mean anything anymore? We're having a legitimate clergy member. And when I say legitimate, I mean gay... ...and in control of his saliva. Ben, you know, when you were a baby... ...we'd hang out all the time. I was your daddy's girlfriend. But you're not anymore. - No, I'm not. - Because you guys were on a break... Hey, we were not on a... - When's my daddy coming back? - Fifty-two minutes. So no brothers or sisters, huh? You know what, I had two sisters and we just tortured each other. - Really? Like how? - Well, you know, we would, um... ...we'd repeat everything the other said... ...or we'd jump out of closets to scare each other... ...or switch the sugar with salt so they put salt on their cereal. That's a good one. - Yeah, you like that one? - Yeah, you're funny. I'm funny? Oh, thank God. Well, hey, I got a ton of these. You take a quarter... ...and you blacken the edge, right?

That is exactly why I've come here to talk to you, okay? - Rachel, you want sugar? - Yes, but... Do I want sugar in my coffee? No, just some milk would be good, Carol. Thanks. Remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday? ""Remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?"" - Don't do that. - ""Don't do that. "" - Your dad doesn't like pranks. - ""Your dad doesn't like pranks. "" - Oh, damn it. - ""Oh, damn it! "" No! Don't say that. - Damn it! - Go back to repeating. - Damn it! - Oh, crap. ""Oh, crap! "" Okay, I got some more written, ready? Yeah, okay. ""When I think of the love that these two givers and receivers share... ...I can't help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving... ...and giving..."" And then I can't think of a good word for right here. - How about ""receiving""? - Yes! See, Joe, not that that's not great... ...but one cool thing about having a friend perform the ceremony... ...is that it can be about us. It can be more personal. You can tell stories about us. Okay! Maybe I'll talk about London, when you hooked up. Only I won't say ""hooked up""... ...I'll say, ""began their beautiful journey... - There you go. ...by doing it. "" - Joe. - Okay, all right. So how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room... ...then you're in the bathtub and she's feeding you strawberries? - Isn't that what happened to you? - Yeah! I call that ""London style. "" That didn't happen with us. Maybe you should say it is, because ""London style"" sounds nice. Okay, uh... . I was sad that night because this guy thought I was Ross' mom. And Chandler was really sweet and he consoled me and... ...we drank too much. - Yeah, baby. I was a gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said good night. Oh. - But then, later that night... - Yeah, baby. Cute P.J.s. Really living it up here in London, huh? Well, I wasn't exactly expecting company after... ...9:15. Is Joey here? Last I saw he was with a bridesmaid and a bucket of strawberries. You're not still upset about what that guy told you, are you? Wouldn't you be? It's been a really emotional time and you've had a lot to drink... . You have to let that go, okay? You were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight. Really? You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... Whoa, what's going on? We just made out. - We're making out? - Not anymore. - But we don't do that. - I know, I thought it would be fun. How drunk are you? Enough to know I want to do this. Not so much that you should feel guilty. That's the perfect amount. - You know what's weird? - What? - This doesn't feel weird. - I know. - You're a really good kisser. - Well, I have kissed over four women. Want to get under the covers? Okay. Wow, you are really fast! It bodes well for me that speed impresses you. - We're gonna see each other naked. - Yep. - At the same time? - Count of three? One, two, three. Well, I think it's safe to say our friendship is effectively ruined. Eh, we weren't that close anyway. Joey, Joey, Joey...! Hey. Hey, Joe. I was just watching a movie... . Oh, dude, I'm so sorry. No! It's cool, I'm still with my bridesmaid. Where are the condoms? In my bag over there. Could you leave me one? For just you? Yeah. All right. There you go, buddy. Go nuts. That's what that was? If I hadn't left you one, you two might've never gotten together. Imagine if I had sent that hooker like I was gonna? It's like it was in the stars. Yeah, totally meant to be. Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night. - What? - What? What? Who did you originally want to hook up with? Okay, fine, but please don't be upset. I was really depressed, okay? And really drunk. I wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted sex. So, when I went to your room that night... ...I was actually looking for Joey. Yeah, baby. No, baby. Oh, my God. You came looking for Joey? - Were you planning on telling me this? - No, I didn't think it was important. It's not important? It's not important? If it wasn't for a bridesmaid, you'd be marrying him. Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey wasn't there? Hey! I'm a man of the cloth but I still have feelings. There's no way you're doing this wedding now, okay? What? That's not fair. It's not my fault. I was with my bridesmaid. And who's to say I would've said yes? I mean, I would've said yes. You are making way too big a deal out of this. Everything worked out okay. It's just weird, okay? I don't want to be saying my vows with the mental image of you and Monica. I need... I don't know what I need. I need a walk. - Wait, Chandler, it's not a big deal. - It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman and settled for Robin. - This is crazy. - No, Robin is so gay. - So now what have we agreed? - No more pranks. - What else? - You and Daddy were not on a break. Very good. Rachel, what are you doing here? I'm just visiting my good friend Carol. - Your good friend? - Yeah. What's her last name? Carol... ...Lesbian. - Nice. By the way, that line down my face... . The line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say: ""Dude, don't you ever wash your face?"" I'm sorry I didn't tell you. I don't want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. - Okay? - Fine. Fine. Once I taught him that stuff, he called me ""fun Aunt Rachel. "" And I loved being fun Aunt Rachel. I'm glad you guys were bonding but... Look, he doesn't have any siblings. Somebody has to teach him this stuff. I haven't taught him anything a normal 6-year-old doesn't know. - Crap! - I gotta go. - Hey. - Hey. You want this scone? It came for me but it would rather sleep with you. Nothing even happened. I just don't want you to be upset. How can I not be upset? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman... ...and it turns out she wanted you first. Yeah, for like a half an hour one night. Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life. We look at you and we see you together, and it just... ...it fits, you know? And you just know it's gonna last forever. That's what you should say. What? When you're marrying us, that's what you should say. Really? I could do it? I'd love you to do it. Hey. But those are the words. Those exact words. Well, I don't remember exactly but... ...it's pretty much about having and giving and sharing and receiving. - So you guys doing okay? - Yeah. We talked and Monica made me see that I overreacted a little bit. - Some things are more important. - Yeah, baby. I'm really glad you guys are okay, but I just keep thinking... ...what would've happened if you two had hooked up. Honey, dinner's ready! What's my little chef got for me tonight? - Your favorite. - Ho, ho, ho... ...fried stuff with cheese. And lots of it! Thanks, sweetheart. Give me a little sugar... . Here we go, here we go, here we go. How you doing? - Hey. - Hey! I'm sorry to do this again, but could you look after Ben for a bit? I've got this meeting at school... ...and he asked for his fun Aunt Rachel. Well, of course I will watch him. We have fun, don't we, Ben? - See you later, pal. - Okay. Wait a minute. Ben, I can't do it. - You got something on your back. - What? That's great. That is great. What did we just finish talking about, Ben? ""What did we just finish talking about, Ben?"" That's it! Come here! - You're in big trouble, young man! - No, wait. Ben, come here! I am not kidding! You guys, hold it. Seriously... Oh, my God! <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"

I used to go all over town listening to bands. - Chandler? - Gap commercial. - Did you book them? Did you call? - I will. - You want me to call? - I'll do it. You stick to your job. - What is your job? - Staying out of the way. This is impossible. Why don't you just pick all 15? - There were only 12. - Oh, yeah, I added 3.

Being engaged, I'm not nervous to talk to pretty girls anymore. Could you guys help me? Yeah, let me get that for you. - It's really heavy. - I got it. So hi, I'm Ross, and this is my friend, Chandler. I'm Kristen. Hi. Are you new to the area? I'd love to show you around sometime. I actually just moved from four blocks over. But this block is like another world. Actually, it does have a very interesting history. This street is the first in the city to have an underground sewer system. Before that, sewage and waste... ...would just flow right down the street. Sometimes ankle-deep. Smooth. Excuse me? You're gonna be starving after moving. What do you say I take you to dinner? - I'd like that. - Great. Let me take this up. - After you. - Oh, no. After you. Oh, my God! Am I crazy, or does this totally go? Oh, my God! You look so beautiful! Thank you, Rachel. But look at Monica! This is it. Yeah, this is the one. I can't believe I found it. Wow, you look so beautiful. If I knew you, I'd cry. I'm Monica Geller. Ball like a baby. I'm Megan Bailey. - Have you found your dress? - These dresses are amazing... ...but I couldn't afford one. - I can't either. I'm here to figure out the one I want, then I'll get it at Kleinman's. They're having a huge sale. - Thanks for the tip. - When are you getting married? - I'm not. I just like to try them on. - I do the same thing. I'm just kidding. I'm getting married July 25th. I'm just kidding too. I'm getting married in December. - When are you getting married? - May 15th. It's close. Who's your photographer? - Jeffrey. - We met with him. - Did he show you nude wedding photos? - The Best Man? Wow! I know. I almost called off my wedding. - Who's your band? - My fianc wants The Swing Kings. You're lucky. My fianc wants the heavy metal band, Carcass. Is that spelled with a ""C"" or a ""K""? It doesn't matter, they're both great! Oh, don't buy that here. Now that you know what you want, go to Kleinman's. This place is so overpriced. I own this store. So does this come in another color, or... . Hi. You moving in or moving out? - Moving in. - Can I help out? Okay, but be careful. The guy who was helping before hurt his back. - Boyfriend? - No. I'm Joey. Kristen. What a beautiful name. What is it again? Kristen. - You live around here? - Right down there. Let me give you a tip. Don't take a nap on this stoop. You could wake up without shoes. I'll remember that. Listen, would you like to have dinner with me tonight? I have plans tonight. How about tomorrow? Sounds great. Well, where does this go? You look strong. Why don't you grab one of the boxes. Yeah, I'll get this one. So this is Brooklyn? Listen up. There's only one dress in each size. So when they open those doors, fan out. This is what you're looking for. Memorize it. When you locate the dress, blow on these, all right? Three sharp blasts. When you hear it, come running. Here he comes! - They're pushing! - Don't be a baby! - Out of the way! - Let's go! Rachel?! Come on! No, not it. Not it. Not it. Don't crowd me. This is it! This is the dress! It's perfect! I'm sorry, this one's taken! - Megan! - Monica! - You came! - Yeah! - This is my dress! - No! - You saw me wearing it. - And now you'll see me buying it. You freak! You wouldn't even know about this place without me. - Look, you don't want to fight me. - Maybe I do. I'm pretty feisty! - I'm coming! I'm coming! - Hey! Okay! Hey? Oh, what do I do?! What are you doing? Did you find the dress? Did you find the dress? No. You gotta get me out of here. - We've gotta get Monica. - You hold my hand! Excuse me! Excuse me! Go! Go! Go! How was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with every flush? Laugh all you want, but she said she'd like to go out again. In fact, I'll go call her right now. And I'll make sure and tell her my friend Chandler says... . Sorry I didn't stop by last night, but I had a date. When it's 1:00 in the morning and you don't come by, that's okay. It was with this really hot girl who moved in across the street. - Right across the street? - Yeah. - When did you meet her? - Two days ago. Excellent! You know, Ross met somebody too. - Hey. - How'd it go? We're going out again Saturday. But I found out she's also seeing some other guy. Really? Joe, what would you do if you were in Ross' situation? I am. I'm dating this girl who's also seeing another guy. But I'm not worried about it. You shouldn't be. I wouldn't want to be the guy who's up against you. I mean, that doofus is going to lose. So this is nice. I wish I didn't have to go. Believe me. But I have to. So, what's the name of the girl you're dating? - Kristen Leigh. - Bye. Well, only one of us can keep dating her. Obviously. So how do we decide? Well, now, let's look at this objectively. I think I should date her. Or I'm the one who dates her. That's interesting. But check this out. I date her. Okay, but to go in another direction... Okay. This can go on for a while. - We should order some food then. - No, Joey. Look, why don't we just let her decide, okay? We'll each go out with her one more time. And we'll see who she likes best. That sounds fair. Maybe I'll take her to that new French restaurant. Wait a second. We have to set a spending limit. I can't take her to a fancy place like that. Well, sorry. That's what I do on dates. Well, I guess I'll just have to do what I do on dates. - So let's decide on a spending limit. - Yeah. And a slice... ...six dollars? - I was thinking more like 100. - Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars? I know. Can you hand me a tissue? You're out of Diet Coke. Hello? What? You what? You listen here, missy! Megan booked The Swing Kings on the day of our wedding... ...and said she'd only give them back for the dress! Does that mean Carcass is available? What am I gonna do? That's the dress! That is ""the"" dress! Chandler wants the band. What do I do? - Figure out how to talk him out of it. - How? You're out of toilet paper! I wanted to wish you good luck on your date. - Thanks. - What time are you meeting? We have reservations at Grand Merci Bistro at 8. That's in 20 minutes. You'd better get dressed. - I am dressed. - Oh, well, good. For me. What's this? Did you give yourself a facial? I have an oily T-zone. Okay, dude. - You sent Kristen flowers? - That's right. You spent 100 dollars. That's the limit. You're screwed! I sent the flowers before the actual date, so technically... ...I didn't break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though. That's how it's gonna be? I can break the rules too. - What are you gonna do? - I don't know. - I'm not surprised. - You won't get away with this. - You don't have much choice. - We'll see! Hey! So, just a light layer? Yeah, just here and there. Joey got meat sauce on the banister again. Swing music is so out. He's gotta be in the room for that to work. What are you guys talking about? We're talking about The Swing Kings... ...and whether they're the right way to go. I went to a wedding where they had swing music... ...two months later the couple divorced. I'm not saying there's any connection here... ...but they did say that's why they got divorced. But I love swing music! But The Swing Kings? They suck so much that people die at their concerts. They stop living. When Monica and I went to see them, we had fun. And there's another reason. - Well, what is the other reason? - I don't want to say. Well, you have to, because maybe it's stupid. It's just, while Monica and I were dancing to them... ...it was the first time I knew that... ...you were the woman that I wanted to dance all my dances with. Oh, crap. - Our table will be ready soon. - Oh, great. - Is your back feeling better? - That's fine. I guess the more muscles you have... ...the more they can spasm out of control. - Kristen? - Joey! - What are you doing here? - I like this place. And technically, I'm not breaking any rules, so... . Well, Ross, this is Joey. Joey, Ross. - Hi. - Hi. It's nice to meet you. I used to have a friend named Joey. I don't anymore. Our table will be ready in a couple minutes. Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks! So, Joey, you look familiar. Are you on TV or something? He doesn't like to talk about it... ...but he's one of the stars of <i>Days of Our Lives. </i> That's right. Don't you play a woman? A woman in a man's body. Much better. It's funny, because you look familiar to me too. Have you ever been married? Yes, I have. In fact, just the other day... ...Kris and I talked about how I've been married and have a son. - Little Eric. - That's right. Wait. No, Ben. So you've just been married the one time then? - Well... . - You've been married twice? Yes. And... ...another time after that. Boy, I'm getting hungry. Have you ever been so hungry on a date... ...that when the girl goes to the bathroom, you eat her food? You said the waiter ate my crab cake. So, Ross, now why did that first marriage break up? Was it because the woman was straight or because she was a lesbian? - Do you two know each other? - No. But he seems like a guy who'd marry a woman... ...on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge. Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea? Have you ever slept in the same bed with a monkey? You leave Marcel out of this! Fine! You ever gotten stuck in a pair of leather pants? Have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet, VD-boy? Monkey-lover! Where do you think we lost her? Probably around gonorrhea. - Hi, honey, I'm home! - Don't come in here! Why, do you have another boyfriend in there? No. We only mess around at his place. I started it, but now it's scaring me, so could you come out here? I'm wearing a wedding dress. You got a wedding dress? - Yeah, but I'm not keeping it. - Then why can't I see it? Oh. I guess you can. But I have to return it, so you can't like it. Okay, I promise. I'll hate it. Wow. You look hideous. Really? Yeah. That's like the most ugliest dress I've ever seen. Why do you have to return it? Because it doesn't really fit. Oh, I booked The Swing Kings. Oh, that's great. Thanks. But that dress is terrible. - It makes me want to rip it off you. - Okay. But you can't rip it. Well, maybe a little. Guys, you want to look at the song list for the wedding? Guys? I thought you'd be gone all day. All right, what's going on? I'm sorry. I should probably leave you girls alone. Laugh all you want, but in 10 minutes we'll have younger-looking skin. You know, she could use a little... . Oh, nice shot! Yeah! <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"

The One With Joey's Award English Subtitles by SDI Media Group Ernest Muhlbrat hypothesized that the velociraptor, when threatened... ...would expand its collar and emit a high-pitched noise... ...to frighten off predators. Mr. Lewis? What kind of noise? Just a high-pitched, intimidating noise. But like how? Well, we don't know for sure. But in my head, it sounded something like this: Of course, this is just conjecture. Okay. That's all for today. Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment? Yes, sir? I need to talk to you about your midterm exam. - I'm afraid I had to fail you. - Why? Well, you need 60% to pass. - What did I get? - Seven. That's not so good. No, no, it's not. What happened, Ned? Maybe you can cut me some slack. I'm sort of in love. I'm sorry, but that's really not my problem. I'm in love with you. That brings me in the loop a little. That's why I did so bad on this test. I'm having a hard time concentrating. When you're up there and you're teaching... ...and your face gets all serious... . You look so good. When you wear that tight little turtleneck sweater... I'm your teacher. I'm sorry. You're a student. And I like women. In spite of what may be written on the backs of these chairs. That guy at the counter's totally checking you out. Really? - Oh, my God, he's really cute! - Go for it. Phoebe, I'm engaged. I'm saying, get his number, just in case. But if Chandler's in an accident and can't perform sexually... ...he'd want you to take a lover to satisfy needs he'd no longer fulfill. Can I just tell you something? I'm very flattered, but I'm engaged. This is kind of embarrassing. I actually came over to talk to your friend. You should be embarrassed. - I thought you knew I looked at you. - I did, but that was really fun. ""The winner is... Joey Tribbiani! "" ""I honestly never expected this. I didn't prepare a speech.

Maybe you don't tell anyone about this? No big deal. I do that with my shampoo bottle. - Really? - Yeah. - What award are you practicing for? - Grammy. For Best New Artist. The Soapies people called today. I also get to present an award. So you'll get on stage even if you don't win. - You don't think I'll win? - Of course I do. But Favorite Returning Character? That's a tough category. You're up against the guy who survived his own cremation. No, I know I might not win. But it's just... . I've never been nominated. I want it so much. You'll probably get it. But you should start practicing your ""gracious-loser"" face. When the cameras are on you, you want to look disappointed. But also that your colleague deserved to win. Like: You know? - You practice losing the Grammys too? - No, at the Grammys, I always win. - Hey! - How'd your date go with Jake? Great. We couldn't keep our eyes off each other. Every once in a while, he'd lean over, stroke my hair, then touch my neck. Stop it. You're getting me all tingly. All I could think of was, is he gonna kiss me? - Did he? - I'm a lady. I don't kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself. Okay, I got it. I got it. I like him so much, I feel like I've had 10 drinks today. I've only had six. I haven't had that feeling since I first went out with Chandler. - I'll never have that feeling again. - You sound like a guy. No, a guy would say, ""I'll never get to sleep with anyone else. "" I'll never sleep with anyone else! I'm so busy planning the wedding, I forgot about what I'll give up. I'll never have a first kiss again. You'll have a last kiss. Can I ask you something?

There's a guy in one of my classes who has a crush on me. - Really? - Yeah. Last year, Elizabeth, now this kid... . What is it? Am I giving out some kind of... ...sexy-professor vibe? Not right now. The point is, my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm. Now I feel bad for the kid. I had a crush on a teacher once, and it was so hard. I couldn't concentrate. I blushed every time he looked at me. You remember what it's like to be 19 and in love. - I can cut him some slack. - Yeah. - How'd you get over that teacher? - I didn't. I got under him. Problem solved. - Bye, Phoebe. - Okay, bye. - All right. Bye. - Bye. We said goodbye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love. It's okay. You don't have to tiptoe around me. I've thought about it. You know what? I'm okay, not having that new-relationship feeling. - I miss you already! - I miss you too! That's great, but I wouldn't trade what I have for that. I'll be with Chandler the rest of my life. That makes me happy. Come sit down. We're talking about how our relationship's deep... ...and meaningful. It is, don't you think? Oh, totally. Pull my finger. - Favorite Returning Male... - This is my category! - Got your speech? - Got my speech. Got your gracious-loser face? Try to remember, if you win, you have to hug me.

Oh, my God. You stole her award! No, no, no. I'm accepting it on her behalf. I don't think you know what ""behalf"" means. Sure I do. It's a verb. As in ""I be half-in' it""! - You've got to take this back. - I should've won. I really wanted it. She didn't care enough to come to the thing. It could also be a Grammy. No, Joey. No one saw me take it. There's a whole table of them. Do you want an award you didn't win? No, I want an award I did win. But nobody's given me any of those! If I put it up, when people come over, they'll see it... ...and think I won it. Joey, it says ""Best Supporting Actress. "" I can scratch that right off. This is wrong. You have to take it back. You don't want to win an award this way. You're very talented. Someday you'll win one of these for real and that one will mean something. - Oh, all right. - All right? Thank you. I'll take it back tomorrow. If I can't have it, you can't have it! - Professor Geller? - Yes, Mr. Lewis? How can I help you? I know I didn't do well on my midterms and stuff. But I was hoping you could change my grade. And why, exactly, would I do that? Because I'm in love with you. What? Yeah. I'm all in love with you and stuff. - So could you change my grade? - No! Why not? You changed Ned's grade. That's different. Because he was actually in love with me. No, he's not! He's totally yanking your chain. He's done this with three other teachers. - What? - He's got a girlfriend. I can't believe someone would do that for a grade. I know. It's awful. I love you. - Have you seen Chandler? - No, why? I keep thinking about all the things I won't have. It's freaking me out. I don't know what to do. Don't sweat it. Chandler's not around, so get it out of your system. That guy's cute. Come on, I'm serious. - I've got to talk to him about this. - That's the last thing you want to do. - Why? - Because you're marrying him! You gotta help me out here. I've never been engaged. I've never really been married. I can only tell you what my mother told me. When you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship... ...don't communicate them to your husband. I'm not supposed to share my doubts and fears... ...with the guy I'm spending the rest of my life with? That is correct. Yes. You're supposed to put all that stuff in a little box in your mind... ...and lock it up. Your mother told you this? The woman who married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13? Oh, my God, you're right. Tell Chandler. Hurry, before it's too late! Wait! Does this also mean that putting out doesn't get you love? - I'm gonna meet Jessica Ashley! - Wait, wait. Rach, please be cool, okay? I work with this woman. Okay, I'm totally cool. Come in. Hey, Jessica. Hey, Jess. This is my friend Rachel. - Hi. - What's up? Here's your Soapie. I accepted it for you. Oh, my God. I won? Do you have any idea what this means? You're not gonna put it on your shelf or anything? No, I try to save that for real awards. Now if you'll excuse me? - Take it back? - Absolutely. Yeah, you do! Honey? As we get closer to the wedding... ...is there anything you'd like to share? Okay. I think the centerpieces are too big. You're wrong. The centerpieces are fine. - Do you ever get scared at all? - Kind of. They're really big. Doesn't it freak you out that you'll never be with anybody new again? What? I love you so much. Sometimes it bothers me that I'll never have that feeling. When you first meet someone... ...and it's new and exciting. You know that rush? No, when I first meet somebody... ...it's mostly panic, anxiety and a great deal of sweating. Okay. But you're a guy. Aren't you freaked out that you'll never sleep with anybody else? Sleeping with somebody, no. Anxiety, panic and, I'm afraid, even more sweating. Even with me? I was dangerously dehydrated the first six months of our relationship. For me, the rush is knowing that we'll be together the rest of our lives. - Really? - Well, yeah. Knowing you're having these thoughts, we're back to panic, anxiety and... ...I'll definitely need some kind of sports drink. Come here. Oh, you don't have to worry. Besides, you know what? I'll have a lot of new things with you. The first time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid. Water. Water. Water. Mr. Morse? Can I speak to you for a moment? That was a great lecture today. Did you get a little haircut? Yeah, yeah. Do you like it? Do you love it? I want you to know I'm changing your grade back. What? Why? I know what you're trying to pull here. It won't work. I'm not trying to pull anything. Look, I love you, dude. I'm not even gonna talk about this. This little ""thing"" is over. I know you have a girlfriend. And I know about the other professors. How do you think that makes me feel? You used me! You don't love me and you never did! Professor Winston. Professor Frederickson. I'll be right with you. Don't make this worse and I'll give you a ""C. "" Shall we? I'll be out in a second. ""It's just so unexpected!

719,"Oh, hey! How was your audition? I'm sorry, do I know you? What are you doing? Practicing blowing you off. I'm gonna be a big movie star! You got it? - Not yet, but the audition went great! - What's it for? A big-budget period movie about three Italian brothers... ...who come to America at the turn of the century. It's classy. The director's supposed to be the next-next Martin Scorsese. The ""next-next""? A guy from Chicago's supposed to be the next Martin Scorsese. This guy's right after him. Hello? Joey, it's Estelle. I just talked to the casting people. They loved you! They loved me! They want to see you again tomorrow. - My God! <i>-There's just one thing. </i> Do you have a problem with full-frontal nudity? Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it! Oh. Okay, let me call you back. - What's the matter? - They want me naked in the movie. - Wow! - I know. - My grandmother's gonna see this. - Grandma's gonna have to get in line. The One With Ross and Monica's Cousin English Subtitles by SDI Media Group The wedding's so close. Are you nervous? Yeah, but I also can't wait till it's over. We have a pact not to have sex again until the wedding. A ""no sex"" pact, huh? I have one of those with every woman in America. Will you give me a hand making up the guest bedroom? Cousin Cassie's staying with us for a few days. Cassie? I haven't seen her in, like, forever. I wonder if she still carries a Barbie everywhere? - She's 25 years old. - So? I still... You're probably right. Pheebs, can I talk to you over here for a second? Subtle, guys. What? I know you're planning my surprise bridal shower. Okay, well, don't ruin it. Just play along, at least. Okay. Sorry. We have to throw her a shower? What'd you decide to do about the movie? I don't know. It's not like it's porn. This is a serious, legitimate movie. Nudity's really important to the story. That's what you say about porn. Maybe I shouldn't go on the callback. No, you should. A lot of major actors do nude scenes. The chance to star in a movie? Come on! That's true. And I'm only naked in one scene. It sounds really great. My character's Catholic. He falls in love with a Jewish girl. We run away and get caught in a big rainstorm. We go into a barn, undress each other and hold each other. It's really sweet and tender. Plus, everyone will see your thing! When can we have this shower? She has so much going on, we have only two options. - We have Friday. - That's just two days away. - What is the other option? - Yesterday. If we make it yesterday, we're done! It's impossible. We can't do this by Friday. We have to find a place, invite people, get food. There's too much to do. - We cannot do it! - Calm down! Okay. I'm sorry, you're right. I'm sorry. Just calm down, woman! Phoebe, I already did. All right, then I need to calm down. I think we can do this if we just get organized. We have two days to plan this party. We need to make fast decisions. Where will we have it? - Here. What time? - 4:00. Food? - Finger sandwiches and tea. - Great! Very Monica. - And chili! - You went one too far. - Flowers or balloons? - Both. - We're paying for this. - Neither. - What should we do for a theme? - Lusts of the Flesh! - What? - I don't know. Cowboy theme? I'm glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding. Oh, boy. Me too. I was thinking, say we had a big fight, and broke up for a few hours. Technically, we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering? The wedding's off, sloppy and immature. That's me. Come on. Wait. Cassie's in the guest room. We're going to lunch. Get rid of her, obsessive and shrill! Shrill? The wedding is back on. I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler. - Hi. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. - So, ready to go? - Yeah. - Chandler? - I'll be right with you. - Cassie needs to stay at your place. - Why? Because ""Pervie Perverson"" here can't stop staring at her. Chandler, she's our cousin! I wasn't staring. I was listening intently. It's called being a good conversationalist. Watch. Say something. You were staring about eight inches south of there. Fine. She can stay at my place. What does Cassie look like now? Exactly like Aunt Marilyn. This Aunt Marilyn, is she coming to the wedding? Wafer-thin ice. Hey, I'm back. Hi, Joey. Will I read the same scene again? I tried to call you. You didn't need to come today. Oh, great. I'd have been perfect for this part. You made a bad decision and ruined your movie. Good day! You didn't need to come, because the director saw your tape and loved it. End scene. Wasn't that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah! So, you were saying? The director wants to meet you tomorrow. Wow! Sure! That's great. Your agent said you're okay with nudity. Yeah, sure. As long as it's handled tastefully. And that barn is not too cold. Perfect. There's one more thing. It's important to the director that everything in the movie's authentic. In your love scene with Sarah... ...she talks about how she's never seen a naked man who wasn't Jewish. So... . So... what? So, the director is insisting that whoever play that part... ...be authentically, anatomically... ...not Jewish. You know what I'm saying? Yes! No. What? An Italian Catholic immigrant at this time would not be... . Bar mitzvah-ed? - To get this part, you can't be... - No. But you are? - You told them you weren't? - That's right. Wow! It's definitely all gone? There's nothing there to work with? - What were you thinking? - I don't know. I just want this part. They say no matter what you're asked during an audition, say yes. They want you to ride a horse, say you can. You figure out how to do it later. This is not like learning to ride a horse. This is like learning to... ...grow a turtleneck. I know, okay? Tomorrow, when I go meet the director... ...I have to take my clothes off so they can see what my body looks like. Oh, my God. What are you gonna do? I have to call my agent and tell her I can't do the part. Unless... . Unless what? This may sound crazy, but there may be something we could... ...fashion. - Like what? - Well, I'm not sure yet. Off the top of my head, I'm thinking... ...double-sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat. I've got a great idea for party favors for the shower. We get mahogany boxes and carve everyone's names in them. Then inside is each person's individual birthstone. Okay. Okay. You take care of that. Meanwhile, the party's tomorrow and we don't have a guest list. Okay. Who do we know that's coming? Me. Are you? - Hey. - Hey, what's up? I'm making something for Joey. Can I raid your fridge? Have at it. All right. Turkey? That won't work. Cheese? That won't work. Olive loaf? I hope that won't work. Are you making him a sandwich? No, it's more like a wrap. Okay, so I'm gonna go, guys. So you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present! We have to get her a present? Okay, but look. Look at what I got. It's her address book. We have a guest list. You're amazing. Did you pull that out of her purse? Uh-huh. And a little seed money for the party. Cassie? Hey, Ross! It's been so long! Last time I saw you... ...you were setting up your tent in line for <i>Return of the Jedi. </i> So you did see me that day. Because it seemed like you didn't. - Yeah, sorry about that. - It's okay. Come on in. Thanks for letting me stay here. Monica's place was nice. But her fianc sure stares a lot. Oh, my God! You do a great Chandler! I have a knack for impressions. Maybe after we get re-acquainted you could do me. Yeah. No! How you doing on that... ...hot dog? - I'm all done. - Thank God. The last time we hung out was when our parents rented that beach house. Remember the time I pinned you down and tickled you until you cried? We're probably too old to do that now. I'll always remember that summer. It's when I got all these freckles. I'll always remember that summer... ...because that's when I realized that we are related. It took you that long to figure it out? I'm a little slow. Just as our children would be. - Hi. - Hi. How are you? Good. Hi. Thanks for coming. Thank you. So nice to see you. - No, thanks. - Okay. Hey, Rach? - Yeah? - Who the hell are all these people? I don't know. I called everybody in her book. These are the ones that could show up on 24 hours' notice. There's a word for people like that: Losers. Hi, I'm Rachel. This is Phoebe. I'm the maid of honor. - How do you know Monica? - I was her accountant four years ago. I'm interested to find out who's been doing her taxes the last four years. That's great. - When is Monica supposed to get here? - I don't know. Excuse us. - You didn't tell her? - You were supposed to. You were supposed to tell her to come! I was bringing the cake! - Fine, I'll go call her. - And please tell her to bring a cake! We have a lot of options. A number of prototypes for you to try on. Those look great. Okay, this one's a mushroom cap. This one is made of bologna. - The toothpicks? - Just until the glue dries. Thank God. These are more realistic, but perishable. Over here, we have pink suede, which is nice. But if it gets wet, it'll shrink. Maybe we'll just take that one away. I also did a little something in fur, but that's really just for me. Why don't you try these on? We'll get a better idea of what works. Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird. - Toothpick? - Yeah. - What are you trying now? - The Fruit Roll-up. - And? - Delicious. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. We have a winner! What? Which one? The Silly Putty. Not so silly anymore! <i>She's your cousin. </i> <i>She's your cousin. </i> <i>If she knew what was going on in</i> <i>your head, she'd think you were sick. </i> <i>Or would she? </i> <i>Let's back up for a second. </i> <i>She was the one who suggested</i> <i>opening a bottle of wine. </i> <i>She was the one who</i> <i>turned down the lights. </i> <i>She was the one that wanted to rent</i> Logan's Run... <i>... the sexiest movie ever. </i> <i>I know that look. </i> <i>Forget it.

Rachel? It's Monica. I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice? - Oh, Monica. We are so sorry. - For what? First, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower. Then, forgetting to invite you to it. You already had it? We called everyone in your phone book. A bunch of people came. It took us so long to get you here that they had to leave. We wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower. Now you don't have either. We ruined everything. No, wait a minute, that's not true. What you did was really sweet. - It kind of works out for the best. - What do you mean? Now I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love. I get all those presents without talking to people I don't even like! - Surprise. - Surprise, Monica. What's cool is, the character is from Naples, right? My whole family's from Naples. That's great. Okay. I've heard everything I need to hear... . We just need to, uh... . Leslie? - Joey, this is the awkward part. - Hey, right. Not a problem. I totally understand you need to... ...make sure I don't have any horrible scars or tattoos. Don't you worry. I have nothing to hide. So, there you go. That's me. One hundred-percent natural. I tell you, that has never happened before. Cassie, are you finding everything okay? Yeah. Thanks for letting me stay here. Oh, it's no problem. What? <i>Say something.

720,"Out of all of us, who do you think will get married next? Probably Monica and Chandler. Could I have a pack of Newport Lights? We don't sell cigarettes, but they do across the street. That'd be great. Thanks. Melissa Worbert. I don't think I have the energy for this. Oh, my God! Ray-Ray Greene? You've been MIA for seven sorority newsletters. What's up with you? Why don't I tell you over here? So last I heard you were gonna get married. Poor Ray-Ray. Oh, no. It's all good. - I actually work at Ralph Lauren. - Shut up! I will not. I'm the divisional head of men's sportswear. Shut up more! Are you friends with Ralph? - Oh, please. - Are you? No. We have to have dinner. What are you doing tomorrow? - Tomorrow. I don't know. - You're having dinner with me. Shut up. I've gotta go. This has been so great. Oh, there you are. So listen, just call me. Here's my card. - You're in real estate? - No, that's an old card. I got out of that to do something where I could... ...help people and make a difference. What do you do now? I'm a party planner. - I'll see you tomorrow. - Okay. Look who's back. It's Ray-Ray. That was my friend, Melissa, from college. She seems really, really fun! She's actually sweet, and we used to be very close. Wait a minute. She's not the one who you...? Who you what? Who you what? - Yes. - Wow! Wow, what? Who you what? Oh, it's not a big deal. They were lovers. - What? - What? No, we weren't. It was nothing. It was one night, senior year, and we went to a party... ...had a lot of sangria, and you know, ended up... ...kissing for a bit. So that's two of my wives. The One With Rachel's Kisses English Subtitles by SDI Media Group So this is where the band is. And here's the bar. And all these pins have people's names on them. Rach, here you are. Why don't we just put me with a Manhattan in my hand... ...talking to the cute bartender. These pins aren't for playing, are they? The red are my guests, and the blue are yours. This is so sad. I only have like 10 pins. Chandler, relax. It's not a contest. Certainly not a close one. Hey, Rach. Stop picturing it! I think that's it. The seating chart is done. This is our wedding. They all look like they're having fun. So where are my parents gonna be? Well, if this is the wedding hall... ...your parents would be over here at home in Queens. They're not invited? Oh, no, they're gonna be crushed! Why would they think they're invited? You got me. I don't... . - Joey! - Look, I thought parents were coming. Your parents are coming. Chandler's are coming. Ross' parents are coming. Ross' parents are my parents. Well, see, parents are coming. - We should invite them. - You just want more blue pins. Well, this is just sad. All right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. Rachel may have to sit at the bar. That is not a problem. - Maybe you'll order a little sangria. - Get out of here! These are our tuxedos. If you like anything, we can make a deal. Anything at all. But these are the three that Monica pre-approved. Thanks a lot for hooking me up. And I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest. I'm Monica's maid of honor. Okay, don't try to blue-pin me. - Well, these look nice. - They are nice. When celebrities are done with them, they send them back. - You mean like for award shows? - Some of them. They've been down the red carpet with people yelling... ...""Who are you wearing? You look fabulous! "" Might I suggest watching a little more ESPN... ...and a little less E! . Okay. Who wore those? - Well, this one's Tom Brokaw. - Not bad. This one is Paul O'Neil. Who's that? He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN. Just once in a while. Have it on in the background. - This one was Pierce Brosnan. - Pierce Brosnan? Are you serious? 007? This is James Bond's tux? I have to get married in James Bond's tux. It's a pretty cool tux. It's not just that. I would be England's most powerful weapon. A jet-setting heartbreaker on Her Majesty's secret service. A man who fears no one, with a license to kill. Would Monica let me wear this? We should really learn how to play the real way. I like our way. Chess! - Nice move. - Yeah. I hooked Ross and Chandler up with tuxedos. Do you need one? No, I'm not wearing a tux. - What are you gonna wear? - Multi-colored robes. And maybe a hat. - Does Monica know about this? - No. Can I please be there when you tell her? You want to go to a movie tonight? I'm having dinner with Melissa. Can I come? I won't talk. You'll just hear my video camera. - What? What's going on? - Can I tell her? Do you want what happened, or Joey's lewd version? Joey's. I had this college friend... ...and I made the mistake of telling Joey that one time... ...she and l, you know, kissed a little bit. Yeah, I'm sure that happened. - It did. - Sure. Hey. It happened. It was senior year. It was after the Sigma Chi luau... ...and Melissa and I got very drunk. And we ended up kissing. For several minutes. Which means she had a couple spritzers and a peck on the cheek. Why are you taking this away from me? Why is it so hard for you to believe? Okay. I just didn't know that you were a lesbian. I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian. I'm just saying that this happened. It just seems pretty wild. And you're so... ...vanilla. Vanilla? I'm not vanilla. I do lots of crazy things. I mean, I got drunk and married in Vegas. To Ross. If you don't believe me... ...just come with me to dinner tonight and she'll tell you. Okay. Because I can't picture it. You should get inside my head. Guess what I got for your wedding? A freakishly thin date with a hanger for a head? Rachel hooked me up with a tux. But not just any tux. Batman's tux! - What? - That's right. Made expressly for Val Kilmer, and worn by him in the hit film... ...that Batman film he was in. You can't wear that. I'm wearing the famous tux. If you wear that, it'll make mine less special. You need something to to make it special? You have the most special thing of all. You are marrying the woman you love. Don't take away my cool thing. Pretty please? ""Pretty please?"" Not very 007. If you were getting married, I'd never do anything to upset you. - You slept with my sister. - That was pretty 007. All right, I figured it out. I'm gonna take 2 tables of 8, add your parents... ...and make them into 3 tables of 6. And I called the caterer. We are good to go! Yeah. They're not coming. What? They think that you only invited them because of me. They feel unwanted. That's too bad. It's true. But too bad. If you could just call my mom. Just let her know you want them there. This is a woman who has sent you many lasagnas. No, she hasn't. Is it her fault if some didn't make it to you? What am I gonna say? Tell them you mixed up invitations. No, blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish. But I don't think you could blame it on them. Hello? Yeah, hi. Mrs. Tribbianni? This is Monica Geller. I'm just calling to say that I really hope you can make the wedding. Apparently some of our invitations weren't delivered. I guess there was some screw-up at the damn post office. Tell me about it! Yeah, the U.S. Post Office? No. More like U.S. Lost Office. What are they, Irish? Anyway, his name's Allen. And we've been going out for three years. He was my first client when I became a party planner. He was actually planning a party for his girlfriend at the time. Oh, well. - He was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse. - That's great. - Were you ever in a sorority? - Of course. Yes. I was a Thigh Mega Tampon. What one? We were huge too. But they had to shut us down... ...when Regina Phalangie died of alcohol poisoning. Isn't it a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch? Anyway... . Speaking of drinking too much, I told Phoebe... ...about that crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where we made out. What? Remember we... Come on, we had sarongs on and the coconut bikini tops. We went back to the house and got really silly... ...and we made out. Wow, Ray-Ray, I have no idea what you're talking about. Really? Ross is Batman. Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time. Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in <i>Batman.</i> Batman is so much cooler than James Bond. - What? 007 has all those gadgets. - Batman has a utility belt. - 007 has a fancy car. - Batman has the Batmobile. - 007 gets all the ladies. - Batman has Robin. We get ESPN, right? How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo, and I'll make you a martini? I don't like martinis. - A Yoo-Hoo with a funny straw? - Yum. I know the invitation says 6 p.m. But does that mean get there at 6, or the show starts at 6? The show? Right, the wedding. Gotcha. But weddings start a little late, right? Have you ever been to one of my weddings? Well, it's the same day as my niece's christening... ...and I want my parents to see me. My part's in the beginning. I'm not in the rest of the show... Wedding. The wedding starts at 6. Okay. I totally hear you. How about this? I vamp till they get there. You'll ""vamp""? Like warm up the crowd. Ask where they're from. In Joey Tribbianni, you get a minister and an entertainer. I'm a ""ministainer."" There's no one better. There's no one greater. How can you not remember us kissing? I don't know. I don't remember a lot of things that never happened. Remember, we were on the sleeping porch? We couldn't stop giggling. Our coconuts kept knocking together. Somewhere Joey's head is exploding. I don't want to make you uncomfortable... ...but I told Phoebe it happened, and she doesn't believe me. I'm sorry. I mean, if I thought it happened, I would say it. Maybe I passed out and you did stuff to me while I was sleeping. It's okay, you don't have to do this. I believe you. If you say you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa. - Thank you, Phoebe. - Okay. - But she didn't. - I know. You carry that around? I find it to be something of a conversation piece. - Between you and...? - Gunther. Why don't we put them on? Get a picture of Batman and James Bond, together. I would, but my pants are a little tight. A little tight? I could see 00 and 7 in those things. I was looking forward to wearing our celebrity tuxes together. - So you're not gonna be wearing yours? - Are you kidding? It's Batman's tux! Let me try it on. Okay. But just the jacket. 00 and 7 are not getting in there. Holy double-vented comfort, Batman! What's this? An invitation to the <i>At First Sight</i> premiere? Val Kilmer didn't wear this in <i>Batman. </i> He wore it to the premiere of a fruity love story where he was a blind guy. Let me see that. Oh, man. The only super power you have is the slightly heightened sense of smell. Can I talk to you guys for a second? I give up. Whatever you want, you can have it. You want to sing a song or do a dance? You want your mom at the altar screaming racial slurs? I don't care. I just want to thank you guys for what you did for my parents. They're so happy to be a part of your special day. Tell them we're glad they're coming. I will. Oh, check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony! I wear it like this when I marry you guys. And then this... ...is for party time. It happened. I am telling you it happened. It was great meeting you. And, Rachel? I don't think I'll be calling you because... ...you know, you've gotten weird. Take care, you guys. Wait a minute. Okay, look. That night was the one wild thing I've ever done in my life. I won't let you take it away. So if you don't remember that, maybe you'll remember this... . Oh, my God. You love me. What? Of course I remember. I think about it all the time. I can still hear the coconuts knocking together... . I didn't want to tell you, because I didn't think you'd return my love... . Look who's being suddenly shy. You have to feel what I feel. Nobody can kiss that good and not mean it. I'm just a good kisser. Shut up. I'm sorry. You don't have to be sorry. I'm obviously kidding. I'm not in love with you. I'm not in love with her. I don't hear coconuts banging together. I don't picture your face when I make love to my boyfriend. Anyway, I gotta go. A kiss goodbye? No? Okay. I mean, I had no idea that that would... . What the hell was that? Just wanted to see what all the fuss was about. - And? - I've had better. I found one that fits.

There are no words! This shouldn't be this hard! You've done this before. What did you say in your vows? With Carol I promised never to love another woman until I die. She made no such promise. I'm pathetic. Monica knows what to say, you should have seen her. What's the emergency? You have to help me write my vows. All I have is this. I like the pretty drawing of you in the wedding dress. - Thank you. - Except your breasts look small. Those are my eyes! - Those are my breasts. - Oh, yeah. Why don't you start with something simple? ""Monica, from the moment I met you I knew I loved you. "" I can't do that. Everyone, this is Chandler. Hi, I'm Ross' little sister. Okay. Okay, okay. Maybe you could start with: ""Chandler, even though we were friends... ...there was a part of me that knew I wanted more. "" All right, there's a nuclear holocaust. I'm the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me? Are we allowed to lie in the vows? Okay, don't talk about those feelings. Just say something about... ...all the things he's taught you, like... Or all the things you taught him. Everybody knows the erogenous zones. One, two, three... ...four, five, six and seven. There are seven? - That's one? - Kind of an important one. I was looking at it upside down. You know, sometimes that helps. Okay, start out with a little one... ...a two, a one-two-three... ...a three, a five... ...a four, a three-two... ...two, a two-four-six. Two-four-six, four, two... ...two, four-seven... ...five-seven, six-seven... ...seven, seven... ...seven, seven, seven... ...seven! How about something like: ""Monica, when I look back over our time together... . "" - Yeah? - I can't do all of it. Look back over your time together. Oh, look, twins! No fair! I don't even have one, how come they get two? - You'll get one. - Yeah, when? When we're 40, if neither of us are married... ...what do you say we have one? - Why wouldn't I be married? I just meant hypothetically. Hypothetically, why won't I be married? No, no. What is it? Is there something unmarriable about me? Well? Dear God, this parachute is a knapsack! I'm getting married today! Think he knew I was here? Nice try. Wait, wait, wait. Look, Monica... - This is not gonna work. - I bet this'll work. You are so great! I love you. What? I said you're so great, and then I stopped talking. - You said you love me! - No, I didn't. - Yes, you did. - No, I didn't! - You love me! - No, I don't! Stop it! Stop it! You know, I was thinking, what if I unpack here? Then all your stuff would be here. Well... . What if it was here? Then you'd be going back and forth all the time. Doesn't make any sense. Okay. What if we live together, and you understand what I'm saying? We wanted to surprise you. Oh, my God! Chandler... ...in all my life... ...I never thought I'd be so lucky... ...as to fall in love with my best... My best... There's a reason why girls don't do this! Okay, okay, okay! I'll do it.

You make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you let me... ...I'll spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica? Will you marry me? Yes. Can we come in? We're dying out here! Come in! Come in! - We're engaged! - Yes! - Hi. - What have you guys been up to? Helping Chandler write his vows. He kicked us out. Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions. How is ""Monica, I love your sweet ass"" inappropriate? How's Monica doing? Lucky she's got a sweet ass. She's not so good at writing. In four weeks they're gonna be married! Let's just hope it works. Nine out of 10 marriages end in divorce. That's not true. You're right. How's the missis? I can't believe... ...they're together 3 years. - That long? It seems like less because they hid it from us. Hey, it's me. Coming in. I've had a very long, hard day. - I'm getting some chicken. Want some? - No. Bye, then. He wouldn't leave. He kept asking if I wanted chicken. Chicken? I could eat some chicken. Hey, Joe! Can I get a three-piece, coleslaw, beans and a Coke? Diet Coke. - Why didn't they tell us? - I know, we were cool about it. You? And you? You cannot tell. No one knows. How? When? - It happened in London. - In London?!

Get in here! Come on! So they don't know that Rachel knows? Yes, but it doesn't matter who knows what. Enough of us know. We can just tell them we know. The lying and the secrets will be over. Or, we can not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own. We better go if we're gonna catch that movie. - Bye. - Bye. Bye, Chandler. I miss you already. Did you see the inappropriate pinching? Actually, I did. So now do you believe that she's attracted to me? Oh, my God! My God, she knows about us! - Phoebe knows about us! - I didn't tell them. Them? Who's them? Phoebe and Joey. Joey! And Rachel. They made me promise not to tell. They think they are so slick, messing with us! They don't know that we know that they know. - So... . - Ah, yes!

Do they know that we know? - No. - Joey! - They know you know. - I knew it! I cannot believe those two! They thought that they could mess with us? With us? They don't know that we know they know we know. Joey, you can't say anything. Couldn't if I wanted to. She wants me to put lotion on her! She's bluffing! She's not backing down. She went like this. He's not backing down. He went to get lotion. Aren't you guys done yet? The sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over. - I like that. - Okay. Okay, show him your bra. He's afraid of bras. Can't work them. Wow! You didn't rip off any buttons. It's not my first time. You go seduce her until she cracks. Okay, give me a second. - Did you clean up in here? - Of course. Oh, you're going? Not without you, lover. So, this is my bra. It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm happy we're gonna have all the sex. You should be. I'm very bendy. - I'm gonna kiss you. - Not if I kiss you first. There's nothing left for us to do but kiss. Here it comes. Our first kiss. - Okay, okay, okay, fine, you win! - Ha! - I can't have sex. - Why not? - I'm in love with Monica. - You're what? Love her! That's right, I love her! I love her! I love you, Monica. I love you too, Chandler. I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love. That's it, it's over. Everybody knows. - Well, Ross doesn't. - We'd like it if no one told him yet. No. What are you doing? Get off my sister! Friends getting married, it's gotta change things. Think it'll be different? How can it not be? They're gonna have kids... ...and hang out with other couples who have kids. And maybe they'll leave the city... ...to be near a Volvo dealership. Things change. I don't want them to move to a Volvo dealership. It'll be okay, Joe. Sorry. I just... I like things the way they are. Who's this little naked guy? That naked guy would be me.

No, that would be me again. - Hey, you guys. - What's going on? Well, we were just talking about... ...you guys getting married and how great it is. Yeah, you can get a Volvo. If that's what you really want. That's so sweet. - So, we both finished our vows. - Can we read them? As long as I don't hear his and he doesn't hear mine. Oh, that's beautiful. Funny one! Good! Will you marry me? What? I don't get it. Oh, yeah! - Man, this is hilarious! - Chandler! Don't worry, we'll make yours funnier. Okay, what do you think? - Dude... . - I have never known love like this. - You really like it? - Dude! How did you write this?

722,"- Hey. - Hey. I saw the Porsche parked out front. Can I get the keys? I'll take that bad boy for a spin. Ross drives it? When I ask, you say you're the only one allowed to. He's my brother, plus he drives so slow he couldn't hurt it. It's a car, Monica, not a rocket ship. Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you're done. - Hey. - Hi. Saw the Porsche. Looking good. When can I take it out again? - You let Joey drive it? - I've never driven it. Not once. Okay, once. Okay, I drive it all the time. So much for the ""you-can-drive-it but-don't-tell-Rachel"" plan. Wow, I can't believe you lied to me. I can fix this. Monica, Rachel thinks all you talk about is the wedding. I won't let you drive the Porsche because you're a terrible driver. There. That wasn't about the wedding. If you want a ride in the Porsche, I'll take you around the block. You got a couple hours? The One With Chandler's Dad English Subtitles by SDI Media Group Whew, that was a brisk ride. - Take the top down, did you? - Only way to fly. Give me the keys. Monica's wrong. I'm an excellent driver. You're fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver. In high school, that added up to head cheerleader. Did you see how she looked at me? She must've seen me cruising in the bad boy. - She's checking out your beehive. - What? - Give me a brush. - The keys. - No way! - Well, no brush. Fine. It doesn't matter. If I remember correctly, there's a comb on the floor of the bathroom. Alimony. We still haven't gotten an RSVP from your dad. Oh, right. Maybe that's because I didn't send him an invitation. He's your father. He should be at our wedding. I don't even know him. I haven't seen him in years. And when he finds out he wasn't asked? We don't run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys and he... ...stars in a drag show in Vegas. I think I want to trade circles. You don't want him there. Nobody will stare at the bride... ...when the groom's father's wearing a backless dress. As long as he's not wearing a white dress and veil, I don't care. I think I need to do some shopping. Nice. My God! - What do you think you're doing? - Just washing the windshield. There's no way I'll let you drive this car. Just hand over the keys. Oh! Do not start this car. Okay, okay. I will give you 20 bucks... ...if you get out of this car right now. Hey! Look. If you're so freaked out, get in the car. With you? Yeah, right. All right. Okay, okay, okay. - What are you doing? Get in front. - In the death seat?! - Hey, guys. - Hi, sweetie. - Ready to go? - My purse is at Mon's. I'll be back. - Wait a minute. - What? Oh. That one kept going. So, you and Phoebe, huh? - How long have you been going out? - A month. We ought to get to know each other better. - Sure. I'd like that. - Yeah. So, uh... . What's your name? - It's Jake. - Joey. - Do you like the Knicks? - Yeah, big fan. Me too. There's a game Tuesday. Do you want to go? Great! Let me make sure I'm not doing anything Tuesday. Here. - What's this? - Your suitcase. We're going to Vegas. Are you serious? Eloping? No more stupid wedding stuff. No more these flowers, these flowers. Think of the money we'll save. We're not eloping. Can our wedding be bigger, please? We're going to see your dad. I want to get to know my father-in-law. When we went over this, I won. No, you didn't. Honey, just so you know... . Now that you're marrying me, you don't get to win anymore. Forget it. I don't want to go. I don't want to see him. I know your dad embarrassed you. All kids are embarrassed by their parents. You need a new word for what I went through. In high school, he came to all my swim meets... ...dressed as a Hollywood starlet. Hard enough to be 14, skinny, wearing Speedos Mom promised I'd grow into. You look up in the stands. There's your dad cheering you on. Dressed as Carmen Miranda, wearing a headdress with real fruit... ...that he'll later give to your friends as a healthy snack. He was at every one of your swim meets cheering you on. That's a pretty great dad. He had sex with Mr. Garibaldi. - Who's Mr. Garibaldi? - Does it matter?! You're not 14 anymore, okay? Maybe it's time you let that stuff go. If he's not at your wedding, you'll regret it for the rest of your life. Okay, but I'm just doing this for you. - I never get to win anymore? - How much did you ever win before? You know how when you're wearing pants and you lean forward... ...I check out your underwear? Well, when Jake did it... ...I saw that he was wearing women's underwear. I know. They were mine. Oh! No, no, wait. That's weird. We were goofing around, and I dared him to try them on. That's weird! - I'm wearing his briefs right now. - That's kind of hot. I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick. I wouldn't know about that. Jake says that women's underwear is actually more comfortable. He loves how silk feels against his skin. Next he'll say your high heels are good for his posture. There's nothing wrong with Jake. He is all man. I think more than you. He looked like a real lumberjack in those pink lacies. Only a man completely secure in his masculinity could... ...walk around in women's underwear. I don't think you could. - I am secure with my masculinity. - Okay, whatever. You've seen my huge stack of porn. God, I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my license renewed. You don't have a valid driver's license? Pull over right now. You're so tense. You just gotta relax, okay? Okay? Just need to relax. All right? Just need to relax. What are you...? That's not funny. Stop horsing around. I am not horsing around, okay? I am ""Porsche-ing"" around. Uh-oh. Stay calm. Nothing will happen. You're not in that much trouble. Really? You think so? I'm talking to myself. You're going down! Has someone taken your order? Oh, yeah. She did. He did. She? I'm sorry, I'm new. I don't... . - I just ordered a beer. - You're straight. I get it. If we called your dad, we'd have better seats. I don't want him to know we're here yet. I'm not ready. He won't be too happy to see me either. Why not? He's kind of tried to contact me... ...a lot the last few years. - What? Yeah. He's made phone calls, written letters. He came to New York. I said I was too busy. It's very ""Cats in the Cradle. "" I don't want to get into it. Here we go. <i>Ladies and gentlemen, </i> <i>welcome the incomparable... </i> <i>... Helena Handbasket. </i> Hello, darlings. And there's Daddy. Switch places with me. Come on!

Oh, my God. - Can I see your license, please? - Absolutely. It's weird. I had a dream last night that I was stopped by a policeman. And then he... . Well, I probably shouldn't tell you the rest. - Your license. - Yes. Here you go, Officer... ...Handsome. - It's Hanson. - Oops, sorry. My mistake. Dear Lord! - Wow! - Here it comes. This is a great picture. Really? You think so? You know, I had just rolled right out of bed. You look phenomenal. She should! It was taken 10 years ago! You know, you probably... ...wonder about the old date. Yes. You're an Aquarius, huh? - I'll bet you're a Gemini. - No. - Taurus? - No. - Virgo? - No. - Sagittarius? - Yep. I knew it. I knew it! You won't speed anymore, right? I won't speed. - Promise to take care of this? - I promise. Let him drive. Does he have a license? - Can he handle a stick? - Well... . I can handle a stick! - That can't be your father. - I've been saying that for years. - Oh, my God! - What? That's Mr. Garibaldi playing the piano. Hello, and welcome to the show. I see some of our regulars in the audience. And a couple of irregulars. - He's coming into the audience. - Relax. You'll be fine. Oh, much better. You're invisible now. - Where are you from? - Bakersfield. - I'm sorry? - Bakersfield. No, no, I heard. I'm just sorry. I'll meet you back at the hotel. Look, a standing ovation already. So early in the show. Turn around, darling. Let me see your pretty face. Can we have our drinks, please? Waiter? ...tress? - Hey, Pheebs. - Hey. Check it out. How much of a man am I? Wow, nice. Manly, and also kind of a slut. I'm beginning to see what Jake was talking about. The silk feels really good. And things aren't as smashed down as I thought they would be. That's great. You have so many more choices than with men's underwear. Bikini, French cut, thong. And the fabrics: cotton, silk, lace. You know what I've always wondered about? Pantyhose! The way they start at your toe, then they go all the way up to... - I should go take these off. - I think it's important you do. What's your name? Chandler. Chandler? What an unusual name. You must have had terribly fascinating parents. Oh, they're a hoot. And who is your friend? I'm Monica. - Monica. Where are you from? - New York. I'm not very fond of New York. Queens, I like. What is this... ...sparkling something, honey, huh? Actually, Monica and I are engaged. Really? Congratulations. When's the big day? In two weeks. I see. Well, I wish you both a lifetime of happiness. So, you're bald. Wait, wait. We'd love it if you could be there. Really? I know it would make me happy... ...ma'am. Then I wouldn't miss it for the world. I'm getting all misty here. You'd think I was having my legs waxed or something. - You okay? - Yeah. Thanks for making me do this. Before we go on with the show, I want to say to the bride and groom... ...how lucky they are to have found each other. In every life a little rain must fall. Fortunately... ...in my life... . When I was growing up, I played the one on the far left. Remind me to introduce you to someone. - Who? - Fourth gear. What does he want? I wasn't doing anything. Maybe he saw your hands slip briefly from the 10 and 2:00 position. Maybe it's Sergeant Sagittarius coming back to flirt some more. It's a different guy. - Good evening, sir. - Do you know how fast you were going? No, I don't, but it couldn't have been more than 60. You're right. It was 37. You're not ticketing me for driving too slow, are you? That's right. You know, officer... . I had the weirdest dream last night. Oh, my God! Your license, please. You don't want to hear about my dream... ...Officer... ...Pretty? It's Petty. I'll be right back with your ticket. - You have a son. - I know. I know. - Feel better? - Yeah. Much. Listen... . Not that I'm insecure about my manhood or anything, but... ...I need to hook up with a woman right now. I understand. You look familiar. Do I know you? I don't think so. Maybe it's because I'm on television. - I'm an actor on <i>Days of our Lives. </i> - Wow. Really? - $4.50, please. - Oh, let me get this.

What grandmother? - Where have you been? - Taking my parents to the hotel. - Going back to work? - Yeah. - Nice shades. - Lf I wear these in my scenes... ...I won't get spit in my eyes. And, if I remember correctly, Ray-Ban was the official sponsor of WWI. Great! All right! I'll see you later. - Where's Chandler? - I think he's in Rachel's room. Chandler? - Is Monica here? - She's steaming her dress. Why? - I think Chandler's gone. - What? - He left that. - ""Tell Monica I'm sorry. "" Oh, my God. What's up? ""Tell Monica I'm sorry. "" Tell her yourself. Oh, my God. Chandler just left, though? Maybe it's not what we think. ""Tell Monica I'm sorry I drank the last of the milk. "" Or maybe he was writing to tell her that he's changed his name: ""Tell Monica, I'm Sorry. "" - It means he freaked out and left! - Don't be so negative! Good God, isn't it possible that ""Sorry"" is sitting in there right now? Phoebe, I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do? I'm gonna have to go find him and bring him back. You make sure Monica does not find out, okay? But, if you don't find him and bring him back... ...I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass! I will find him. Joey? Can you go through these lines with me? Oh, man, they just re-did my makeup. - Just the last two pages. - All right. I found the picture! Picture? What picture? The picture of my wife I found in your pack. - Could you lower the script? - I don't want to. I need to see your face so I can play off your reaction. Okay, look. I know you're great and play all those Shakespeare guys... ...but you're spitting all over me, man. - Of course I am! - You know you've been spitting? That's what real actors do. Enunciation is the mark of a good actor. And when you enunciate, you spit! Wow. Didn't know that. Thanks. Okay, check it out. Picture? What picture? - Have you seen Chandler? - No, I haven't seen him. - Damn. - He's getting married tomorrow, right? Yes. Don't worry. Everything's fine. - See you at the wedding. - I wasn't invited. Then we'll see you the day after tomorrow. Mom? Dad? What are you doing here? We thought we'd see what the fuss is all about. - I see why the girls like coming here. - Why? The sexy blond behind the counter. - Gunther? - She just added him to her list. - Your list? - Of people we're allowed to sleep... I know what the list is. Come on, sit down. Have a cup of joe. Dad, I can't. I'm sorry. If you see Chandler, tell him I'm looking for him. And if you see Rita Moreno, let her know I'm looking for her. Action! I found the picture! What picture? A picture of my wife, in your pack! You went through my personal property? Why do you have a picture of Paulette in your pack? Because, Vincent, we were lovers... ...for two years! Cut! Wonderful! Great scene, huh? You were awesome. In that last speech, you soaked me. - Tomorrow's call sheet. - I'm not working tomorrow. - You are now. - No, you gotta get me out of it. I have plans. Important plans! - Still no word from Chandler. - Oh, man. But they found the grandmother wandering down 5th. Okay, well there's one down. I'm getting married today! I cracked a rib, but I don't care. Today's my wedding! My day is finally here! She might not even notice he's gone. I'm gonna start getting ready! We can't let her start getting ready. This is too awful! She'll be in the gown, and he won't show up. Then she'll have to take off the gown... Stop it. You can't do this here. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just so sad. Pull it together. She can't see you like this. - She'll know something's wrong. - I know. I know. There's no tissue. Can you grab me some toilet paper? Oh, that's gone too. This is Monica's bathroom, right? I found one. Thank you. Oh, God. Can I have another one? Sure. Do you need some floss? I can't imagine what will happen if he doesn't show up. Here's a whole bunch. She'll be at the wedding waiting... ...and people will be whispering, ""That poor girl. "" Then she'll have to come back here and live alone. - Oh, my God. - What? There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and it's positive. Monica's pregnant. So I guess she won't be totally alone. <i>Next time on</i> Friends: - We've gotta tell her. - No, we can't. She's getting ready. Can't you stall her? I'm never gonna get married. We've just got one scene with you two, and Richard is a pro. - Are you drunk? - No! Yes, you are! All right. - How's Chandler? - Great! - Where are you? - On the set. It's turning into the worst wedding ever.

724,"Oh, my God! I know. Monica's gonna have a baby! Can this count as her ""something new""? Oh, my God. Do you think this is why he took off? She had to have just taken it. I took out the trash last night. It's turning into the worst wedding ever. The bride's pregnant, the groom's missing and I'm holding this. Phoebe, we cannot tell anyone about this. - Right. Yeah. - Okay? Do you know what kind of birth control she uses? No. Why? Just for the future. This is hardly a commercial for it. The One With Monica and Chandler's Wedding Anything? No. I talked to Joey. He hasn't heard from him. I talked to Chandler's parents again. - You said he was missing? - No. It seemed like I called to chat. Pretty sure they both think I'm interested. - We've got to tell her. - No, we can't. She'll start getting ready soon. Can't you stall her? I'll go to the places I went last night. How much time? How long before she has to get ready? - One hour. - Give me two. Then why do you ask? - Wish me luck. - I'm going with you. Why? You're tired. You looked all night. And clearly, you suck at this. See you later. Wait, do you know how you're gonna stall her? - I'll figure something out. - Okay, good luck. Let's start with my makeup and then do my hair. Okay. But before you do that, I need you to talk to me. About what? I'm never gonna get married! You will. The right guy's around the corner. Okay, are we done with that? No, I'm serious. Maybe I should just forget about it. Become a lesbian or something. Any woman would be lucky to have you. Maybe I'd feel better if I slept with Joey. Rachel? Are you okay? Excuse me, Aaron? I have a little problem with the schedule. I wasn't supposed to work today. I have a wedding that I have to be at. It's my best friend's, and I'm officiating... ...so I really can't work past 4. You've gotta stay until the end. We can't stop filming just for you. It's not like it's your wedding. I'm having surgery. What? I made up the wedding, because I didn't want you to worry. But I'm having surgery today. What kind of surgery? Transplant. You're supposed to work on Monday. Hair transplant. But you're not bald. It's not on my head. There's nothing I can do. You'll probably be out by 4 anyway. We've got one scene. It's just you and Richard, and he's a pro. You'll be fine. Morning, Richard. Hey, you're here! Great! Let's go, buddy! We got a scene to shoot! I'm wearing two belts. - Are you drunk? - No. Yes, you are! All right. So this is your office? How'd you guys find me? I knew I should've hid at the gym. - What the hell are you doing? - Panicking. And using the Internet to try to prove that I'm related to Monica. - How is she? - She doesn't know you're gone. And she doesn't have to know. Come on, we're going home. - I can't do that. - Why not? If I go home, we're gonna become the Bings. I can't be the Bings. What's wrong with it? The Bings have bad marriages. They yell, fight, and use the pool boy... ...as a pawn in their sexual games. Have you ever put on a black dress and asked me up to your hotel room? - No. - Then you are neither of your parents. It's not just their marriage. Look at yours. Look at everybody's. Only Paul Newman can make marriage work. And I am no Paul Newman. I don't race cars or make popcorn. None of my proceeds go to charity. But look, Chandler... ...right now no one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this. I want to. I love her so much, but I'm afraid... It's too huge. You're right. It is huge. So let's take it just a little bit at a time. Forget getting married for a sec. Can you just come home and take a shower? That's not scary, right? Depends on what you mean by ""we. "" The nights are the hardest. But then the day comes... ...and that's every bit as hard as the night. - Then the night comes... - Days and nights are hard, I get it! I have to start getting ready. I'm getting married today. I know. At dusk. That's such a hard time for me. I'm gonna put makeup on. We have to be there in an hour. - Wait! - What? Let's go to lunch! I can't go to lunch! Right. Oh, good God, I've fallen down. What's going on? All right, honey, listen. When I tell you what I'm about to tell you, remember... ...that we're all here for you, and we love you. Okay, you're really freaking me out. We can't find Chandler... His vest. We can't find Chandler's vest. How can that be? Wait, are you serious? Found the vest. We'll have to keep an eye on it, make sure we don't lose it again. Oh, wow! Okay, don't scare me like that, okay? For a minute, I was like, ""Oh, my God! The worst has happened! "" So you two were married, huh? What happened, you just drift apart? Here comes the bride. Oh, my God, Monica! I want to wear this every day. You look so beautiful. I'm so happy for me. - Hello? - Did Chandler show up yet? - We got him back. Everything's fine. - Damn it! - Where are you? - I'm still on the set. The wedding is in less than an hour. I'm sorry. The guy's drunk. They won't let me go until we get it. Oh, my God. I'm gonna have to find another minister. No, I'm the minister! Put them both on the phone and I'll marry them right now. Joey, I have to go. Don't hang up on me! I'll marry you and me right now! I have the power! There you go! You put on a tuxedo! That wasn't scary, was it? No. I'm telling you, just a little bit at a time. Okay. What's the next little bit? Getting married. You can do that too. Just like you've done everything else. Yeah, you're right. I can do that. - Excuse me for a minute. - Where you going? I'm not gonna run away. I just want some fresh air. - Okay. - Okay. Oh, fresh air! - Cover for me. - Maybe you overreacted. You do that. We gotta do something. Joey won't make it, so I'll look around for other weddings. Don't tell them Monica's pregnant, because they frown on that. Okay. Anastassakis Papasifakis Wedding. Excellent. Congratulations. Hi! Oh, great hat. I need you to perform another wedding. Can you do that? I don't know. Are they Greek Orthodox? Yeah. Yeah. They're my friends, Monica Stephanopolis. And Chandler Acidophilus. Has anyone seen Chandler? - I thought he was with you. - He was with me. We're playing a game. Hide-and-seek. You can't ask us, son. That's cheating. You're right. Thanks for keeping me honest, Dad. He can't come here and see the bride in her wedding dress. When we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding dress. That was after the wedding. It's not bad luck then. Honey, it isn't good luck. Oh, my God! Monica. I know! - How's Chandler doing? - Great. He's doing great. Don't you worry about Chandler. - Phoebe, can I see you for a second? - Yeah. - What's going on? - Chandler's gone again. Why would you play hide-and-seek with someone you know is a flight risk? Aaron, you gotta let me go. The guy's hammered. I'm sorry. As long as he's here and conscious, we're still shooting. You wouldn't happen to have a very big fork? So, I just talked to the director. That's it. We're done for the day. We finished the scene? - You were wonderful. - As were you. So I got your car. It's right outside. Thank you. You're welcome. No, we gotta go. Come on. Here we go. Is that my ass? - There he is! - What? You won't get away this time! Unless you want that ass-kicking we talked about! Ross! I'm serious! You're not walking out on my sister! That's right. I'm not. - Then where have you been? - I know about Monica. - You know? - What? - I heard you and Rachel talking. - About what? You don't know? If somebody doesn't tell me right now... . What, you'll ""hi-yah""? Monica's pregnant. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. And you're not freaking out? I was. Then I went to the gift shop for cigarettes. - Cigarettes? - Big picture, please! So I was in the gift shop, that's when I saw this... . And I thought anything that can fit into this can't be scary. You obviously didn't see <i>Chuckie III. </i> But come on, look at how cute and small this is. So I got it to give Monica, so she'd know I was okay. Dude. Way to go, son. I knew you'd find him. Our little boy is getting married. Look at you, so handsome. You look beautiful, Mom. You look beautiful too, Dad. I love you both. I'm so glad you're here. Are you Chandler? Are you Joey? - This is nice. - What? I've never walked down the aisle knowing it can't end in divorce. I wish your grandmother had lived to see this. - She's right there. - Not that old crone. My mother. Congratulations, darling. We love you, sweetheart. You look beautiful. - Is this new? - Not now. - Who's this? - I'm Father Karabasos. He's Greek Orthodox. As are you. Let us begin. Dearly beloved... That's my line! I can take it from here. Thanks. Dearly beloved, I'm sorry I'm a little late. You may be confused by this now... ...but you won't be Memorial Day weekend, 2002. Let's get started before the groom takes off again. We are gathered here today... ...to join this man... ...and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I've known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can't... ...imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now, as I've left my notes in my dressing room... ...we shall proceed to the vows. Monica? - He took off? - Go on. Go on. Chandler, for so long... ...I wondered if I would ever find my prince. My soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding... ...I turned to a friend for comfort. And instead, I found everything that I'd been looking for my whole life. And now... ...here we are... ...with our future before us. And I only want to spend it with you. My prince. My soul mate. My friend. Unless you don't want to. You go. Chandler? No, that's okay. I thought this would be the most difficult thing I ever had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle, I realized it's simple. I love you. Any surprises that come our way, it's okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with. You want to know if I'm sure? You may now kiss the bride. I guess by the powers vested in me by the State of New York... ...and the Internet guys... ...I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh, wait. Do you take each other? - I do. - I do. Yeah, you do! Rings? Oh, crap. Let's do the rings. We good? Yeah? Good? Once again... ...I pronounce you husband and wife. Now kiss her again. I love you. And I know about the baby. - What baby? - Our baby. We have a baby? Phoebe found your pregnancy test. I didn't take a pregnancy test. Then who did? Look at them. And they're gonna have a baby.

We had a pact. {19050}{19198}- It's not like it was binding forever.|- It had the word ""eternity"" in it. {19218}{19285}Monica? Did you know about this? {19292}{19390}I didn't.

No! {23170}{23293}I gotta change my pants. What was|I thinking?

So you, me and London. {15469}{15533}Looking at people differently. {15539}{15627}Maybe he wants to do|what you and I did in London. {15632}{15686}But what'd he mean by ""rules""? {15692}{15784}Wait. He stopped talking|the minute Phoebe came in. {15792}{15886}- He's looking at her differently.|- Phoebe is his friend. {15892}{15944}That'd be breaking the rules. {15949}{16027}My God, he wants to do it|with Phoebe in London! {16039}{16111}- You guys?|- Just a minute! {16120}{16220}- That's Mrs. Tribbiani.|- You don't say anything. {16226}{16360}Why would I?

Sequoia! {20252}{20324}- Veto.|- Fine. {20391}{20543}Unless you anticipated that|I would figure all this out... {20548}{20629}...and you know that|it actually is a girl. {20634}{20718}And you really do want her|to be named Ruth. {20723}{20859}Well, I'm not falling for that!|Okay?

She's not only my friend,|she's my pregnant friend. {22070}{22136}She's my pregnant friend|who's Ross' ex! {22142}{22271}Yeah, that's Rachel.|Beat me over the head with it. {22300}{22411}What am I gonna do?

Fine. {21629}{21661}Not perfect. {21666}{21712}But good enough. {21722}{21762}Jeez, what's with you? {21767}{21840}I'm sorry, did you say ""cheese""? {21874}{21976}- What's going on?|- Phoebe says you and Don are soul mates. {21981}{22059}I don't believe in that,|but you two get along. {22065}{22191}I'll step aside if you wanna go with|Don and live in a house of cheese. {22197}{22319}- You don't believe in soul mates?|- No, but I'm sure ""tomatoes"" does. {22353}{22425}I don't believe in soul mates, either. {22430}{22461}- You don't?|- Nope. {22466}{22529}We weren't destined|to end up together. {22535}{22621}We fell in love and work hard|at our relationship. {22627}{22691}Some days we work really hard. {22706}{22807}So you don't want to live with Don|in a cheese house? {22812}{22956}No, I've had second thoughts.|Do you know how hard it'd be to clean? {22962}{23021}- I love you.|- I know. {23026}{23086}I'm gonna take you out to dinner. {23091}{23198}I found this place that makes|the greatest jalapeno poppers. {23240}{23288}No? They taste so good. {23438}{23523}It happens whenever Chandler|touches my stomach. {23528}{23597}I'm worried the baby won't like him. {23669}{23748}- Are you okay?|- Yeah, sure. {23813}{23880}Look, the reason... {23931}{23978}Is it hot in here? {23983}{24061}Why don't you take off your sweater? {24082}{24132}This is a nice place... {24138}{24253}...and my T-shirt has a picture|of Calvin doing Hobbes. {24258}{24349}Oh, my God, really?

Wow. {24882}{24913}A long time. {24946}{25017}But over the past few weeks, l... {25023}{25131}Okay!

Hey, that's... {28772}{28826}That's okay. That's fine. {28831}{28949}It's pretty much what I was expecting. {28983}{29044}It's no big deal, all right? {29120}{29211}- I think I'm gonna go.|- Please don't leave like this. {29216}{29306}You can't do this to a pregnant woman! {29326}{29366}Don't start doing that. {29372}{29457}You can't do that,|because you're gonna make me... {29462}{29510}Oh, there we go! {29570}{29644}- Can I?|- Sure. {29690}{29751}Oh, Joey. I don't want to lose... {29756}{29807}Hey, hey. {29852}{29940}You can't, okay? Ever. {29966}{30029}I'm so sorry. {30034}{30108}Please don't be sorry. {30114}{30167}Okay?

817,"Joey? Are you in there? - That's Rachel. - You have to talk to her. I can't. Not after the other night. It's too weird. Don't tell her I'm here. Don't eat that! - Hey! - Hey, Rachel. Is Joey here? - I don't see him. You? - No. Maybe he's in the sugar bowl. Joey? Nope. Well, at least you make each other laugh. - What's up? - I haven't seen him since he said... ...how he, you know... I don't know, I think he's avoiding me. Why is that bagel on the floor? - We were playing a game. - Was Chandler naked? Sort of like a ring-toss kind of situation? - Sure! - What? No! No! All right, listen. If you see Joey, will you just tell him that...? Tell him I miss him. - Okay. Did you hear that? - Yeah. That naked bagel game? Dude, I don't know. That's a pretty small hole. - You've gotta talk to her. - I can't. You guys don't know what it's like to get shot down. I don't know what that's like? Until I was 25, I thought the response to ""I love you"" was ""Oh, crap."" No rejection? I got shot down at fat camp. Boy, kids are mean when they're hungry. So, what do I do? It's Rachel. You're gonna never talk to her again? It's weird and it's awkward, but you gotta at least try. Yeah, okay. I forgot this was on your... We didn't play it! The One With the Tea Leaves I'll look at your tea leaves and tell your fortune. - You read tea leaves? - I've done it for years. I actually stopped because I was so accurate. And one of the great joys of life... ...is its wondrous unpredictability, you know? And also, tea tends to give me the trots. - Okay. I'm done. Read mine. - Okay. I see a ladder. Which can mean either a promotion or a violent death. I'm the head chef. I can't get promoted. Who's next? I'm done. Do mine. Okay. Oh! Okay, I see a circle. Which can either mean you're having a baby... ...or you'll make a scientific discovery! Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab. - What does yours say, Pheebs? - All right. Wow! Yay! Oh, I'm gonna meet a guy! And really soon! He's gonna be the man of my dreams. Probably not the guy I had a dream about last night. Has anyone seen my shirt? It's a button-down, like a faded salmon color? You mean your pink shirt? Faded salmon color? No, I haven't seen your pink shirt. I must have left it at Mona's. I knew it! I'm sure you can get another one at Ann Taylor's. That's my favorite shirt. I love it. Ask Mona to give it back. I don't know. I could. We didn't really end things on good terms. If I went, I'd be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do... ...jump up my own ass and die. Oh, wait a second, you guys? I've been seeing that guy everywhere I go. We take the same bus, go to the same bookstore. Maybe he's the tea guy. Did you see that? He totally checked you out! And he is so cute! Mine is a picture of the Village People. What's that mean? Hi. Hey. - Hi. - Hi. Tea gives Phoebe the trots! I thought Joey and I would be okay... ...but we don't know how to be together. - It's tough, but things will improve. - How do you know? What if it gets worse and worse... ...to the point where we can't be in the same room? I'm not great at the advice. Can I interest you in a sarcastic comment? Some cheese? Honey, why is the Bruce Springsteen CD in the Cat Stevens case? If I can't find the right case, I use the nearest one. - Where is the Cat Stevens CD? - The James Taylor case. - Where is that CD? - I'll save you time. Two hundred CDs, not one of them in the right case. Okay. No need to panic. Deep breaths, everyone. We'll just have to put the CDs in their right cases. If we do that, we should come up with some kind of order. We have to talk this through. Oh, my God, you have such problems! I feel so terrible for you! All right. Okay, I'm sorry. You're both focusing on this uncomfortable thing. Change the subject. Get him talking about something else. Yeah, that makes sense. Maybe you need his advice on a work problem... - I could do that. - Good. The Miami Vice soundtrack? Really? They were just giving those away at the store. In exchange for money. Hey. I really don't know what to tell you. Maybe Joey could help you out with your big work problem. - What? - Yeah, Joey, she's... Rachel's got this big work problem. It is a head-scratcher. Know what? If we're gonna make dinner, we're gonna have to leave. So you have a big work problem? Yeah. It's, uh... Yeah, it's, uh... You know, it's nothing. Okay. So I think I'm gonna take off. No, wait, Joey, it is. It's something. It's... It's my boss. - Yeah? - Yeah. And, uh... And my baby. My boss wants to buy my baby. What? Oh, my God! I know, I told you, it's a really big problem! - He wants to buy your baby? - Can you believe that? - That's crazy. - That's what I told him! - How did this even happen? - Well, I'll tell you. See, my boss and his wife, they can't have children, so... And then when we were at the Christmas party... ...he got drunk and said to me, ""Rachel, I want to buy your baby."" When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby... ...I figured it was about maternity leave. Oh. Yeah. Yeah, that would have been a much simpler problem. - Oh, hello. - Oh, it's you. I see you everywhere. I'm Jim. Jim Nelson. Hi, Jim-Jim Nelson. I'm Phoebe-Phoebe Buffay. - We've seen each other a lot lately. - Yes. Maybe we'll see each other at dinner tomorrow. Around 8:00? Well, maybe we will. Mona? Okay, if I were a salmon shirt, where would I be? I am so sorry I spilled wine all over your shirt. - It's okay. - No, it's still wet. Let me get it out before it sets. I have something you could wear. Here. I don't know if I want to wear a woman's shirt. - That's a man's shirt. - Awfully pink. It's not pink! Honey, we are so meant to be together. - We both have the Annie soundtrack. - Honey, both yours. Hey, great advice on that Joey thing. - The work problem? - It was perfect. It felt like he was my friend. - What problem did you say you have? - Oh, that's not important. The point is, I think everything's gonna be okay. May I help you? You think you can just buy my friend's baby? Isn't it funny how we kept meeting? It's as if someone wants us together. Someone does. Me. Witty banter. Well done. Good. - Tell me a little bit about yourself. - Okay. I'm a masseuse. - And I used to work at this place... - Do you like to party? I like parties. You're wild, aren't you? - Yeah, I guess. A little. - Ain't no thing. I'm wild too. So anyway... ...I've lived in New York, somewhat wildly, I guess... ...for, well, since I was 14. I'm sorry. I'm staring. It's just that you have the most beautiful eyes. Oh, stop it. And your breasts! Okay. Look, you're coming on a little strong. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. The universe wants us to be together. Why don't we start over? You can tell me about yourself. - All right. - Okay. I write erotic novels... ...for children. - What? - They're wildly unpopular. Oh, my God! Also, you might like to know I have a Ph.D. - Wow! You do? - Yep. A pretty huge... All right. - Hey. - Joey, honey, listen. Thanks for talking to me yesterday. It meant a lot. Not a problem. Just so you know... ...that guy won't be bothering you about that baby thing anymore. - What? - Let's just say I took care of it. Let's say more. Don't worry. I told him, very nicely: ""You don't go buying people's babies! So back off!"" - What? - What? No, no, no! He doesn't want to buy my baby! I made that up! What? Why? So we would have something to talk about! And you couldn't think of anything else? You said your boss wants to buy your baby? You yelled at my boss! I'll lose my job! What am I gonna do? You could always sell your baby. I can't believe you brought my boss into it! I'll be fired! - You lied to me! - Well, she told me to! Chandler has two copies of Annie! Oh, my God! - Ross! - Hello! What are you doing? Not touching myself, if that makes anyone less uncomfortable. Morning. You wanted to see me? Please, come in. Have a seat. - Look, Mr. Zelner... - It's best I speak first. Yeah. Lee from human resources is here as a witness to our conversation. Oh, God. If I in any way implied that I wanted to buy your baby... ...I am sorry. Okay? Last week, when I asked you when your due date was... ...I certainly did not mean that I felt that I was ""due"" your baby. I want to be very clear... ...that I understand that it's your baby... ...and it is not mine to purchase. Well, as long as we are clear about that. There it is. - Not your regular cleaners. - I know. That creep goes there. I had to find a new one. I have to find a new bank, adult bookstore, grocery store... - What? - A new grocery store. The universe said I'd meet a nice guy. I got that? When I get up there, I'm gonna kick some ass. You'll meet someone. If I can meet a great guy, so can you. Yeah, we both can. And we both will. - You didn't have to come in. - You kidding? This is where they get out stains. This is like Disneyland for me. I'm gonna be over here watching the dance of the clean shirts. Excuse me. I think you dropped... - Wow! - What? Sorry. You're just so incredibly beautiful. Well, I'm sorry about that too. But what are you gonna do? Don't think I'm crazy, but I was meant to pick this up. - Do you believe in that kind of thing? - A little. Now you're talking. - Want to go for coffee? - I'd love to. Let me tell my friend. An ink stain! Can I watch how you get this out? She must have left. - So? What happened? - It's all gonna be okay. They're so happy I'm not suing, I got an extra month paid maternity leave. So long as I understand the money should not be construed... ...as a down payment on this or any other child. Ralph Lauren is going out of their way... ...to show they're not in the baby-buying business. - Give us a minute? - Kicking me out of my living room? Yeah. I'll be in there. I'm sorry I lied to you. I was just trying to make things... I know. I know. It kind of worked. I don't know about you, but I haven't thought about our thing. Yeah, you're right. Yeah. It's kind of been like ""us"" again, a little bit. - Yeah, I know. I've missed that. - Me too. I haven't thought about how I put myself out there... ...and said that stuff. How you didn't feel the same... ...and how it was really awkward. My gynecologist tried to kill me. Item J437-A. Color: winterberry. Hi, listen. Come here. Come... I'm so, so sorry about yesterday. Listen, you don't have to apologize. I understand why you were there. - You do? - Yeah. You still have feelings for me. To be honest, I still have feelings for you. I wish we could work out, but we can't. It's too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby. I just... It just wasn't meant to be. Oh, God. You're right. Ross, we have to be strong. Okay, I'm gonna go. Can I? To remember you? No. Subtitles by SDI Media Group [ENGLISH] <font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>"

She said you|actually proposed to her. {16738}{16861}Well, I didn't!

I need a good lie to explain|why I wasn't at a work thing today. {7802}{7862}- Honey, you stink at lying.|- I do not. {7867}{7947}Really? Let me ask you something.|Yesterday at the coffeehouse... {7951}{8039}...I went to the bathroom. When I came|back, my muffin was gone. Who took it? {8074}{8127}Somebody opened the door|to the coffeehouse... {8131}{8226}...and a raccoon ran in and went|straight for your muffin. I said: {8230}{8309}""Hey, don't eat that!|That's Phoebe's! "" And he said... {8363}{8454}He said, ""Joey, you stink at lying.""|What am I gonna do? {8458}{8523}Don't worry. We'll come up with a lie.|I'll help you. {8528}{8623}- Great. That'd be great. Thank you.|- Sure. What was the work thing? {8659}{8733}- ""Pick up Grandma at the airport.""|- Oh, man! {8811}{8866}She's precious. {8878}{8968}Do you ever worry|that she's gonna get your real nose? {8972}{9018}Amy... {9045}{9102}Yes, I do. I really do. {9208}{9246}Hello? {9250}{9335}Yeah, hang on, one sec.|Can I take this upstairs? {9339}{9393}Sure. We don't live there, but... {9417}{9512}Seriously? It's just these rooms? {9529}{9621}- I thought you were a doctor.|- Yeah. No, Ross has a Ph.D. {9759}{9839}God, she is unbelievable. {9844}{9918}I know. I mean, a Ph.D.|Is just as good as an MD. {9923}{9965}Sure, Ross, yeah! {9969}{10075}If I have a heart attack at a restaurant,|I want you there with your fossil brush. {10122}{10172}- Stupid Thanksgiving.|- What? {10176}{10252}- What? What happened?|- My boyfriend canceled on me. {10256}{10316}I mean, I finally find a real relationship. {10320}{10439}Someone that I can spend this day with,|and then his wife comes back into town! {10443}{10521}I swear, it's almost not even|worth dating married guys. {10532}{10574}Don't say that. {10608}{10667}God, I was so looking forward to this. {10671}{10744}It was gonna be such|a beautiful Thanksgiving. {10748}{10806}We were gonna have sushi. {10835}{10899}Amy, don't cry. {10927}{11016}- Ross, can I talk to you in private?|- Sure, you wanna go upstairs, or...? {11133}{11205}Look, I was thinking,|if it's okay with Monica... {11209}{11271}...I would like to invite Amy|to Thanksgiving. {11279}{11421}I think that's a great idea. It'll be like|the Pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis. {11453}{11523}Look, I know she's a little tough to take. {11527}{11631}But she has nowhere else to go,|and she's my sister. She's Emma's aunt. {11635}{11755}- And I would like them to bond.|- I don't want them bonding too much. {11759}{11820}I don't want her telling Emma|she needs a nose job. {11825}{11920}Ross, she may need one. We're just|gonna have to make our peace with that! {12097}{12140}- Hi!|- Hey. {12144}{12221}Hey, you guys. This is my sister, Amy. {12225}{12323}This is Chandler, Joey,|Phoebe, and you know Mon. {12328}{12364}Oh, my God. {12368}{12421}You're on ""Days of our Lives""! {12425}{12458}Yeah. {12462}{12544}Wow! They must put|a lot of makeup on you. {12596}{12652}Happy Thanksgiving. {12677}{12721}- Hey.|- Hi. {12777}{12850}So welcome. Is this the first time|you're seeing Emma? {12855}{12930}Yeah, I think so.|It's nice to meet you, Emma. {12983}{13063}- Phoebe.|- That's a funny noise. {13152}{13244}- Pheebs? I still need some help here.|- Right. Okay. {13248}{13354}So it's not just the lie you tell,|but it's the way you tell it. For example... {13358}{13438}...if you look at the ground when|you talk, people know you're lying. {13458}{13555}I don't know why this is so hard for me.|Lying is basically just acting... {13559}{13641}...and I am a terrific actor.|- You are a terrific actor. {13709}{13803}- Hey. Where's the baby?|- We just put her down for a nap. {13807}{13896}Listen, I was just thinking.|You know what would be incredible? {13901}{13966}If you guys died! {13997}{14050}Thank you, Amy. {14055}{14123}No, no, then I would get the baby. {14127}{14231}It would be just like a movie. At first|I wouldn't know what to do with her. {14235}{14334}And then I would rise to the occasion.|Then I'd get a makeover and get married. {14339}{14395}That's a great movie! {14432}{14506}Yeah. Listen, not that you guys|could stop me or anything... {14511}{14568}...because you know, you'd be dead. {14572}{14627}But I was thinking about|changing her name. {14631}{14689}I'm just not really a big fan of Emily. {14728}{14767}Emma. {14783}{14831}Emma? Ross wants you. {14887}{14937}Phoebe! {14968}{15040}Why does she keep making that noise? {15101}{15157}Honey, I don't know|how to tell you this... {15161}{15265}...but if something were to happen|to Ross or myself... {15270}{15348}...you wouldn't get the baby.|- Well, who would? {15364}{15451}Well, we haven't officially|asked them yet... {15455}{15520}...but we would want|Monica and Chandler. {15524}{15579}I can't believe you'd want us|to raise Emma. {15583}{15629}Oh, my God, I'm so moved. {15634}{15698}I don't believe this. Hold on a second.|You guys die... {15702}{15762}...and I don't get your baby? {15767}{15847}Amy, see, we're a lot closer|to Monica and Chandler. {15851}{15953}We see them every day. And truthfully,|you don't seem connected to the baby. {15958}{16044}Connected? To what? She's a lump. {16107}{16175}You know, guys, I've gotta say|this means so much to me. {16180}{16259}I mean, that you would|trust me with your child. {16263}{16326}I mean, we all know|that Monica and I have been... {16330}{16386}...trying to have a baby of our own. {16390}{16515}You know, I've had my doubts|about my skills as a father, but... {16551}{16601}That you two... {16614}{16689}- That you two...|- This guy? {16719}{16756}Seriously? {16886}{16939}Okay, it's time for dinner. {16943}{17008}Everyone, we're using our fancy china... {17012}{17106}...and it's very expensive,|so please be careful. {17270}{17359}Okay, just to be clear, comedy with|the plates will not be well-received. {17542}{17585}Hey! {17589}{17683}How come my plate's less fancy|than everyone else's? {17710}{17772}Do you not trust me with a fancy plate? {17776}{17851}No, honey. That's a special plate. {17855}{17944}See, it's a game.|Whoever gets that plate wins. {17981}{18048}I can't believe I won! {18071}{18150}You know, this is such a slap|in the face. I mean, I'm your sister... {18154}{18249}...and you would give your baby|to these strangers over me. {18254}{18314}Monica is Ross' sister. {18327}{18418}No, Ross' sister was really fat. {18455}{18489}That was me. {18506}{18613}No, she was this dorky girl in school who|followed Rachel around like a puppy... {18619}{18674}Amy, you've got to stop doing that! {18820}{18889}Okay, listen, I know you're having|a bit of a family crisis... {18893}{18955}...but you don't have to take it out|on the plates. {18959}{19027}I mean, in fact, I think that everyone... {19031}{19125}...should cut their food like this: {19180}{19250}Now, see? This way,|you protect the plates... {19258}{19304}...and let's face it, you have fun. {19346}{19413}Okay, how about this?|If you guys die... {19417}{19509}...and the crazy plate lady dies... {19531}{19610}...then do I get the baby?|- No, if crazy plate lady... {19676}{19768}If Monica dies,|then I would get Emma. Right? {19851}{19918}- Well, actually...|- Actually what? {19923}{20004}It's just...|It's just that in that case... {20008}{20054}...then Emma would go|to my parents. {20066}{20117}- What?|- Hurts, doesn't it? {20202}{20279}Who has to die for me to get her? {20434}{20513}So if Monica's not around,|I'm not good enough to raise Emma? {20518}{20576}No, that is not what we're saying. {20581}{20622}Yeah, he's lying. He looked down. {20683}{20734}Well, what's wrong with me?|Am I incompetent? {20739}{20825}Because I managed to survive whatever|it is that killed the three of you! {20891}{21012}You're taking this the wrong way.|We think you'll be a wonderful parent. {21016}{21104}It's just... You're more|the, you know, fun parent. {21108}{21209}Yeah, and we wanna make sure|Emma also has someone like Monica... {21213}{21258}...who's more of a disciplinarian. {21262}{21331}Someone who can be firm and strict. {21335}{21397}That's not how you see me, is it? {21423}{21484}No, you're all about the fun. {21632}{21720}I may not know a lot about babies,|but do you really think I'm not capable? {21725}{21790}No. You both are equally capable. {21794}{21856}It's just you're strongest|when you're together. {21861}{21953}Okay. So if we both had Emma,|and I died... {21969}{22010}...she'd have to give her up. {22025}{22089}Sure. Monica would have to give her up. {22103}{22173}I lie better than that, right? {22206}{22301}Let me just get this straight.|So my two friends die, I get Emma. {22305}{22403}Then my wife dies. Then Emma,|the one tiny ray of hope left in my life... {22407}{22491}...gets taken away from me?|- There's your movie. {22579}{22644}Hey, there you are. {22648}{22725}- You disappeared after dinner.|- Did somebody miss me? {22730}{22800}Was there a child to raise poorly? {22813}{22866}Ross and Rachel don't know|what they're saying. {22871}{22916}It's not like they're so responsible. {22920}{23027}Emma is a product of a bottle of merlot|and a five-year-old condom. {23071}{23167}No, but they're right. I'm not a strong|father figure, and I never will be. {23172}{23235}No, you learn these things.|You grow into it. {23241}{23283}Yeah, but it's not who I am. {23288}{23411}Everything they said is exactly why I was|worried about having a kid. And it's true. {23415}{23486}- And look, everybody knows it.|- I don't know it. {23490}{23576}I wanna have a kid with you because|I think you'll be an amazing dad. {23580}{23643}At the fun parts and at the hard parts. {23648}{23732}Well, can you picture me saying,|""Go to your room, you're grounded""? {23752}{23809}Can you hear me say,|""You're grounded""? {23813}{23872}You said that to me last week. {23916}{24000}How hard is it?|""No shoes on the furniture!"" {24157}{24256}The producer from ""Days"" left a message|asking why I wasn't at the parade. {24261}{24361}They said everybody's really pissed off|at me. And they all got to meet Santa! {24401}{24459}It's okay.|I thought of the perfect lie for you. {24464}{24547}It's easy to remember,|and it doesn't invite a lot of questions. {24552}{24644}You weren't at the parade|because you had a family emergency. {24649}{24710}I like that! Yeah! {24714}{24783}I wasn't at the parade|because I had a family emergency. {24788}{24835}What happened? {24839}{24913}- My sister's raccoon came...|- No, nothing with a raccoon! {24988}{25056}- Wait, what are you doing?|- Setting the table. {25060}{25152}We thought it might be nice|to use the fancy china for dessert too. {25157}{25243}How nice. Maybe later we can all|blow our noses on my wedding dress. {25417}{25473}Hey, dude, you okay?|Sorry about before. {25477}{25578}That's okay. You're totally right. I don't|know anything about disciplining a child. {25582}{25691}But it did hurt my feelings,|and I want you to know that if I die... {25695}{25749}...you don't get Joey. {26079}{26152}In case you hadn't noticed,|I'm not talking to you. {26203}{26269}You know, this is just...|This is classic Rachel. {26274}{26381}Right. Remember in high school when|I died and didn't give you my baby? {26443}{26513}This might be my one chance|to have a child, Rachel. {26518}{26598}I mean, you know that I have been|so busy focusing on my career... {26602}{26693}- What career?|- I'm a decorator. {26698}{26779}You decorate Dad's office|and now you're a decorator? {26783}{26895}Okay, I went to the zoo yesterday,|now I'm a koala bear. {26963}{27054}- Why can't you ever be supportive?|- You want to talk supportive? {27058}{27149}You didn't come and visit me when|I was in the hospital having the baby! {27153}{27249}You didn't come see me in the hospital|when I was getting my lips done! {27285}{27337}I did the first time. {27389}{27472}You know what? You want to know|why I am not giving Emily to you? {27476}{27534}- Emma.|- Whose side are you on?! {27567}{27676}I'm not giving you Emma because you|can't handle the responsibility of a child. {27688}{27769}Well, how hard could it be?|You do it. {27874}{27953}You wanna know why|you don't want me to have the baby? {27957}{28011}Because you don't want me to be happy. {28015}{28102}- You have always been jealous of me.|- Jealous of what? {28106}{28195}Of your lack of responsibility?|Your immaturity? {28199}{28271}Your total disregard|for other people's feelings? {28276}{28332}To name a few. {28377}{28416}You've always been like this. {28420}{28502}You had to have everything,|and I couldn't have anything. {28506}{28583}Like in junior high,|when you stole Timmy from me. {28587}{28656}I mean, do you even realize|how much that hurt me? {28661}{28720}Timmy was my boyfriend,|and you made out with him! {28725}{28799}Come on, that was 20 years ago.|Get over it. {28806}{28877}I cannot believe|that I invited you here today! {28881}{28975}Yeah, well, you know what I cannot|believe? That my so-called sister... {28979}{29095}...gets a 30%""%"" discount from Ralph|Lauren, and I still have to pay retail? {29153}{29190}It's 45. {29223}{29267}You bitch. {29328}{29375}You just think you're so perfect... {29379}{29468}...with your new baby|and your small apartment. {29503}{29627}Well, let me tell you something.|Your baby isn't even that cute. {29660}{29749}Too far, Amy.

Make me? {29919}{29989}Hey, man, I work out! {30027}{30073}- So do I.|- I do Pilates. {30078}{30119}- I do yoga.|- Bring it on! {30132}{30201}Put the plates in the boxes!|Put the plates in the boxes! {30260}{30318}- Did you just push me?|- Yeah, I think I did. {30323}{30354}All right, that's it. {30359}{30426}Forget the bubble wrap!|There isn't time! {30480}{30523}Frizzy, frizzy, frizzy! {30638}{30702}- Shouldn't we stop this?|- Are you out of your mind? {30706}{30763}Let's throw some Jell-O on them! {30874}{30914}Gross! {31193}{31313}All right, that is it! This is our apartment,|and you cannot behave this way! {31317}{31383}If you can't act your age,|you shouldn't be here at all. {31388}{31505}Those plates may not be as nice as|the pretty pink ones that I picked out... {31526}{31648}...but they're important to Monica.|And I want you to apologize to her, now. {31654}{31715}- I'm sorry.|- Mon, I'm so sorry. {31719}{31765}Okay. That's better. {31769}{31850}Now, I want you to apologize|to each other and mean it. {31864}{31898}- Sorry.|- Sorry. {31903}{31983}By the way, that fight|was totally arousing. {32084}{32130}Dude, well done. {32135}{32256}If I die and Rachel dies and Monica dies,|you can totally take care of Emma. {32273}{32316}Yeah?

I have a baby. {26423}{26465}I'll watch her. {26517}{26546}Why would you do that? {26555}{26667}Because you worked really hard, and|it's your job.

Get off your sister! {26437}{26498}Oh, my God. What are we gonna do? {26502}{26577}The... We have seven rats. {26581}{26644}So, what if each of them|has seven rats... {26648}{26742}...and then each of those|has seven rats? That's like... {26817}{26892}That's math I can't even do! {26916}{26963}What are we gonna do? {26968}{27025}Well, I know this is gonna|sound crazy... {27030}{27188}...but we could|not let the box of rats ruin our lives. {27237}{27323}Yeah, okay. I guess you're right. {27327}{27407}All right, so we should just|give them away. {27422}{27554}But to nice families with children|and reduced-fat Wheat Thins. {27558}{27615}Those were Bob's favorites. {27619}{27665}It's gonna be okay. {27696}{27786}- You must think I'm crazy.|- No, I think you're sweet. {27791}{27945}Good. This is just so hard.|It's hard for me to let them go. {27950}{28044}I guess it just brings back memories,|you know... {28058}{28175}...from when I gave birth to my brother's|triplets and I had to give them up. {28319}{28376}I haven't told you about that yet,|have I? {28676}{28755}Thanks for the party, honey.|Should I help you clean up? {28759}{28863}No way.

I feel that you're a little annoying. {31610}{31642}See, why?

Listen, I think I left something|here. {32630}{32701}Well, somebody left this.|Is this yours? {32706}{32741}No, but I like it. {32770}{32841}No, I think I left one of my rat babies. {32883}{32952}Well, no.

913,"{95}{148}- Hey.|- Yeah. Yeah, okay. Sure. {152}{222}Look, can we talk|about what happened here last night? {227}{317}Sure. Just give me a second|to get all huffy and weird like you. {328}{461}You believe that whoever did something|last night did what they did or didn't do? {477}{540}Okay, you really don't know|what I'm talking about? {545}{604}- No.|- Okay. Last night, after the party... {608}{694}...I saw Rachel kissing that jerk|from her office out on your balcony. {699}{733}Our balcony? Seriously? {737}{818}That's so funny. I told Monica|we should put lights on our balcony... {822}{910}...and she said, ""No, no. It's too cold.|Nobody will go out there. "" And I said: {914}{973}""Maybe if we put some lights|out there they will."" {1030}{1118}Right, that's what I came over to talk|about. I saw Rachel kissing some guy... {1122}{1212}...on your balcony,|even though there were no lights! {1241}{1306}So are you gonna talk to her? {1311}{1403}Why? Why should I? I mean,|if she wants to move on, that's fine. {1408}{1494}You know when ""that's fine"" sounds|true? When someone yells it and spits. {1512}{1625}No, I'm serious. I mean, if she wants|to date people, fine. I don't care. {1629}{1681}But at least she could have told me. {1685}{1769}You know, I've been putting my life on|hold and concentrating on Emma. {1774}{1909}But if she wants to go out there kissing|guys she barely knows, then so will I. {1978}{2036}Very funny! Ross is gay! {2073}{2117}No, no.|Good, so you're moving on. {2121}{2181}Do you have any idea|where you're moving on to? {2186}{2231}I've got plenty of opportunities. {2235}{2343}Just now, there was some woman|at the coffeehouse smiled at me. {2347}{2480}And then the other day on the subway,|a woman ""accidentally"" sat on my hand. {2496}{2600}Dude, don't rub my face|in your crazy single life. {2614}{2670}And there's an anthropologist|at school... {2674}{2764}...who totally came on to me during|the interdepartmental potluck dinner. {2769}{2832}Why did I get married? {2878}{2926}The One Where Monica Sings {2951}{3151}Ripped by|mrnch@dh.net.mk {3176}{3376}Subtitles processed by|Subtitle Editor (c) Digital Higherground - Igor Janevski, 2004 {4054}{4118}Hey, let me ask you guys something. {4122}{4165}I'm having new headshots|taken tomorrow. {4169}{4249}The photographer said she thinks|I should have my eyebrows waxed. {4253}{4308}Is that weird for a guy? {4313}{4365}- Well, it depends.|- On? {4370}{4438}On how far along he is|in the sex-change process. {4478}{4573}No, I totally disagree. I think it's fine|for a guy to do something like that. {4577}{4615}Especially an actor. {4620}{4689}I mean, not that you need to.|Your eyebrows are... {4790}{4857}Stop it, you guys. Stop staring,|you're freaking me out. {4862}{4917}Your knuckles are kind of hairy too. {4937}{5001}Oh, man, now I have to get|those done too? {5006}{5103}- Wow, talk about high maintenance.|- You dye your hair. {5108}{5185}- I'm a woman.|- Double standards! {5216}{5287}Before I forget, are you coming|to Mike's piano bar tonight? {5292}{5384}- Only if I don't have to get up and sing.|- But everybody sings.

You|were probably ironing wrapping paper. {7081}{7119}Oh, yeah. {7184}{7229}So how did you end up kissing? {7234}{7290}We were all alone|and he was being really nice... {7294}{7371}...and he gave me this scarf.|- I thought you hated him. {7375}{7441}Well, there is a thin line|between love and hate... {7445}{7555}...and it turns out that line|is a scarf. {7600}{7661}Are you thinking of starting|something up with this guy? {7665}{7738}I don't know. It's so complicated.|I work with this guy. {7742}{7827}I have the baby, and I have Ross.|I don't know what to do. {7831}{7909}And I have to be at the office|and see Gavin in 10 minutes. {7914}{7999}Sounds like you need to think|about what you want and talk to Gavin. {8003}{8098}- And you definitely should talk to Ross.|- Or... {8113}{8188}...I could call in sick|and not deal with it at all. {8213}{8284}Wow!

And I say,|""No. It's not, because it works for us."" {42159}{42205}But you know what?|This doesn't work. {42209}{42308}- In fact, this is the opposite of working.|- Clearly. {42350}{42391}And you know... {42395}{42484}...we said that we would live together|as long as this makes sense... {42488}{42593}...and maybe this|just doesn't make sense anymore. {42631}{42690}Yeah, maybe not. {42720}{42779}So, what do you wanna do? {42884}{42923}Hi. {42927}{43010}Can Emma and I live here for a while? {43015}{43072}God. {43089}{43182}- Of course.|- Thank you. {43282}{43350}Your eyebrows look weird. {43954}{44026}So you'll just touch yourself|for anything, then? {44150}{44175}[ENGLISH]"

It's like they're on fire! {14395}{14455}- What are they?|- Prototype sneakers. {14459}{14519}I need ideas on how to sell them.|Which I can't do... {14523}{14586}...because no self-respecting|adult would ever wear these. {14591}{14629}I'll give you $500 for them. {14727}{14800}- What am I supposed to do?|- Come on, sneakers are easy. {14804}{14893}- You wear them all the time.|- They're not called sneakers anymore. {14897}{15039}They're called ""kicks"" or ""skids.""|I think I heard somebody say ""slorps."" {15076}{15166}They've got wheels that pop out from|the bottom so you can roll around... {15170}{15252}...because apparently|walking is too much exercise. {15256}{15361}""Kids!

Have you considered|using a girl with huge knockers? {15602}{15647}That's not what they're looking for. {15652}{15713}Hey, that would work on me. {15717}{15766}Why do you think I buy|Mrs. Butterworth's? {16023}{16078}You'll never guess what just happened. {16082}{16146}- Phoebe and I got mugged!|- Are you okay? {16151}{16213}Yeah. Phoebe knew the mugger. {16234}{16267}How do you know a mugger? {16272}{16374}I'm sorry, I have friends|outside the six of us. {16378}{16453}Know how she knew him?|Because Phoebe used to mug people. {16458}{16499}Seriously? {16503}{16588}Well, I'm not proud of it,|but, you know... {16592}{16717}...when I was living on the street and|I needed money for food and stuff... {16722}{16815}- That is awful.|- I wasn't rich like you guys, okay? {16819}{16917}I didn't eat gold and have a flying pony. {16922}{17021}I had a hard life.|My mother was killed by a drug dealer. {17026}{17140}- Your mother killed herself.|- She was a drug dealer. {17160}{17279}It was a good thing she knew him.|I was about to do some serious damage. {17284}{17317}Okay. {17357}{17429}This must have brought back|some bad memories for you, Ross. {17434}{17501}- Why?|- Ross was mugged as a kid. {17506}{17584}- You were?|- Yeah. And it was pretty traumatic. {17588}{17640}It was outside St. Mark's Comics. {17644}{17764}I was minding my business, seeing what|kind of trouble Spider-Man was into. {17769}{17818}Wonder Woman. {17846}{17897}Anyway, I was heading|towards this bakery... {17901}{18013}...to pick up a couple of dozen|linzer tortes for someone... {18056}{18139}...when out of nowhere, this thug|with a pipe jumps out and says: {18143}{18198}- ""Give me your money, punk!""|- Oh, my God. {18202}{18271}I know. And the worst part|was, they took my backpack... {18275}{18415}...which had all the original artwork I did|for my own comic book, ""Science Boy"". {18427}{18496}Oh, yeah! What was|his super power again? {18501}{18570}A super-human thirst for knowledge. {18623}{18660}I better get to class. {18664}{18741}Are there any more of your|friends I should look out for? {18746}{18820}No. Actually, you might want to stay|away from Jane Street. {18824}{18913}That's where Stabby Joe works. {18984}{19052}- I think we have a problem here.|- What? {19057}{19180}Back in my mugging days,|I worked St. Mark's Comics. {19184}{19293}- Yeah?|- A pipe was my weapon of choice... {19297}{19373}...and preteen, comic-book nerds|were my meat. {19416}{19441}So? {19446}{19529}There was one kid who had|a sticker on his backpack that said: {19534}{19587}- ""Geology rocks!""|- ""Geology rocks!"" {19662}{19756}- Oh, my God!|- I know! I mugged Ross! {19908}{19954}- You're late.|- I know. I'm sorry. {19958}{20000}But can I just run to the bathroom? {20005}{20101}- No. Leonard doesn't wait.|- But I am bursting with Yoo-hoo! {20132}{20194}Joey, here we go!|Let's go.

You did everything I asked.|- I did? {21047}{21133}Yes. Plus which, you've got this,|I don't know, this squirmy quality... {21145}{21209}...you bring to the character|I couldn't have imagined. {21214}{21250}Here's what we're gonna do: {21254}{21315}Come back tomorrow|for the final callbacks. {21319}{21394}Do all of this, what you got|going now.

Still in character.|I like him. {21678}{21793}I plant seeds. I can't explain it.|I don't know. {21894}{21961}- Hey. What are you doing?|- Putting on the sneakers... {21966}{22030}...to get in the young mindset,|see if it sparks anything. {22035}{22100}- Oh, anything yet?|- Yes, how's this? {22104}{22225}""They're so uncomfortable, it's like|getting kicked in the nuts for your feet."" {22552}{22614}You're probably wondering|what I'm doing. {22621}{22657}No, that seems about right. {22681}{22797}Yesterday at my audition, I had to pee.|Apparently, that makes me a good actor. {22801}{22873}I got a callback, so I'm drinking|everything. Oh, by the way... {22877}{22933}...that eggnog in our fridge was great! {22938}{23047}- Joey, that was formula.|- We gotta get more of that. {23094}{23198}These aren't half bad.

It was this huge dude. {24379}{24462}You don't have to lie anymore.|I know that it was a 14-year-old girl. {24467}{24504}- No, it wasn't.|- Yes, it was. {24509}{24609}You don't think I would have defended|myself against a 14-year-old...? {24614}{24703}- ""Give me your money, punk!""|- Oh, my God, it was you! {24740}{24834}I can't believe it. You mugged me? {24852}{24936}Yeah. And I'm so, so sorry, Ross.|I'm sorry. {24940}{25006}But, you know, if you think|about it, it's kind of neat. {25047}{25146}I mean, well, it's just that I've|always felt kind of like an outsider. {25150}{25235}You know, the rest of you have|connections that go way back... {25239}{25350}...and, you know, now you|and I have a great one. {25377}{25421}It's not the best! {25445}{25524}I know. Please forgive me.|I don't know what to say. {25529}{25618}There's nothing you can say! That was|the most humiliating thing ever. {25623}{25700}- Even more humiliating than...|- Let's not do this! {25774}{25864}And then, at the end of the commercial,|the girls get out of the hot tub... {25868}{25927}...and start making|out with each other. {25978}{26037}That's interesting. {26050}{26134}Just one thought: You didn't|mention the shoes. {26190}{26257}Who's next? Chandler. {26269}{26329}You start with a guy|putting on the shoes. {26333}{26382}- He's about my age.|- Your age? {26443}{26516}He's rolling down the street|and he starts to lose control. {26520}{26581}Maybe he falls.|Maybe he hurts himself. {26585}{26674}Just then, a kid comes flying|by wearing the shoes. {26678}{26765}He jumps over the old guy and laughs.|And the line reads: {26769}{26834}""Not suitable for adults."" {26855}{26950}- Well, Chandler, that's great.|- Thank you, sir. {26954}{27042}Or, man who's two|years younger than me. {27057}{27172}You see, that has a clear selling point.|It appeals to our key demographic. {27176}{27248}- How did you come up with that?|- I don't know! I don't know! {27252}{27389}I was just trying to get into a young|mindset, and stuff started to flow. {27435}{27505}- That is great. Good work.|- Thank you. {27510}{27574}We'll see all of you tomorrow. {27798}{27881}The cold weather hurts my hip. {27979}{28134}Hey, Ross.

Oh, sorry.|Sure, go ahead. {28255}{28330}I just really wanted to apologize again. {28334}{28450}And also show you something|I think you'll find very exciting. {28491}{28585}Oh, my God!

Sophisticated as it was. {14589}{14677}No, the thing I want to say is... {14685}{14746}Maybe we should've|talked about this before. {14751}{14853}Us living together,|you're not expecting a proposal, right? {14858}{14925}- Oh, no, no.

Perhaps... {15907}{15972}...a blond who always|uses the toilet? {16027}{16109}Except for once in the ocean. {16120}{16177}Look, it's not about who I would marry. {16181}{16265}I was certain the first time I got married|it'd last forever. I was wrong. {16271}{16335}- But, it just...|- Look, Phoebe, it's not about you. {16339}{16394}I just never want to get married again. {16468}{16507}I'm sorry. {16522}{16629}Are you okay with that? If not, maybe|us moving in together isn't the best idea. {16643}{16717}No. Oh, I definitely don't|want to get married. {16721}{16813}I just wanted to make sure|you didn't want to, too. {16845}{16913}Because if we move in|and you start changing your mind... {16917}{16962}...there is gonna be|hell to pay, mister. {16982}{17050}- Trust me.

I am warm... {18497}{18564}...for your form. {18601}{18681}Okay, you know the old classics like,|you know, ""You look nice""? {18685}{18711}They're still okay. {18722}{18798}But ""you look nice"" could mean|that I'm saying, ""Your face looks nice."" {18802}{18863}I want to compliment your body. {18877}{18949}I mean, I wouldn't change it at all. {18953}{19043}And more specifically, I wouldn't|want anything to get any bigger. {19078}{19108}- Okay.|- I mean... {19112}{19187}...you wouldn't want any part of me|to get any bigger, would you? {19260}{19315}Don't answer that. {19394}{19466}Just when you thought that dude|couldn't get any weirder. {19491}{19560}Why do you think he was so worried|about me getting bigger? {19565}{19641}I don't know.|I mean, what brought that on? {19646}{19715}Oh, my God. You know what,|we're trying to get pregnant... {19719}{19799}...so he's probably starting to freak out|that my body's gonna change. {19803}{19862}- You think that's what it is?|- You heard him. {19867}{19937}""No bigger. You're perfect.|Just don't get any bigger."" {19941}{20047}My God, he sounded just like|my high-school wrestling coach. {20105}{20179}- I'm gonna have to talk to Chandler.|- Yeah.

That marriage stinks. {21494}{21558}Yeah, marriage stinks. {21579}{21684}I mean, if you want to see a man gain|weight and a woman stop shaving... {21688}{21753}...get them married. {21757}{21831}- That's not how you really feel, is it?|- No, I'm sorry. {21860}{21969}I know it's not what you want to hear,|but I can't help it.

It's just cooler. {22204}{22298}Look, I know my marriages|didn't exactly work out... {22303}{22379}...but, you know, I loved being|that committed to another person. {22384}{22476}And Carol and I had some good times|before she became a lesbian. {22480}{22546}And once afterward. {22550}{22605}Anyway, I'm sorry. {22624}{22667}It's okay.

I mean, can you|honestly picture yourself in a Volvo? {27826}{27893}They are awfully boxy. {27897}{28037}I mean, I don't know, you'd be so bored|with marriage. I mean, it's so normal. {28079}{28117}Yeah. {28121}{28159}Hey, can I help? {28163}{28249}Well, we climbed up four flights of stairs,|maneuvered a narrow hallway... {28253}{28357}...dodged a rabid pit bull.

None at all? {28981}{29038}No, but you don't want to|get married either, right? {29044}{29072}Right. {29077}{29134}Except that I do want to get married. {29139}{29213}Couldn't have had this conversation|down at the truck, huh? {29243}{29283}What? You want to get married? {29297}{29327}Someday. {29332}{29410}And... hernia. {29447}{29589}I haven't had a normal life.

And|I love you, and I wanted to live with you. {29904}{29963}I want to live with you too.|I mean, let's do that. {29968}{30017}But I don't think I can. {30022}{30116}It was okay to move in when|I didn't know what was gonna happen. {30120}{30204}But I can't move in knowing nothing|is ever gonna happen. {30210}{30319}Can we at least try living together?

If you're just gonna hang out|as friends, then maybe I'll join you. {18769}{18835}You know, I'm your friend|and Mike's friend. {18912}{18963}Sit down. {19053}{19102}Make room for your friend. {19343}{19411}- So how have you been?|- I've been pretty good. {19526}{19621}- You look really beautiful.|- Thanks.

There were no responses. {21036}{21147}Nobody posted anything, nobody called|my parents, so the joke is on you. {21151}{21272}Nobody called, nobody wrote anything,|nobody cares that I'm dead. {21365}{21406}Oh, my God. {21411}{21498}- Nobody cares that I'm dead?|- Oh, come on, you know that's not true. {21502}{21560}What are you talking about?|You get 60 responses... {21564}{21605}...just for coming|out of the closet. {21609}{21688}I didn't get one response,|and I'm dead! {21692}{21798}Well, the gay community is a lot more|vocal than the dead community. {21802}{21944}I can't believe this. Not even my geology|lab partner. And I carried that guy! {21950}{21994}Look, let's think about this, okay? {21998}{22075}You think people are gonna disturb|your family at this tragic time? {22080}{22145}That people are gonna post condolences|on a website? {22149}{22192}This isn't about people not caring. {22196}{22316}This is about people not having|a decent outlet for their grief. {22320}{22385}- You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.|- Right. {22390}{22502}I'm sure if you had a funeral or memorial|service, tons of people would come. {22516}{22573}Exactly! {22592}{22650}Ross, what are you doing? {22654}{22710}You're having a memorial service|for yourself? {22719}{22819}No, that would be stupid.|You're having it for me. {22825}{22925}- Ross, don't press send.

That's great.|I'll propose to her. {8973}{9006}What? {9012}{9068}I was probably going to do it|at some point. {9074}{9138}- No, I didn't mean now.|- Well, why not?
